        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The gastrointestinal tract is emerging as a key regulator of appetite and metabolism, but daunting neuroanatomical complexity has hampered identification of the relevant signals. Invertebrate models could provide a simple and genetically amenable alternative, but their autonomic nervous system and its visceral functions remain largely unexplored. Here we develop a quantitative method based on defecation behavior to uncover a central role for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine in the regulation of nutrient intake, fluid, and ion balance. We then identify a key homeostatic role for autonomic neurons and hormones, including a brain-gut circuit of insulin-producing neurons modulating appetite, a vasopressin-like system essential for fluid homeostasis, and enteric neurons mediating sex peptide-induced changes in intestinal physiology. These conserved mechanisms of visceral control, analogous to those found in the enteric nervous system and hypothalamic/pituitary axis, enable the study of autonomic control in a model organism that has proved instrumental in understanding sensory and motor systems.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The homeostatic requirements arising from multicellularity contributed to the evolution of complex nervous systems able to adjust both behavior and visceral function on the basis of information about metabolic status and nutrient availability (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iversen et al., 2000</xref>). In mammals, the sensors and effectors of homeostatic metabolic changes are specific neuronal populations and brain/gut hormones which, when deregulated, can contribute to increasingly prevalent medical conditions such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="bib38 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sandoval et al., 2008; Strader and Woods, 2005</xref>). In this regard, the gastrointestinal tract is emerging as an important source of both neural and systemic signals regulating appetite and body weight (<xref rid="bib38 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sandoval et al., 2008; Strader and Woods, 2005</xref>). However, the intricate nature of these signals can make their study a challenging task. Indeed, autonomic fibers assemble into structurally complex and diverse neural circuits with the enteric nervous system, which, in humans, consists of ca. 500 million neurons. Moreover, the crosstalk between the digestive and nervous systems can also be mediated by a suite of enteroendocrine hormones, as well as those produced centrally by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (<xref rid="bib18 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Furness, 2006; Nussey and Whitehead, 2001</xref>). Such regulatory complexity is not conducive to the genetic study of homeostasis, which would benefit from manipulation of gene expression or neuronal function with temporal and spatial resolution.</p>
      <p>The simpler neuroanatomy and genetic amenability of invertebrate systems could provide an entry point into the study of metabolic homeostasis in more complex organisms. Recent studies have established functional orthology between mammalian and insect hormones, thereby contributing to the emergence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model for the study of metabolism (<xref rid="bib9 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Buch and Pankratz, 2009; Leopold and Perrimon, 2007</xref>). However, progress has been hampered by both our lack of detailed knowledge of the fly's autonomic neural circuits and the limited repertoire of behavioral and physiological readouts with which to investigate the internal control of nutrient intake and utilization. Consequently, the homeostatic regulation of visceral functions subsequent to the decision of whether or not to eat remains largely unexplored.</p>
      <p>Here we investigate the nature and relevance of visceral homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by developing an integrative method to quantify metabolic features, which we combine with mutant analyses and the selective manipulation of neuronal subsets. This uncovers a central role for the invertebrate intestine in the integration of neural, nutritional, and reproductive information to adjust nutrient intake and utilization. Furthermore, it reveals extensive and essential autonomic and systemic control of visceral functions by both novel and conserved neural substrates, analogous to those found in the mammalian enteric nervous system and hypothalamic/pituitary gland.</p>

        <title>Distinct Domains of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Intestine Are Innervated by Both Efferent and Sensory Neurons</title>
        <p>In contrast to the sensory and motor systems, the visceral nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> was largely uncharacterized. The use of multiple markers and reporters revealed complex innervation of the adult intestine, which is confined to three distinct portions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A–1D and see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>A–S1C available online). The presence of neurites positive for the motor neuron reporter <italic>OK371-Gal4</italic> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>D–S1F) in these three innervated segments containing valves or sphincters suggests modulation of intestinal transit by neural control of smooth muscle function. Interestingly, in addition to this superficial innervation of intestinal muscles, we also observed a subset of fibers which, analogous to mammalian submucosal fibers (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Furness, 2006</xref>), project through contiguous circular muscles toward the underlying epithelial layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E–1G).</p>
        <p>While at least some of the enteric fibers innervating the anterior portion of the digestive tract originate from peripheral cell bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A), the other two innervated portions (pylorus and rectal ampulla/rectum) receive innervation from cell bodies located in the central nervous system (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>J and S1K). However, not all of the innervation of the digestive tract is efferent. Indeed, the combined use of sensory neuron drivers and dendritic markers revealed sensory innervation of the esophagus and proventriculus and the presence of one to three peripheral sensory neurons innervating the posterior portion of the hindgut (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>H–1J and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>G–S1I).</p>
        <p>In sum, our anatomical analyses reveal extensive sensory and efferent innervation of both intestinal muscles and epithelial cells, which is confined to discrete portions of the digestive tract.</p>

        <title>A New Metabolic Behavior Reveals Homeostatic Control of Food Intake, Intestinal Transit, Diuresis, and Acid-Base Balance in Adult Flies</title>
        <p>A functional readout was required to explore the homeostatic significance of this innervation. We reasoned that the material excreted by adult flies may provide an integrated readout of digestive and excretory status since the renal tubules discharge into the intestine at the midgut-hindgut boundary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). To measure overall defecation rates, we supplemented standard fly food with a modified lipid probe which only becomes fluorescent after exposure to the fly's digestive tract (referred to as Fluoropoo, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A–2D, see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for details), thereby allowing us to quantify the total number of excreta produced (including those deposited on the food, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). We found defecation rate to be modulated by diet in a manner predictive of food intake, as measured by the CAFE assay (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ja et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>L and 2M). Although this is a less direct measure of food intake than the CAFE assay and requires two additional controls (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), it can be performed in dietary conditions more comparable to those in which the flies were bred.</p>
        <p>In addition to providing quantitative information about intestinal emptying rate, we were able to extract further information about the nature of <italic>Drosophila</italic> excreta by using the pH indicator dye Bromophenol blue (BPB, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E–2G) to obtain colored deposits, which we then analyzed semiautomatedly to extract quantitative information about size, shape, concentration, and color (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>, and <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for details). The use of another pH indicator and experiments with diets of defined acidity and water content validated the use of this method to quantify the pH and fluid content of excreta, and revealed dietary modulation of both (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>H–2K).</p>
        <p>In sum, this semiautomatic analysis of fly excreta provides an integrated physiological readout for food intake, acid-base balance and diuresis, which reveals dietary modulation of intestinal emptying rate, pH, and fluid content.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Intestinal Acid-Base Homeostasis Is Modulated by Diet and Internal Reproductive State</title>
        <p>The dietary modulation of excreta pointed to a homeostatic role for the intestine. Experiments with defined diets containing different sucrose/protein ratios, but which were otherwise the same pH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, insets), revealed that the posterior hindgut (analogous to the large intestine) differentially adjusts the final pH of excreta when flies are fed on diets known to lead to distinct metabolic states (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zinke et al., 2002</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A): indeed, acidification of deposits and hindgut contents was always apparent in sucrose-fed flies but was never observed in a protein-rich diet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A, 3B, and 3E). Interestingly, dietary restriction (a regime that can lead to life span extension in many organisms and which, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is implemented by dilution of the food medium in water [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Piper et al., 2005</xref>]) also led to persistent acidification of intestinal contents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). This effect, observed under conditions which did not affect the dietary sugar/yeast ratio, suggested that the dietary modulation of acid-base balance does not passively result from the differential utilization of specific metabolic pathways. Analysis of mutants for the transcription factor <italic>foxo</italic>, which orchestrates changes in metabolic gene expression in response to starvation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>), revealed that while the pH shift induced by a sugar-only diet occurred normally in these mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G), their shift to a more acidic pH in response to nutrient scarcity was impaired (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). This confirmed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine modulates the final composition of intestinal contents in response to diet-induced changes in internal metabolism, and indicated that diet composition and nutrient concentration impact on intestinal pH through two distinct mechanisms.</p>
        <p>We then wondered whether, in addition to environmental dietary challenges, internal nutritional challenges such as those associated with reproduction also impact on intestinal acid-base homeostasis. The sexually dimorphic nature of fecal output (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B) is consistent with this hypothesis: females, which produce large and nutrient-rich gametes, show acidification of excreta reminiscent of that caused by the lack of nutrients or protein. Modulation of acid-base homeostasis by egg production was corroborated by the fecal output of <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> sterile females, which is more similar to that of wild-type virgin males than to that of wild-type virgin females (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A, 4E, and 4F, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A), and was further confirmed by additional genetic manipulations which differentially interfered with oogenesis and/or egg laying (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A). These genetic manipulations also suggested that the differential pH is specifically caused by the nutritional demands associated with vitellogenesis.</p>
        <p>Together, these results indicate that, like its human counterpart (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Charney and Dagher, 1996</xref>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> large intestine modulates the final composition of intestinal contents. Interestingly, it can do so in response to changes in internal metabolism, a role that has been proposed but not directly shown for human colonic absorption (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Charney and Dagher, 1996</xref>).</p>

        <title>A Very Small Subset of Intestinal Neurons Modulates Intestinal Fluid Balance in Response to a Reproductive Hormone</title>
        <p>The complex modulation of enteric physiology during pregnancy in humans (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2008</xref>) prompted us to investigate whether, in addition to pH, reproduction affected additional aspects of intestinal homeostasis. Our assay revealed dramatic changes triggered in females by mating. First, mated females defecate on food more often than virgin females or males do: probably a result of their increased egg laying activity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>C). Second, in spite of increasing their food intake (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>), their intestinal transit is markedly decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). This is accompanied by a remarkable change in intestinal physiology, whereby their intestinal contents and fecal output become more concentrated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>D), and they frequently excrete a subpopulation of oblong, even more concentrated deposits (referred to as reproductive oblong deposits or RODs, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4D). These intestinal changes result from the action of the male-derived sex peptide (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>) on its neural receptor in the female, as revealed by the reduced ROD production resulting from neuronal downregulation of the sex peptide receptor (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>G). Additional experiments in which sterile <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> or <italic>egalitarian</italic> mutant females were mated to wild-type or sex peptide mutant males further confirmed a requirement for the sex peptide in these changes in fluid balance, and established that they are uncoupled from egg production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E, 4G, and 4H, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>B and S5C) or food intake (<xref rid="bib13 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2006; Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>), given that <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> females do not increase their food intake after mating (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, they appear to fulfill a water-preserving function, because they can be independently modulated by dietary water: virgin females (and males, albeit less frequently) can excrete RODs under conditions of reduced fluid availability (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>E and S4F, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>I).</p>
        <p>To identify the neural effectors of these sex-peptide-triggered changes in fluid homeostasis, we selectively inactivated subsets of neurons by expressing the hyperpolarizing channel Kir2.1 from a collection of <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers. Reduced ROD production was observed upon silencing of <italic>HGN1-Gal4</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E and 5F), which only showed reproducible expression in a group of two to five hindgut-innervating neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). In addition to innervating the circular muscles or the rectal valve and rectum, these neurons innervate the epithelium underlying the rectal valve and the inner muscle layer of the rectum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5C′). Importantly, this line does not show expression in neurons innervating the female reproductive tract (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Together, the results presented in this and the previous section indicate that, in addition to external nutrient availability, internal reproductive state impacts on postfeeding homeostatic processes involving pH and fluid balance in the intestine. Furthermore, they identify a group of epithelium-innervating intestinal neurons previously unknown in invertebrates as effectors of the intestinal changes in fluid homeostasis triggered by a reproductive hormone.</p>

        <title>The Digestive/Excretory System Responds to an Essential Vasopressin-like Systemic Signal to Maintain Fluid Homeostasis</title>
        <p>The dietary modulation of aspects of fluid homeostasis other than ROD production (namely, fluid content and intestinal emptying rate, Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, respectively) suggested additional mechanisms of fluid control. We hypothesized that the insect hormone leucokinin (LK), which can stimulate fluid secretion in vitro (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">O'Donnell et al., 1998</xref>) and is known to be released into the circulatory system by a small group of central neurons (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cantera and Nassel, 1992</xref>), may be relevant to the regulation of water homeostasis in vivo. We confined our genetic manipulations to adult male flies to bypass developmental effects (data not shown). Overactivation of LK neurons by expression of the heat-activated dTrpA1 ion channel resulted in increased diuresis, as revealed by the presence of lighter (less concentrated) and more abundant deposits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). By contrast, the genetic silencing of LK neurons elicited by expression of Kir2.1 (confined to adults using a <italic>tubulin-Gal80ts</italic> transgene) resulted in concentrated deposits of much smaller size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>D–6F), which were already apparent 24 hr after inactivation. Persistent inactivation over a longer period of time doubled defecation rate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>J), which we interpret as a compensatory mechanism to attempt to excrete excess fluid. Consistent with this idea, flies became extremely bloated and had highly enlarged abdomens (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>G and 6H). Unlike the bloating resulting from a very full crop reported for leucokinin hypomorphic mutants after starvation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>), the swelling that we observed in fully fed, humid conditions is caused by excessive fluid retention outside the gut, as revealed by dry/wet weight experiments and examination of abdominal contents (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S1</xref>), and can occasionally lead to abdominal rupture (data not shown).</p>
        <p>LK has recently been shown to regulate meal size through its action on neuronal leucokinin receptors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>), but the additional expression of LK receptors in the renal tubules and the digestive tract (<xref rid="bib35 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Radford et al., 2002; Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>) suggested a systemic mode of action in the regulation of fluid homeostasis. To test this idea, we selectively downregulated the expression of LK and its receptor in specific tissues using RNA interference (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>). This confirmed that LK acts as a central neurohormone on its receptor in nonneural tissues to control fluid balance, in a manner analogous to mammalian vasopressin (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nussey and Whitehead, 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, these findings indicate that visceral homeostasis in invertebrates is not only regulated by direct autonomic innervation but is also under the control of systemic signals emanating from the central nervous system.</p>

        <title>An Insulinergic Brain-Gut Neuronal Circuit Adjusts Feeding to Nutritional Conditions</title>
        <p>Having established that intestinal homeostasis is subject to neuronal and systemic regulation, we wondered whether the role of intestinal neurons can extend beyond their local action to affect behaviors related to nutrient intake or processing. Our previous work had established that about half of the Ilp7 neurons, a small group of 16–20 insulinergic neurons with cell bodies located in the ventral ganglion (analogous to the spinal cord), innervate the adult hindgut (pylorus and rectal ampulla, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref rid="bib7 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Brogiolo et al., 2001; Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2008</xref>). Inactivation of Ilp7 neurons had no apparent effect under normal feeding conditions (data not shown). However, we observed that flies with Ilp7-silenced neurons overreact to poor nutritional conditions by increasing their food intake faster than control flies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>F and 7G, additional controls in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>A and S7C; males were used to circumvent phenotypes secondary to egg production).</p>
        <p>A subpopulation of Ilp7 neurons does not innervate the hindgut (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2008</xref>), thus raising the possibility that the observed effect on food intake is not related to intestinal innervation. Detailed examination of the neuroanatomy of Ilp7 neurons revealed that in the ventral ganglion, the dendrites of the hindgut-innervating Ilp7 neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 7B″, white arrow) are densely arborized with those of another subset of Ilp7 neurons located in more anterior segments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 7B″, arrowhead). The axonal terminals of these neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and B′, yellow arrow) appear to make direct synaptic contact with dendrites emanating from the small group of 10–14 brain median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>D and 7E) which express three different insulin-like peptides (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Broughton et al., 2005</xref>) and, in the adult, also innervate the intestine further anteriorly (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7C; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Brown, 2001</xref>). In contrast to Ilp7 neuron inactivation, mNSC silencing led to a persistent hypophagic response to nutrient scarcity, as indicated by their reduced fecal output (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>H and 7I, additional controls in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>B and S7D).</p>
        <p>Together, our results identify a neuronal circuit consisting of two groups of insulin-producing neurons, which have release sites on all three innervated intestinal domains and function to adjust feeding in response to nutrient scarcity. Anatomical analysis of their neuronal connectivity suggests that the differential modulation of food intake by these two populations may be achieved, at least partly, by synaptic modulation of mNSCs by Ilp7 neurons.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our work has uncovered a central role for the intestine in the execution of extensive (and previously uncharacterized in invertebrates) homeostatic regulation subsequent to the decision whether or not to eat, and has identified intestinal neurons and systemic signals as key mediators of the crosstalk between internal organs. The implications of our findings are discussed below.</p>
      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>Between What Goes in and What Comes Out: Nutrition, Reproduction, Longevity, and the Intestine</title>
        <p>Our experiments provide evidence for significant regulation of nutrient utilization independent of intake. For example, we find intestinal transit to be differentially modulated by a low-calorie diet and reproductive state: two conditions known to increase food intake. In contrast to the faster emptying rate associated with a low-calorie diet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>M), the action of a reproductive hormone (the sex peptide) leads to concentration of intestinal contents and slower intestinal transit in mated females (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>D). This effect is strikingly similar to that of progesterone, oxytocin, and estrogen on intestinal passage, secretion, and water absorption, which cause bloating and constipation during pregnancy (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2008</xref>). These reproductive gastrointestinal changes may be associated with enhanced nutrient absorption: a possible competitive advantage at a time of high nutritional demands.</p>
        <p>The differential enteric physiology of mated females and diet-restricted flies also points to a link between internal diuresis and life span, whereby longevity would be associated with faster intestinal transit and/or diets with a higher water/calorie ratio. This would explain the recently reported deleterious effects of water-poor dietary regimes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ja et al., 2009</xref>), and why the impact on life span of dietary restriction (positive) and mating (deleterious in females) is not entirely attributable to calorie intake or egg production (<xref rid="bib5 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2008; Mair et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we also find that sterile <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> mutant females, which do not increase their long-term food intake after mating but still experience mating survival costs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>), also concentrate excreta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4G). It will be interesting to establish how intestinal physiology is affected by the amino acid imbalance recently found to account for the life-shortening effects of certain diets (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, it will be instructive to investigate how intestinal flora affects or is affected by the reproductive changes in enteric physiology triggered by mating, diet, and internal metabolic state. Increasing evidence points to a differential role for specific phyla of gut bacteria in nutrient acquisition, energy regulation, and obesity (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>). Given the relative simplicity of the intestinal microbial consortium of lab-reared <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Gilmore, 2007</xref>), our behavioral and physiological readouts could easily be exploited to investigate the interactions between this bacterial diversity and organismal homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Intestinal Neurons, Feeding, and Metabolism</title>
        <p>The organizational principles of mammalian enteric nervous systems are broadly conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In contrast to the gut of nematode worms (which is devoid of direct innervation, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Avery and Thomas, 1997</xref>), we find the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine to be extensively innervated by sensory and efferent fibers confined to three discrete portions containing smooth muscle sphincters or valves: a neural architecture suggestive of “checkpoints” where intestinal transit may be sensed and modulated. Interestingly, we have also observed that a subset of enteric neurons innervate the underlying intestinal epithelium, and have found that at least one such lineage effects changes in water balance associated with reproduction. This kind of innervation has not been previously described in invertebrates, and is reminiscent of the fibers of the submucosal plexus, which regulate epithelial crypt cell secretion in mammals (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Furness, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>The direct innervation of the adult intestine by insulinergic fibers suggests a novel mode of action for Ilps. Although Ilp2 appears to act systemically to regulate larval growth (<xref rid="bib3 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Arquier et al., 2008; Geminard et al., 2009</xref>), endogenous Ilps have not so far been detected in the circulation. Hence, it is possible that Ilps modulate intestinal physiology locally to regulate food intake (and perhaps some of the previously reported mNSC functions in glucose homeostasis and energy storage, <xref rid="bib8 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Broughton et al., 2005; Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). In humans and other mammals, neural and hormonal signals originating from the intestine can promote satiety and modulate pancreatic insulin secretion (<xref rid="bib16 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Das, 2010; Strader and Woods, 2005</xref>). Insulin could, in turn, convey information about nutritional state to the intestine, which would integrate additional signals (such as those that we have found to emanate from reproductive tissues or diuretic centers) to regulate nutrient processing or the production of intestinal satiety signals. Such intestinal roles would be consistent with the finding of isolated insulin-producing secretory cells in the digestive tract of other invertebrates and protochordates (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sherwood et al., 2005</xref>). In this regard, the positioning of the ring gland (which is profusely innervated by mNSC fibers) in close proximity to the esophagus and anterior midgut of adult flies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7C) is strikingly reminiscent of the islet organ of primitive vertebrates such as hagfish: a discrete aggregation of insulin-producing cells found in the same anatomical location (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jorgensen et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, the acquisition of insulinergic fate by endocrine organs of different evolutionary origin (<xref rid="bib24 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jorgensen et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2007</xref>) may reflect a shared requirement for a local source of insulin release close to the intestine. In any event, it suggests that a differential developmental origin (brain and gut insulins) does not necessarily imply functional diversification.</p>

        <title>Neural Control of Internal Fluid Homeostasis</title>
        <p>We have uncovered an essential role for a very restricted group of central neuroendocrine cells in the systemic regulation of diuresis: a role strikingly similar to the effect on the kidney of vasopressin, a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary gland into the blood stream (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nussey and Whitehead, 2001</xref>). Loss of LK signaling has acute effects: fluid retention is such that adult wet weight almost doubles within a few days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I), eventually leading to death. This effect contrasts with the relatively modest weight alterations resulting from interfering with adult feeding, energy storage, or developmental growth (for example, see <xref rid="bib26 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>). The importance of fluid regulation, both during development and in adult homeostasis, may therefore have been underestimated. The connections between water consumption, energy intake, and body weight in humans are poorly understood (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Yao and Roberts, 2001</xref>). Our work and a recent study (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>) point to a model wherein one neurohormone (LK) acts on the same receptor centrally to regulate food intake and peripherally to maintain fluid balance.</p>
        <p>The recent discovery of axonal terminals emanating from water-sensing neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>), where leucokinin-positive dendrites arborize (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">de Haro et al., 2010</xref>), suggests sensory input into this vasopressin-like system. Phenotypes like the one resulting from LK neuron silencing provide a behavioral readout with which to test this idea or investigate the nature of possible internal osmolality sensors.</p>

        <title>A Metabolic Behavior in an Invertebrate</title>
        <p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the genetic analysis of defecation rate has proved to be an excellent system with which to identify developmental or metabolic genes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Branicky and Hekimi, 2006</xref>). Our assay allows quantification of additional aspects of diuresis, enteric function, and food intake. It is thus the first integrative behavioral readout for metabolism in an invertebrate, which can be used in high-throughput screens for genes or compounds regulating diuresis, gastrointestinal physiology, ion transport, and their neural, nutritional, and reproductive control. In particular, having uncovered at least two distinct mechanisms of nutritional modulation of acid-base homeostasis (only one of which is <italic>foxo</italic> dependent), it will now be of interest to use the pH of excreta as a readout for genetic screens aimed at identifying the metabolic pathways involved, the intestinal mechanisms of pH regulation, and the contribution and site of action of the large number of previously reported <italic>foxo</italic> targets (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>). In parallel, our assay will also enable future studies aimed at establishing the contribution of specific neurons, peptides, and cell populations, such as gut stem cells and enteroendocrine cells, to gastrointestinal function and organismal homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Defecation and Intestinal Assays using Food Dyes</title>
        <p>After boiling, food was allowed to cool down to 60°C–65°C before it was supplemented with 0.5% Bromophenol blue sodium salt (B5525, Sigma), 0.5% Bromocresol purple sodium salt (17492, Sigma), and/or 0.03% Fluoropoo (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, BODIPY 493/503, Invitrogen). All three dyes were found to be nontoxic to flies and to remain in the digestive tract until they were excreted. Neither BPB nor Fluoropoo was found to affect food intake (measured as ingested volume using the CAFE assay after a 24 hr acclimation period, data not shown). Dissections of dye-containing intestines were performed in saline, leaving the head and posterior cuticle intact to prevent dye leak. Defecation rate experiments and ROD quantification experiments were performed on 10–30 flies, which were individually placed in clear plastic cuvettes (UV grade PPMA cuvettes, Kartell) containing 0.5 ml of food supplemented with BPB (alone or in combination with Fluoropoo). Analyses of the nature of excreta (including color, shape, size, and dye intensity) were conducted as above for individual flies, or in 50 mm petri dishes (Sterilin) containing food supplemented with BPB and groups of eight to ten flies. Digital images of petri lids or cuvette walls were obtained using an Epson Perfection 4990 Photo scanner. Whole-image background adjustment was applied using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

        <title>Quantitative Analysis of Defecation Behavior</title>
        <p>Quantification of excreta was performed manually using cuvettes housing single flies. Digital scans were analyzed for qualitative traits such as color or shape features using Volocity 64 software (Improvision). Briefly, deposits were automatically identified through a saturation and intensity filter (Find Objects Using HSI), corrected for noise and presence of holes (Remove Noise From Objects, Fill Holes in Objects), and filtered by size. The specific filtering values applied were adapted to each experimental scan, but were always identical for all compared samples. Manual correction was employed to remove false positives (e.g., food debris), add individual deposits not identified by the filter, and correct software misinterpretations (e.g., overlapping deposits). Color (Mean Red, Mean Green and Mean Blue) and size (Pixel Count and Perimeter) values were exported to the R environment (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2009</xref>) and converted to Hue, Saturation, Lightness values according to previously described formulas (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agoston, 2005</xref>). Dye intensity was calculated as 100 − lightness. Hue density graphs display the population distribution of the hue variable as a continuous estimate smoothed by a Gaussian kernel (R density function, bandwidth = 7, n ≥ 130 deposits per set in all graphs shown, except for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D, in which bandwidth = 10, n ≥ 50).</p>

In dietary restriction experiments, single flies reared in standard food supplemented with BPB were transferred to cuvettes containing either a nutritious diet (5.4% sucrose, 3.6% autolysed yeast flakes, 0.5% BPB, 0.18% Nipagin) or food with low nutritional value (0.9% sucrose, 0.6% autolysed yeast flakes, 0.5% BPB, 0.18% Nipagin). After the desired time had elapsed, cuvettes were emptied by transferring the single flies to new cuvettes and deposits were counted.</p>

The anterior-most segment comprises the esophagus, esophageal valve, and anterior midgut (proventriculus, analogous to the human stomach, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wigglesworth, 1972</xref>) and is innervated both centrally and by the peripheral corpus cardiacum/hypocerebral ganglion. Following a midgut segment devoid of innervations, central fibers innervate the pyloric valve (which regulates the entry of midgut and renal tubule contents into the hindgut) and, following a short noninnervated ileum segment, the terminal portion of the intestine including the rectal valve, rectal ampulla, and rectum. This innervation pattern was confirmed with the panneuronal <italic>n-syb-Gal4</italic> line (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>) and eight other broadly expressed driver lines or antibodies (data not shown).</p>

        <p>New Quantitative Methods to Assess Intestinal Functions</p>
        <p>(A–D) Strong fluorescence is apparent in intact (A) and dissected guts (B) and the excreta of Fluoropoo-fed flies, both on food (C, arrows) and on the clear walls of vials (D). The deposits from a mixed population have two distinct shapes (D, inset): round and oblong.</p>
        <p>(E–G) Shown are intestinal contents in BPB-fed intact flies (E) and dissected intestinal tracts (F). Like with Fluoropoo, no dye is apparent in the renal tubules (F, arrow) or fat body (F, arrowhead). (G) BPB-labeled deposits differ in their color and concentration. Round and oblong shapes are also apparent (G, inset). Oblong deposits are typically more concentrated. Scale bar, 1 mm.</p>
        <p>(H) Defined amounts of acid or base change the pH and color of BPB-supplemented food (top panels, insets). The color range of the resulting deposits shifts accordingly (top panels). Hue density distributions indicate that the majority of deposits cluster at specific hue points depending on the pH of the food.</p>
        <p>(I) Male flies fed drier food (standard food dried for 2 hr at 40°C) produce more concentrated deposits (increased average dye intensity, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 10 flies/set). This phenotype is rescued when flies fed on this dry food have additional access to water (p = 0.015 when compared to dry food, not significant when compared to standard food, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 10 flies/set).</p>
        <p>(J and K) Two pH indicators with a different pH range (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for details) reveal pH changes along the intestinal tract under normal conditions (standard diet, pH 5.5). Hindgut contents are acidified just posterior to the renal tubules (J, purple to light orange). Further acidification occurs just prior to excretion in the rectum (K, blue to yellow).</p>
        <p>(L) Compensatory increase in feeding upon food dilution in the 135–15 g/L range, as measured by the CAFE assay (p &lt; 0.001 135 g/L versus 45 g/L, p = 0.0095 45 g/L versus 15 g/L, p = 0.0018 135 g/L versus 15 g/L, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 14 flies/set, although only five flies were left in the 15 g/L group after 72 hr due to the high lethality caused by this low-calorie diet).</p>
        <p>(M) Differences in fecal output resulting from the same dilution series quantified using our assay (p &lt; 0.001 135 g/L versus 45 g/L, p = 0.19 45 g/L versus 15 g/L, p &lt; 0.0001 135 g/L versus 15 g/L, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 15 flies/set). No lethality was observed by 72 hr in the low-calorie 15 g/L diet.</p>

        <p>Dietary Regulation of Intestinal Acid-Base Balance</p>
        <p>(A) Regulation of fecal pH by diet composition. pH changes result from differential metabolism because all three diets were adjusted to the same initial pH (food color is shown in insets). The total concentration of all three diets was 45 g/L.</p>
        <p>(B) Hue density plots of excreta resulting from 100% sucrose (yellow plot), 40% yeast/60% sucrose (green), and 80% yeast/20% sucrose (blue) diets (p &lt; 0.0001 for all three comparisons, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</p>
        <p>(C) Regulation of fecal pH by progressive dilution of a balanced diet with a constant 40% yeast, 60% sucrose ratio.</p>
        <p>(D) Hue density plots of excreta resulting from 90 g/L (blue), 45 g/L (green), and 15 g/L (yellow) diets (p &lt; 0.0001 for all three comparisons, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</p>
        <p>(E) The acidification of excreta in sugar-fed flies occurs in the rectum. Note the change from blue to orange/red immediately posterior to the rectal valve (arrow). By contrast, intestinal contents remain basic in the hindgut of flies that have been fed a high fat/protein diet.</p>
        <p>(F) In <italic>foxo</italic> mutants, the shift to a more acidic pH triggered by a low-calorie diet is partly impaired, unlike that of control (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) flies. The hue density plot of <italic>foxo</italic> mutants does not peak at the red/orange hues indicative of acidic excreta (p &lt; 0.0001, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The pH of their excreta and intestinal morphology was indistinguishable from that of control flies in fully fed conditions (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>B–S3I and data not shown). In the next 48 hr, <italic>foxo</italic> mutants do shift to a more acidic pH fully, but this is accompanied by very high lethality (data not shown). The same results were obtained with a different <italic>foxo</italic> mutant combination (<italic>foxo<sup>w24</sup>/foxo<sup>21</sup></italic>, data not shown).</p>
        <p>(G) The effect of a sugar-only diet on acid-base balance is not affected in <italic>foxo</italic> mutants. The hue density plots of both controls and <italic>foxo</italic> mutants peak at red/orange hues.</p>

        <p>Effects of Reproduction on Intestinal Physiology</p>
        <p>(A) Shown is representative fecal output of virgin or mated males and females. Although each subpanel consists of excreta of three to six flies, quantitative analyses were conducted on larger groups of flies (n = 9–12 flies, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref> for details).</p>
        <p>(B) The defecation rate of wild-type mated females is lower than that of virgin females (p = 0.007, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 10 flies/set).</p>
        <p>(C) The intestinal contents of mated females are more concentrated than those of virgin females. Concentration is already apparent in the crop and anterior midgut (arrows), suggesting a change in intestinal fluid retention.</p>
        <p>(D) Oblong deposits are very concentrated excreta. Left graph shows the distribution of deposits by area and perimeter in relation to circular shapes (lower black line, p = 2π√(a/π)) and an arbitrarily defined oblong shape (a 3 × 1 rectangle, upper black line, p = 8√[a/3]); dye intensity is represented in grayscale for each deposit. The subpopulation of noncircular deposits (p ≥ 8√[a/3] and area ≤ 200 px, boxed in red) is significantly darker than the population as a whole (right graph, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 12 flies).</p>
        <p>(E) Shown are fecal outputs of <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> virgin and mated females, which lack functional ovaries.</p>
        <p>(F) The majority of excreta in <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> virgin females are blue (basic). This contrasts with the wild-type profile of control OreR virgin females, which peaks around more acidic orange/green hues (p &lt; 0.0001, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</p>
        <p>(G) Mating increases the relative frequency of concentrated RODs in both <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> controls (brown bars) and <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> females (blue bars, p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 9–10 flies/set).

        <p>Central Diuretic Neurons Regulate Fluid Homeostasis</p>
        <p>(A) Water availability modulates a starvation-induced reduction in defecation rate. Both nutrient and nutrient/water deprivation lead to a reduction in defecation rate when compared to fed flies (p = 0.015 and p = 0.001, respectively, Student's t test, n = 8 flies/set), but the total number of excreta over a period of 11 hr is much smaller in the absence of nutrients and water than when water is available (p &lt; 0.001, Student's t test, n = 8 flies/set).</p>
        <p>(B) Compared to controls, flies in which LK neurons have been overactivated for 24 hr produce lighter deposits (many of which are hardly visible).</p>
        <p>(C) Their defecation rate is higher than that of controls (p = 0.021 against <italic>Gal4</italic> control and p &lt; 0.001 against <italic>UAS</italic> control, Student's t test, n = 17–20 flies/set).</p>
        <p>(D) Adult-specific inactivation of LK neurons results in smaller, more concentrated deposits than those excreted by wild-type controls (left and right panels). This phenotype is apparent after only 24 hr. The scale bar corresponds to 1 mm and applies to all three images.</p>
        <p>(E) Quantification of deposit size. Flies with inactive LK neurons excrete smaller deposits (p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test).</p>
        <p>(F) LK neuron inactivation leads to the production of small, dark deposits. Size is inversely correlated to dye intensity in individual deposits excreted by <italic>LK &gt; Kir2.1</italic> flies (blue trend line, p &lt; 0.0001, linear model fit, displaying least-squares line) but not in either of the control groups (p = 0.19 for <italic>Gal4</italic> control, 0.17 for <italic>UAS</italic> control). Note the subpopulation of small and very dark deposits (shaded box) which is produced almost exclusively by <italic>LK &gt; Kir2.1</italic> flies.</p>
        <p>(G) A longer period of LK neuron inactivation (4 days) leads to bloated flies. The scale bar corresponds to 1 mm and applies to all three images.</p>
        <p>(H) The abdominal diameter of these flies is much larger than that of control flies (p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 24–30 flies/set).</p>
        <p>(I) Their average weight is much larger than that of the two controls (p &lt; 0.001, Student's t test, n ≥ 24 flies/set). The weight difference is caused by fluid retention because the dry weights of all three genotypes, represented by the dark portions of all three bars, are comparable. In fact, the dry weight of LK-silenced flies is marginally lower (p = 0.001 or lower, Student's t test).</p>
        <p>(J) The defecation rate of flies in which LK neurons have been inactivated for 4 days is higher than that of control flies (p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 10 flies/set).</p>

        <p>Differential Regulation of the Homeostatic Response to Nutrient Scarcity by a Brain-Gut Circuit of Insulin-Producing Neurons</p>
        <p>(A) Shown is connectivity of the two small subsets of central neurons expressing insulin-like peptides: the mNSCs, with cell bodies located in the protocerebrum, and Ilp7 neurons in the ventral ganglion. Cell bodies are depicted as circles. Dendritic endings are shown as branches, whereas axonal terminals are shown as empty triangles.</p>
        <p>(B–B″) Shown are Ilp7 neurons colabeled with an anti-Ilp7 antibody and a membrane-tagged <italic>UAS-myr-mRFP</italic> reporter. Two axonal fibers emanating from Ilp7 cell bodies in the ventral ganglion terminate in the subesophageal ganglion, as indicated by the abundance of vesicles positive for Ilp7 (B′). Note the profuse dendritic arborizations in the ventral ganglion (B″), which are relatively devoid of Ilp7 peptide (compare the strong green signal of B′ to B″). nc82 is used as a general neuropil marker in (B)–(E).</p>
        <p>(C) mNSC axons, labeled by their expression of a membrane-tagged reporter from <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic>, reach the ring gland, which in the adult is found at the junction between the stomach, esophagus, and crop duct. Additional nerves project along the crop duct and arborize on the crop muscles.</p>
        <p>(D) Dendrites emanating from the mNSCs (visualized by their expression of <italic>UAS-myr-mRFP</italic> from <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic>, displayed in green) reach the subesophageal ganglion where Ilp7 axons (labeled with anti-Ilp7 antibody and displayed in red) terminate. For the sake of consistency with other panels, the green and red channels have been inverted in (D) and (E).</p>
        <p>(E) Single, high-magnification optical slice showing one punctum coexpressing Ilp7, <italic>Ilp2 &gt; myr-mRFP</italic> and the synaptic marker nc82, suggesting synaptic contact between Ilp7 axons and mNSC dendrites.</p>
        <p>(F) Increased fecal output of Ilp7 neuron-silenced flies relative to controls on a low-calorie diet for 48 hr. The shift to more orange hues occurs normally.</p>
        <p>(G) Time course analysis of defecation rate under dietary restriction. After 24 hr, only flies with genetically inactivated Ilp7 neurons have increased defecation rate (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.029, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's combined probability test of two experiments, n ≥ 28 flies/set. Graphs and statistics are displayed for one of the two experiments). After a longer period of nutrient deprivation (72 hr), there are no significant differences between the defecation rate of controls and Ilp7 neuron-silenced flies. We could not measure food intake directly using the CAFE assay due to the high lethality associated with this food dilution when supplied in liquid form, but we confirmed that the increased fecal output results from increased food intake, because it is not accompanied by reduced gut capacity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>A) or a decrease in the dye content of excreta (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>(H) Fecal outputs of control and mNSC-silenced flies fed a low-calorie diet for 48 hr. Inactivation of mNSC neurons was confined to the late third-instar stage onward using a late <italic>Gal4</italic> driver to circumvent defects associated with reduced growth during development. Flies with genetically inactivated mNSCs excrete fewer deposits. The shift to more orange hues occurs normally.</p>
        <p>(I) Time course analysis of defecation rate following the nutritional challenge. After 24 hr, the defecation rate of mNSC-silenced flies tends to be lower than that of control flies (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.23, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's combined probability test of two experiments, n ≥ 28 flies/set). After 72 hr, their defecation rate becomes significantly lower than that of controls (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's combined probability test of two experiments, n ≥ 28 flies/set). Graphs and statistics are displayed for one of the two experiments. As in the case of mNSC inactivation, intestinal capacity and dye content controls confirmed that these changes are reflective of food intake (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>B, S7D, and 7H).</p>
