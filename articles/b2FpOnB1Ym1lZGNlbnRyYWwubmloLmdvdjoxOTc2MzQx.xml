        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Human mitochondria contain their own genome, encoding 13 polypeptides that are synthesized within the organelle. The molecular processes that govern and facilitate this mitochondrial translation remain unclear. Many key factors have yet to be characterized—for example, those required for translation termination. All other systems have two classes of release factors that either promote codon-specific hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA (class I) or lack specificity but stimulate the dissociation of class I factors from the ribosome (class II). One human mitochondrial protein has been previously identified in silico as a putative member of the class I release factors. Although we could not confirm the function of this factor, we report the identification of a different mitochondrial protein, mtRF1a, that is capable in vitro and in vivo of terminating translation at UAA/UAG codons. Further, mtRF1a depletion in HeLa cells led to compromised growth in galactose and increased production of reactive oxygen species.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A central mitochondrial function is that of oxidative phosphorylation, the process of coupling respiration to ATP production. Thirteen of the polypeptides critical for this function are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Mitochondrial protein synthesis is therefore central to the life of aerobic eukaryotic cells; however, our understanding of mammalian mitochondrial gene expression is far from complete, particularly concerning the mechanisms governing mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is essential that we redress this situation, as it has become increasingly clear that defects of mitochondrial translation constitute an important subset of mitochondrial disorders (<xref rid="bib11 bib20 bib25 bib36 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Coenen et al., 2004; Jacobs and Turnbull, 2005; Miller et al., 2004; Smeitink et al., 2006; Valente et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mitochondrial translation apparatus employs a different codon usage from the universal code, with some species decoding AUA as methionine and the majority converting the universal STOP codon UGA into a tryptophan. Thus, most mitochondrial translation systems have reduced the number of termination codons from three to two (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Elzanowski and Ostell, 2000</xref>). Although the human mitochondrial code also employs these two changes, it varies still further by commandeering two additional termination codons, AGA and AGG, that would conventionally encode arginine (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barrell et al., 1979</xref>). Once the translation complex has reached a termination codon, the completed protein must be dissociated from the final tRNA, the ribosome, and its cognate mRNA. The proteins responsible for fulfilling these functions are the release factors (RFs), of which there are two classes (for review, see <xref rid="bib21 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kisselev et al., 2003; Poole and Tate, 2000</xref>). Class I is codon specific with peptide motifs that distinguish the STOP codons. In prokaryotic RFs, this is an SPF or PXT tripeptide motif (<xref rid="bib19 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2000; Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). There is also a GGQ loop/motif facilitating the termination of translation by hydrolysis of the ester bond between the tRNA and the nascent polypeptide (<xref rid="bib15 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et al., 1999; Seit-Nebi et al., 2001</xref>). Eubacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic release factors differ in their class I constituents. Eubacteria utilize three STOP codons and require two release factors, RF1 and RF2. Both recognize UAA, but RF1 also interacts with UAG and RF2 with UGA. Thus, although each bacterial RF recognizes a pair of STOP codons, both are necessary for appropriate translation termination of the entire mRNA population. Most eukaryota and archaebacteria utilize the same three stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA), but each organism requires only a single omnipotent protein, named eRF1 or aRF1, respectively, that can recognize all three STOP triplets (<xref rid="bib15 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et al., 1999; Konecki et al., 1977</xref>). This leaves the intriguing question of whether human mitochondria resemble more closely the eukaryota and archaebacteria and have evolved a single release factor that can recognize all four codons that are used, or whether they follow the eubacterial paradigm of two RFs, each recognizing a pair of stop codons, which would more closely reflect their α-proteobacterial origins.</p>
      <p>Thus far, no human mitochondrial release factor has been characterized. A candidate, mtRF1, was proposed several years ago from bioinformatic analyses (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>) and has since been assimilated into the scientific literature (for example, <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib6 bib8 bib16 bib21 bib29 bib31 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Antonicka et al., 2006; Askarian-Amiri et al., 2000; Bulygin et al., 2002; Chavatte et al., 2003; Frolova et al., 2002; Kisselev et al., 2003; Oparina et al., 2005; Petry et al., 2005; Smeitink et al., 2006</xref>). Class I release factors of the RF1 type contain a PXT tripeptide motif responsible for codon recognition. Human mtRF1, however, exhibits a hexapeptide PEVGLS across this region.</p>
      <p>Here we report that we have now identified an alternative gene product with greater similarity across the tripeptide recognition motif of the bacterial RF1. Moreover, we ascribe mitochondrial localization and release activity to this protein, mtRF1a, which exhibits specific recognition of the main codons used, UAA and UAG, consistent with it being a release factor in human mitochondria.</p>

        <title>Human mtRF1 Is a Mitochondrial Protein</title>
        <p>A number of papers now state that human mitochondria have a single release factor, mtRF1, which was identified <italic>in silico</italic> a number of years ago (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>). To identify whether this protein is indeed mitochondrial, we generated a GFP fusion construct C-terminal to the predicted mtRF1 N-terminal targeting sequence. HeLa cells were transiently transfected and after 24 hr were treated with mitotracker-CMH<sub>2</sub>X ROS to visualize the mitochondria. Concordance of the fluorescence signals indicated mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Does Human mtRF1 Function as a Release Factor?</title>
        <p>To assess whether mtRF1 could function as a release factor, we adopted an in vitro and an in vivo approach. In vitro release factor assays were performed essentially as established by Caskey and colleagues (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et al., 1971</xref>). Briefly, ribosomes were incubated with AUG synthetic triplet and f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> to load the ribosomal P site prior to addition of purified mtRF1 and the synthetic stop codon to be assessed. Free f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met was then quantified to indicate release activity. The exact size of the N-terminal presequence that might be cleaved from the full-length protein upon mitochondrial import is unknown, and predictions from targeting programmes vary from 17 up to 70 residues. Moreover, sequence alignment indicates that the first 63 amino acids of the mtRF1 N-terminal extension do not align with the bacterial RF1. Therefore, to simulate possible mature polypeptides without the loss of recognized functional domains, two proteins carrying N-terminal truncations and increased solubility, mtRF1Δ49 and mtRF1Δ69 (data not shown), were purified. These were tested against the universal and mitochondrial-specific stop codons, but no activity could be detected with UAA, AGA, or AGG codons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>For in vivo studies, we assessed whether human mtRF1 could suppress the phenotype caused by loss of the endogenous release factor from yeast. Mutations of <italic>S. cerevisiae MRF1</italic> cause a respiratory dysfunction associated with the loss of intact mtDNA (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pel et al., 1992</xref>). Such mtDNA instability is known to result from defects in the general mitochondrial translation machinery (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 1985</xref>). Expression of the entire human <italic>mtRF1</italic> cDNA in a heterozygous Δ<italic>mrf1 rho<sup>+</sup></italic> diploid, followed by sporulation, did not yield any <italic>Δmrf1</italic> spores that could grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (glycerol, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Similarly, there was no restoration of cytochrome spectra, consistent with a lack of mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory complex assembly (data not shown). In fact, the <italic>Δmrf1</italic> spores producing human mtRF1 could still not maintain their mtDNA. This raised the possibility that complementation occurred but was too weak to allow mtDNA maintenance, thus preventing nonfermentable growth. To address this problem, a new <italic>mrf1</italic>-deleted strain was engineered in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a <italic>petite</italic>-negative yeast, for which mtDNA loss events are highly counterselected. The Δ<italic>mrf1Sp</italic> strain showed reduced growth at 28°C on galactose, which forces respiration, and it stopped growing at 36°C on the same medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online) but retained mtDNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). Transfectants of this strain expressing the cDNA encoding human mtRF1 were also unable to respire, and there was no restoration of growth on glycerol/ethanol or galactose, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, despite the presence of an intact mtDNA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Identification of an Alternative Candidate Human Mitochondrial Release Factor</title>
        <p>The lack of release activity in vitro could have been due to the necessity to use the heterologous bacterial 70S ribosomes rather than 55S mitoribosomes. To date, it has not been possible to establish a reproducible in vitro assay with mammalian mitoribosomes, unlike with yeast components (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Askarian-Amiri et al., 2000</xref>), perhaps explained by recent cryo-electron microscopy studies, which have revealed that isolated mammalian mitoribosomes retain deacylated mt-tRNA in the P site (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2003</xref>). Second, the failure of mtRF1 to restore respiration in either of the yeast Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> strains may be explained by yeast Mrf1p recognizing only UAA/UAG as termination codons (as all yeast mt-mRNAs contain UAA or UAG as stop codons), while those recognized by the human mtRF1 could potentially be AGG and AGA. If this is the case, then there may be a second human mitochondrial release factor. Searching of the human databases revealed a second candidate that we will call mtRF1a (UniprotKB/TrEMBL Q96EX4). This predicted polypeptide of 380 amino acids shows an overall sequence identity of approximately 42% with mtRF1, 34% with yeast mRFs (<italic>S. pombe</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>K. lactis</italic>), 40% with bacterial RF1s, and 41% similarity to the RF from a close evolutionary relative <italic>R. prowazeckii</italic> (<xref rid="bib2 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et al., 1998; Gray, 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, mtRF1a contains a PXT motif that more closely resembles other RF1s, containing the triamino acid recognition motif PKT, rather than the hexapeptide sequence in mtRF1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>As with mtRF1, a C-terminal GFP fusion protein construct was generated for mtRF1a and transiently transfected into HeLa cells before staining with mitotracker after 24 hr. Mitochondrial targeting was shown by colocalization of the fluorescence signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). To confirm intramitochondrial uptake, import experiments were performed with in vitro-translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled mtRF1a and isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). Import was shown to be dependent on a mitochondrial membrane potential (FCCP, lanes 4 and 5) and resulted in cleavage of the presequence (lanes 2 and 3). The matured protein was resistant to added Proteinase K, confirming mitochondrial uptake (lane 3).</p>
        <p>Any factor involved in mitochondrial protein translation would be predicted to be present in all cell types. Antisera were raised against purified recombinant mtRF1a and affinity purified. Mitochondrial protein isolated from human skeletal muscle and a variety of human cell lines were analyzed by western analysis, and mtRF1a was found to be ubiquitous (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Further, by comparison of HeLa extracts against a standard curve of purified mtRF1a, we were able to calculate approximately 30,000 molecules per cell (data not shown).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>Human mtRF1a Is a Translation Release Factor</title>
        <p>Purified recombinant mtRF1a was tested in the termination assay described above. Initial assays showed release of f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met when either UAA or UAG was used as a synthetic stop codon, confirming that mtRF1a could function as a release factor. Assay conditions were optimized for the human mitochondrial release factor (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). Using these assay parameters, the human recombinant mtRF1a was interrogated with a full panel of codons. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D clearly demonstrates that mtRF1a mediated codon-specific release of f[<sup>3</sup>H]Met from the termination complex. There is significant recognition of UAA and UAG stop codons by human mtRF1a but only residual noncatalytic levels comparable to those obtained when no codon was present for the noncognate stops AGA and AGG. Crucially, the UGA codon, encoding tryptophan in the human mitochondrion, did not stimulate release activity. Elongating the stop codon 3′ to include three further adenosine residues to mimic the context with the poly(A) tail made no significant change to the release activity observed.</p>
        <p>Although the human mtDNA utilizes four triplet sequences as stop signals, the usage is not evenly distributed at the end of the 13 mitochondrial open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1981</xref>). The noncanonical AGA and AGG stops are used only once each, for <italic>MTCOI</italic> and by <italic>MTND6</italic>, respectively. Of the remaining 11 ORFs, <italic>MTCO2</italic> and <italic>MTATP8</italic> employ UAG as stop codons, and the final nine all use UAA encoded directly by the genome or completed by the addition of a poly(A) tail. Thus, 11 of the 13 transcripts utilize stop signals recognized by human mtRF1a.</p>
        <p>In vivo analyses were performed concomitantly. Complementation by human mtRF1a was assessed in both Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> yeast strains as described for mtRF1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Western blots of cell fractions confirmed the mitochondrial localization of the human protein in yeast, albeit at different level to wild-type. Whereas only a faint mtRF1a signal was detected in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria, a strong signal was obtained in <italic>S. pombe</italic> mitochondria, with a small fraction of protein being detected in the postmitochondrial fraction, suggesting that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> the human protein was either better expressed, more stable, and/or more efficiently imported into mitochondria (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A). In contrast to expression of mtRF1, the presence of human mtRF1a was sufficient to stably maintain mtDNA in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> strain (data not shown) and restore growth on respiratory substrates for both yeasts (glycerol for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; galactose and glycerol at 28°C for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; and 36°C on galactose for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B), consistent with the observed increase in cytochromes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B, right-hand panels) and partial restoration of steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins (Cox2, Cyt <italic>b</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Mitochondrial translation in several <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains was also monitored by in vivo <sup>35</sup>S labeling of mitochondrial proteins. No de novo synthesis was detected in the deletion mutant. In contrast, the isogenic strain producing the wild-type yeast Mrf1p exhibited high levels of protein synthesis. Production of the human mtRF1a also resulted in mitochondrial translation, albeit at decreased levels when compared to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). These data confirm that mtRF1a can function to restore translation in yeast strains deficient in endogenous mitochondrial translation termination factors.</p>

        <title>Depletion of Human mtRF1a Causes a Growth Phenotype</title>
        <p>To determine the role of human mtRF1a in the mitochondrion, siRNA was used to deplete the factor in HeLa cells. Three siRNA molecules were designed to different positions of the mtRF1a transcript, and each was shown to decrease the steady-state level of the release factor by more than 75% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Crude analysis of cell proliferation revealed lower levels of confluency when cells were monitored for 6 days with each siRNA independently (data not shown). As the three siRNA duplexes gave a similar phenotype, all subsequent experiments were performed with siRNA 2 alone. Detailed cell counts were then performed for siRNA2- or nontargeted siRNA-treated HeLa cells cultured in standard DMEM-promoting glycolysis or glucose-free media supplemented with galactose to force dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. As can be seen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), the siRNA2-treated cells showed an increase in population doubling time, which was particularly marked when cells were forced to respire in the galactose media.</p>

        <title>Depletion of mtRF1a Does Not Affect the Steady-State Levels of Mitochondrially Encoded RNA or Protein</title>
        <p>To explore the exact mechanism causing this phenotype, we analyzed mitochondrially encoded RNA and protein. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows that the steady states of the mitochondrially encoded members of the OXPHOS complexes I (ND6) and IV (COXI and COXII) were virtually unaffected after 3 or 6 days of siRNA-mediated mtRF1a knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). This was consistent with the absence of any effect on de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). One corollary was that nascent polypeptides remained associated with ribosomes, affecting the assembly of the nascent polypeptide into OXPHOS complexes. Thus, to assess the levels of fully assembled complexes, Blue Native PAGE was employed. After separation of intact complexes, no apparent difference was seen in the steady-state level or migration of these multisubunit enzymes (complexes I, III, and IV, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting that nascent peptides are eventually released from the ribosome.</p>
        <p>Although the levels of OXPHOS complexes were similar, it was possible that electron transfer rates or coupling to ATP synthesis was affected, causing the growth phenotype. Polarographic analysis of control and siRNA-treated cells was performed, and results are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D. No significant differences in coupled or uncoupled rates of electron transfer were found, and the respiratory control ratios were comparable between samples, again consistent with release of the nascent and assembled polypeptide from the ribosome.</p>
        <p>Critically, a previous report has demonstrated that loss of an mt-mRNA termination codon does not prevent protein synthesis, complex formation, or activity (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it appears that neither loss of the termination codon nor depletion of the release factor has an effect on the steady-state or de novo synthesis of human mitochondrial proteins. In those transcripts lacking termination codons, there was marked translation-dependent degradation of the poly(A) tail and rapid turnover (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et al., 2003</xref>). Northern analysis (data not shown) and MPAT assays on <italic>MTCO1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>MTND1</italic>, <italic>3</italic> transcripts, however, confirmed that depletion of mtRF1a caused no effect on mt-mRNA stability or poly(A) tail length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E).</p>

        <title>Depletion of mtRF1a Causes Increased Mitochondrial ROS Production, Mitochondrial Mass, and mtDNA Copy Number</title>
        <p>The role of a release factor is to promote hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the nascent peptide to the terminal tRNA. Hydrolysis can occur independent of the factor, which would potentially make the release factor redundant, but this noncatalytic rate is believed to be relatively slow (W.T., unpublished data). Moreover, peptidyl-tRNA can also “drop off” the ribosome (reviewed in <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Das and Varshney, 2006</xref>), and a recent report of a human mitochondrial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, PTH2 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">De Pereda et al., 2004</xref>), suggests this enzyme would hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA complex, allowing the recycling of the tRNA. It is therefore difficult to predict the exact defect that would occur on depletion of the factor in human mitochondria. Our initial data showed that a growth phenotype was apparent, but this was not due to any dramatic effect on mt-mRNA stability, protein synthesis, OXPHOS complex assembly, or function. If, however, newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins are not being perfectly assembled, the activity of some OXPHOS complexes may be subtly compromised, resulting in electron escape during the natural electron transfer and generating increased reactive oxygen species. Superoxide and peroxide production in the mitochondria were therefore measured with mitoSOX and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), respectively, at day 3 of siRNA-mediated mtRF1a depletion. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B shows a significant increase of these levels over control, which was maintained through to day 6 (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Increased ROS has recently been implicated as a messenger for increased mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Loshuertos et al., 2006</xref>). Levels of mitochondrial cardiolipin (quantified using NAO) and mtDNA copy number were assessed as a measure of increased mitochondrial bulk/mass. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B, a significant increase was also noted using both methods, consistent with mtRF1a depletion causing an increase in mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial mass. To use mtDNA copy number per cell as an indicator of mitochondrial mass, DNA was isolated from HeLa cells following exposure to the nontargeting and mtRF1a-directed siRNAs and real-time PCR employed to quantify mtDNA (ND1) relative to nuclear DNA (18S rDNA) (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>). After depletion of mtRF1a by siRNA, there was a relative 2.2-fold increase in the mtDNA levels compared to untreated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B, mt/nuc), consistent with the 1.6-fold increase identified with NAO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B, NAO).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report the characterization of a human mitochondrial translation release factor, mtRF1a, based on the following criteria: (1) sequence similarity to known release factors; (2) mitochondrial localization, import, and cleavage of the preprotein; (3) presence in mitochondria of all cell types and tissues tested; (4) demonstration of release factor activity in vitro with <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes; (5) rescue of the Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> respiratory deficiency in fission and budding yeast in vivo; and (6) demonstration of a growth phenotype in mtRF1a-depleted human cells. Scrutiny of the primary structure of mtRF1a reveals similarities to the many other release factor sequences retaining the classic GGQ tripeptide of the peptidyl-tRNA interaction site in the M domain (<xref rid="bib15 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Frolova et al., 1999; Song et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). There is greater similarity to the eubacterial RF1-type factors than to the omnipotent eRF1, consistent with this protein recognizing only UAA and UAG codons. Human mtRF1a showed no activity with UGA as codon. There are two class I release factors in most prokaryotes. Both are able to decode UAA, while UAG and UGA are recognized by only RF1 or RF2, respectively. It has previously been shown that the basis of this sequence discrimination is due to a tripeptide sequence in a structurally similar region, PXT in RF1 types or SPF for RF2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2000</xref>). MtRF1a carries PKT at position 206–208, rather than the hexapeptide found in mtRF1, consistent with this being an RF1-type release factor, terminating protein synthesis at UAA and UAG codons.</p>
      <p>Is mtRF1 a mitochondrial release factor? The identification of mtRF1 was skillfully made through bioinformatic mining of an EST database but without any data to support either localization or function (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Spremulli, 1998</xref>). We have now shown that both mtRF1 and mtRF1a are localized to mitochondria, but only mtRF1a was capable of decoding UAA/UAG codons in our assays. Furthermore, addition of mtRF1 to release assays programmed either with mtRF1a or <italic>E. coli</italic> RF1 failed to compete for the ribosomal A site when UAG/UAA were present, suggesting that mtRF1 was unable to recognize these codons (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). Although for mtRF1 neither detectable in vitro release activity nor suppression of a respiratory deficiency of the yeast Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> was observed, we hypothesize that it is indeed a mitochondrial release factor and is responsible for decoding the noncognate stop codons AGG and AGA. The absence of release activity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes may be due to the imposed use of a heterologous assay system, as the <italic>E. coli</italic> system does not naturally terminate with either codon. Sequence comparisons provide a compelling case for this hypothesis, since it contains the GGQ domain, has strong sequence similarity to other RF1-type proteins, and has a three residue extension immediately C-terminal to the PXT domain that is absent in all comparators (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that may underlie AGA/AGG decoding. Further, since yeast exclusively use UAA/UAG as stop codons, this could explain the lack of observed complementation in vivo.</p>
      <p>In vivo and in vitro studies showed that mtRF1a does possess release factor activity. Expression in yeast strains devoid of their endogenous release factor restored mitochondrial translation, indicating ability to decode UAA/UAG, while depletion in human cells led to a growth phenotype and elevated ROS production. How might the loss of mtRF1a lead to increased ROS? The major source of cellular ROS is the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, in particular at the sites of electron transfer to and from respiratory complexes I and III. All 13 polypeptides encoded by the human mtDNA are members of four of the five complexes that couple oxidative phosphorylation. These complexes contain many polypeptides imported from the cytosol and integrated together with the mitochondrially encoded proteins in a complicated and incompletely understood process of assembly. The 13 mitochondrial polypeptides are highly hydrophobic, being putatively translated at the membrane surface and nursed by the membrane protein Oxa1 that aids in the assembly process (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Spremulli, 2000</xref>). In the absence of translation termination, nascent proteins will be inserted into the membrane but will also still be attached to the ribosome via the P site bound peptidyl-tRNA. It is understood that this ester bond can be spontaneously hydrolyzed over time, but release factor activity at the ribosome dramatically accelerates this natural process (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schmeing et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is possible that subtle temporal effects on the assembly process following siRNA-mediated knockdown may lead to assembled complexes with minor defects in electron transfer, leading to increased loss of electrons in the form of ROS. A similar situation has recently been reported for <italic>trans</italic>-mitochondrial murine cybrids, in which the same mtDNA polymorphism in different nuclear backgrounds led to modulations in ROS production and mitochondrial cell mass without any dramatic effect on OXPHOS complex activities (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Loshuertos et al., 2006</xref>). A second possibility, that we have discounted, is that the ribosome might stall at the termination site and in the absence of a release factor shift-reading frame, leading to C-terminal extensions mainly of polylysine due to the proximity of the poly(A) tail. First, in the only characterization of a human mt-mRNA lacking a termination codon, the mt-mRNA was rapidly degraded following translation, probably due to the translating ribosome pushing away the natural poly(A)-associated protein(s) leaving naked RNA prone to RNase digestion (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et al., 2003</xref>). In the study presented here, there is no evidence of decreased mt-mRNA stability. Second, although only short polylysine extensions would be predicted to be added to most mitochondrial polypeptides, ATPase 8, in contrast, would increase substantially in size, as it is translated from the 5′ part of the bicistronic <italic>RNA14</italic>. Following depletion of mtRF1a, there is no evidence of increased size in this or any newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins. Third, when we have used an antibody specific to polylysine, we do not see any new mitochondrial products (data not shown).</p>
      <p>In summary, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a human mitochondrial translation release factor, mtRF1a, that decodes the major stop codons UAA and UAG. This should now be included in the growing list of mitochondrial translation factors, mutations of which could underlie the mitochondrial dysfunction in an increasing number of patients for whom nuclear-encoded mutations have yet to be determined.</p>

      <p>We would like to thank Linda Spremulli (North Carolina) for providing initial constructs; P. Belenguer, G. Dujardin, T. Fox, C. Lemaire, and J. Velours for yeast strains or antibodies; L. He for assistance with the mtDNA copy number estimation; and T. Edgar for invaluable training in the release factor assays. G. Vinatier and K. Vasileiadou participated to the initial stages of the yeast work. I.K., M.G., and N.B. are supported by the Association Française contre les Myopathies and by Agence Nationale de la Recherche grant JCJC06-136672. The Iranian Government provided support (for H.R.S.-L.). J.R. and M.W. were funded by EC-MCEST (contract MEST-CT-FP6-503684). R.L. and Z.C.-L. wish to acknowledge the Wellcome Trust for continuing support.</p>

        <p>Human mtRF1 Is a Mitochondrial Protein with No Detectable Release Factor Activity</p>
        <p>(A) Human mtRF1 is targeted to mitochondria. HeLa cells were transiently transfected for 24 hr with a construct expressing 290 N-terminal residues of mtRF1 fused to GFP. Cells were also stained to visualize mitochondria (mitotracker CMH<sub>2</sub>X-Ros) and nuclei (DAPI). Fluorescence images were captured and mitochondrial colocalization of the fusion protein confirmed by superimposition of the green and red signals in a linescan of the image (line visible in upper panel). An image typical of the three independent transfections is shown.</p>
        <p>(B) Purified mtRF1 does not induce translation termination in vitro. Human mtRF1 lacking the N-terminal 49 residues was purified and used to assess translation termination from 5 pmol ribosomes programmed with the synthetic codon (400 pmol) indicated. Release factor activity was measured by the hydrolysis of f[<sup>3</sup>H]met from its cognate tRNA<sup>Met</sup> as detailed in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>. Nonlimiting amounts of both <italic>E. coli</italic> RF1 (50 pmol) and UAA triplet (400 pmol) were used in tandem as a positive control for the assay. Standard errors were calculated from a minimum of eight repeats.</p>
        <p>(C) Human mtRF1 fails to restore respiratory competence in <italic>S. cerevisiae Δmrf1</italic>. Diploids producing human mtRF1 or containing vector alone were generated from the <italic>Δmrf1</italic> strain crossed to the wild-type CW252/A. Following sporulation, asci were dissected and resultant haploid sister spores (A–D) assessed for presence of the plasmid (−uracil), resistance to geneticin G418 showing deletion of <italic>MRF1Sc</italic>, and growth on a nonfermentable carbon source (glycerol).</p>
        <p>(D) Human mtRF1 fails to restore respiratory competence in <italic>S. pombe Δmrf1</italic>. The new fission yeast strain devoid of endogenous mitochondrial release factor NB329 (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) and its isogenic wild-type strain NB205-6A were transformed with either empty vector or one producing human mtRF1. Transformants were patched on uracil-free minimal medium selecting for the plasmid, replicated onto complete galactose or glycerol plates, and incubated at 28°C.</p>

        <p>Human mtRF1a Is a Mitochondrial Release Factor that Recognizes UAA and UAG Codons</p>
        <p>(A) Human mtRF1a is targeted to mitochondria. HeLa cells were transiently transfected (24 hr) with a construct expressing 357 N-terminal residues of mtRF1a fused to GFP. Cells were also stained to visualize mitochondria (mitotracker CMH<sub>2</sub>X-Ros) and nuclei (DAPI). Fluorescence images were captured and mitochondrial colocalization of the fusion protein confirmed by superimposition of the green (fusion protein) and red (mitochondrial) signals as shown in the far right panel. The image shown is representative of three independent repeats.</p>
        <p>(B) Human mtRF1a is imported into mitochondria and matured. Full-length <sup>35</sup>S-radiolabeled mtRF1a was in vitro synthesized (lane 1) and incubated with rat liver mitochondria. Under import conditions, two products are visible, the full-length preprotein and the mature protein (lane 2). Components (FCCP, Proteinase K) were added as indicated.</p>
        <p>(C) Human mtRF1a is found in the mitochondria of all cell lines and tissues analyzed. Human Hep G2, HEK293, and HeLa cell (C60 μg) or mitochondrial (M20 μg) lysates along with human skeletal muscle mitochondria (SkM–M18 μg) were prepared and subjected to western blot analysis with anti-mtRF1a antibodies. A single protein of approximately 40 kDa was visible in all cell/tissue types tested and found exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction (not in postmitochondrial supernatants, data not shown). No crossreactivity was noted with purified mtRF1 (data not shown).</p>
        <p>(D) Human mtRF1a has release factor activity with UAA and UAG, but not UGA codons. Release assays were performed with 50 pmol mtRF1a and 5 pmol ribosomes, as detailed in the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. Ribosomes were programmed independently with five triplet codons (400 pmol), four of which are termination codons in human mitochondria (UAA/G, AGA/G), and UGA that encodes tryptophan in mitochondria but acts as a termination codon in the cytosol. No codon controls were also performed. Standard errors were calculated from a minimum of three or a maximum of 11 repeats.</p>

        <p>(A) Human mtRF1a restores respiratory growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacking a mitochondrial release factor. The heterozygous Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> diploid strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) was transfected with empty vector or encoding human mtRF1a prior to sporulation and tetrad analysis as described.

        <p>(B) Human mtRF1a can function in fission yeast mitochondria. The <italic>Δmrf1Sp</italic> strain NB329 or the isogenic wild-type was transformed with either control vector or one producing mtRF1a. Transformants patched on uracil-free medium were replicated onto galactose or glycerol/ethanol medium and incubated at 28°C.

The right panel shows total cell extracts of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Δ<italic>mrf1</italic> strain transformed with either the empty vector (lane 1), or plasmids producing the human mtRF1a (lane 2) or Mrf1Sp (lane 3) proteins, and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies recognizing the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cox2 or human Hsp60 protein as a loading control.</p>
        <p>(D) Mitochondrial translation is restored in the presence of human mtRF1a. This was measured with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine incorporation as detailed in the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. Strains were as follows: lane 1, Δ<italic>mrf1Sc</italic> NB345 + vector encoding human mtRF1a; lane 2, Δ<italic>mrf1Sc</italic> NB345 + empty vector; lane 3, WT NB346 + empty vector.</p>

        <p>Depletion of Human mtRF1a Does Not Grossly Affect Human Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis</p>
        <p>(A) Steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins are unaffected by depletion of mtRF1a. HeLa cells were exposed to siRNA molecules targeting three different regions of the mtRF1a-encoding mRNA sequence (lanes 1–3) or to an untargeted siRNA (siRNA-N, lane 4) for 6 days, and cell lysates (30 μg) were prepared. Control lysates were made from oligofectamine alone (lane 5) and untreated cells (Con, lane 6). Western blots were performed with antibodies against mitochondrial translation products (COX1 cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit 1; COX2, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit II; ND6 NADH CoQ oxidoreductase subunit 6). Porin was used as a nuclear encoded control to confirm equal loading. Purified mtRF1a (5 ng) is loaded in lane 7. The anti-mtRF1a experiment was overexposed to show the level of depletion. The blot accurately reflects three independent experiments.</p>
        <p>(B) De novo synthesis of mitochondrial proteins is unaffected by depletion of mtRF1a. Cytosolic protein synthesis of HeLa cells grown in the presence of siRNA targeted to <italic>MTRF1a</italic> (siRNA2-mtRF1a) or untargeted (siRNA-N) for 4 days was inhibited by the addition of emetine, allowing the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled met/cys directly into the 13 de novo-synthesized mitochondrial proteins. Equal amounts of total cell protein (20 μg) were separated through a 15% SDS PAG and exposed to a PhosphorImager as described. Polypeptides were designated based on their mobilities as described in <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chomyn (1996)</xref>.</p>
        <p>(C) OXPHOS complexes are present at normal steady-state levels in cells depleted of mtRF1a. HeLa cells were exposed to mtRF1a targeted (lane 1) or untargeted (lane 2) siRNA for 6 days prior to digitonin permeabilisation and preparation for BN-PAGE as described. Following separation, complexes were identified using antisera as detailed. Complex I, anti-39kDa antibody; complex II, anti-SDH 70 kDa antibody; complex III, anti-core 2 antibody; complex IV, anti-COX1 antibody.</p>
        <p>(D) Respiratory coupling is unaffected in cells depleted of human mtRF1a. HeLa cells (1–2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) grown in targeted (siRNA2-mtRF1a) and untargeted (siRNA-N) siRNA for 3 days were subjected to high-resolution respirometry as detailed. Standard errors were calculated from three measures of respiratory control and capacity. UCR compares the fully uncoupled and resting respiratory rates to give an indication of the respiratory reserve and RCR compares the fully uncoupled respiratory rates to the oligomycin inhibited state 4 respiratory rate, while RCRp combines these ratios to indicate the level of phosphorylation-related respiratory capacity.</p>
        <p>(E) The poly(A) tail of mitochondrial mRNA is unaffected by depletion of mtRF1a. RNA was isolated from HeLa cells depleted of mtRF1a (lanes 1, siRNA1; lanes 2, siRNA2; lanes 3, siRNA3) and untargeted control siRNA treated (lanes 4) before the poly(A) tail length was assessed for several mt-mRNAs as previously described (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Temperley et al., 2003</xref>). Poly(A) profiles are shown for transcripts <italic>MTCOI</italic>, <italic>MTCOII</italic>, <italic>MTND1</italic>, and <italic>MTND3</italic>.</p>

        <p>Depletion of mtRF1a Causes a Growth Defect, Increased Mitochondrial ROS Production, and Mitochondrial Mass</p>
        <p>(A) Cell growth is compromised by depletion of mtRF1a. Multiple aliquots of HeLa cells were exposed to targeted (siRNA2-mtRF1a) and nontargeted (siRNA-N) interfering RNAs for up to 6 days in glucose (promoting glycolysis) or galactose (forcing oxidative respiration) media with cell counts performed each day. Cell numbers are presented in a semi-log plot. The numbers represent a mean ± SEM from four independent wells.</p>
        <p>(B) Superoxide levels and mitochondrial mass are elevated in cells depleted of mtRF1a. HeLa cells were exposed to targeted (white) and nontargeted (black) siRNA. Superoxide (SOX) was measured with MitoSOX probes and peroxide (DHR) with dihydrorhodamine 123. Levels were measured at day 3 and compared to levels in untreated control cells. The fold increase is shown as a mean ± SEM from at least three independent experiments (p &lt; 0.01 comparing nontargeted to targeted values for mitoSOX and DHR). Mitochondrial mass per cell was measured with the cardiolipin selective dye, NAO. Changes in mtDNA content relative to the nuclear DNA were calculated by qPCR of the <italic>MTND1</italic> and 18S rDNA genes and were normalized to untreated cells.</p>
