        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Despite much progress in understanding the folding and the aggregation processes of proteins, the rules defining their interplay have yet to be fully defined. This problem is of particular importance since many diseases are initiated by protein unfolding and hence the propensity to aggregate competes with intramolecular collapse and other folding events. Here, we describe the roles of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in defining the length of the lag time and the apparent rate of elongation of the 100-residue protein human β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin at pH 2.5, commencing from an acid-denatured state that lacks persistent structure but contains significant non-random hydrophobic interactions. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, quantitative kinetic analysis and computational methods, we show that only a single region of about 10 residues in length, determines the rate of fibril formation, despite the fact that other regions exhibit a significant intrinsic propensity for aggregation. We rationalise these results by analysing the effect of incorporating the conformational properties of acid-unfolded β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin and its variants at pH 2.5 as measured by NMR spectroscopy into the Zyggregator aggregation prediction algorithm. These results demonstrate that residual structure in the precursor state modulates the intrinsic propensity of the polypeptide chain to aggregate and that the algorithm developed here allows the key regions for aggregation to be more clearly identified and the rates of their self-association to be predicted. Given the common propensity of unfolded chains to form non-random intramolecular interactions as monomers and to self-assemble subsequently into amyloid fibrils, the approach developed should find widespread utility for the prediction of regions important in amyloid formation and their rates of self-assembly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A wide range of highly debilitating diseases are associated with the failure of proteins to maintain their native structures and remain soluble—an abnormal behaviour that results in their aggregation into fibrillar assemblies.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> These amyloid fibrils exhibit a common cross-β structure<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> despite the lack of sequence and structural similarities between their precursor proteins.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It has been suggested that the ability to form the characteristic cross-β structure of amyloid is an inherent latent property of polypeptide chains, as many proteins not known to be involved in disease can produce amyloid-like fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic> under appropriate conditions.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Therefore, studying the determinants of fibril formation using model systems can provide important insights into how proteins assemble into the amyloid fold, with applications for understanding both advantageous<xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,5</sup></xref> and deleterious<xref rid="bib1 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,6</sup></xref> consequences of this protein self-assembly process.</p>
      <p>Whilst insights into the atomic details of cross-β spines of peptides assembled into amyloid-like structures have been obtained,<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7–10</sup></xref> the molecular mechanisms of self-assembly into amyloid fibrils remain poorly understood. One aspect that has been clarified is that the same fundamental forces that lead to folding, which include hydrogen bonding as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, are also responsible for aggregation. Indeed, native states play a protective role by sequestering in their interior the most aggregation-prone regions of amino acid sequences.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> As a consequence, fibril formation may be inhibited by increasing the stability of the native state through mutational analysis or the addition of small molecules.<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> Conversely, therefore, the native state must be destabilised to allow intermolecular interactions that are favourable for aggregation to occur.<xref rid="bib11 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,14–18</sup></xref> Hence, even in the absence of folding to a native conformation, intramolecular interactions including fluctuating side chain–side chain interactions commonly associated with non-native collapsed states could play a role in modulating the aggregation propensity of a polypeptide chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a systematic analysis of the aggregation kinetics at low pH of β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m) and 30 mutational variants. Under these conditions, β<sub>2</sub>m forms fibrils with &gt; 90% yield and reproducible kinetics,<xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,20</sup></xref> commencing from a precursor that is unfolded but contains significant non-random structure involving two hydrophobic clusters stabilised by the native disulfide bond.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The results show that only a single region involving residues ∼ 60–70 in the full-length, 100-residue protein plays a major role in determining the kinetics of fibril formation, by contrast with some, but not all, predictions inferred from peptide studies<xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22–24</sup></xref> and numerical algorithms.<xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25–27</sup></xref> By taking into account the presence of non-random residual structure in the sequence of β<sub>2</sub>m at low pH provided by <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and its dependence on the protein sequence, we have developed an enhanced prediction method based on the physicochemical properties of the amino acid sequence<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> modulated by its propensity to form non-random intramolecular contacts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We show that this approach extends the model that we proposed previously for folded states<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> in providing an accurate description of the competition between intramolecular interactions and aggregation under non-native conditions. Application to the case of β<sub>2</sub>m at low pH demonstrates that this method accurately predicts the regions essential for amyloid formation and in controlling its rate. Given the generic propensity of unfolded chains to collapse and the prevalence of these structures in amyloid precursors of medical importance,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> the method developed should find widespread utility for the prediction of β-aggregation in other systems.</p>

        <title>Design of β<sub>2</sub>m variants</title>
        <p>Under native conditions, β<sub>2</sub>m forms a disulfide-bonded immunoglobulin fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a).<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> By contrast, at pH 2.5, β<sub>2</sub>m is denatured, forming a non-random collapsed state that lacks ordered secondary structure but contains two non-native hydrophobic clusters (residues 29–51 and 58–79) that are mutually interacting and stabilised by the native disulfide bond.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Under these conditions, β<sub>2</sub>m rapidly and spontaneously assembles into fibrils with the morphological, tinctorial, structural and kinetic characteristics of amyloid.<xref rid="bib20 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,33</sup></xref> Data collected under a variety of different experimental conditions suggest that β<sub>2</sub>m is highly amyloidogenic, with more than 60% of the sequence observed to form amyloid-like fibrils when created as peptide fragments<xref rid="bib7 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,22–24,29,30</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). The use of single point substitutions and chimeric proteins also suggested that numerous individual residues and/or regions of the protein are involved in fibril formation (see Ref. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> for a collated list of the mutations of β<sub>2</sub>m made to date). These results highlight the potential importance of much of the sequence of β<sub>2</sub>m for fibril formation. How this is modulated in the context of the intact protein, however, remains unknown. To address this question, a systematic mutagenesis study is required to resolve residue-specific details of the amyloidogenic determinants of β<sub>2</sub>m in the context of the full-length, oxidised protein under a single, identical set of experimental conditions.</p>
        <p>In an earlier study, we investigated the influence of just one region of β<sub>2</sub>m (residues 60–70, previously suggested as a highly amyloidogenic sequence<xref rid="bib22 bib26 bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,26,35</sup></xref>) in determining the rate of aggregation of the full-length protein.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Building on these results, we describe here a systematic analysis of the aggregation properties of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m and 30 variants that span its 100-residue sequence, including residues involved in all of the native β-strands or their interconnecting loops (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the majority of the variants created, hydrophobic residues were substituted with alanine. Additionally, the five prolines were individually substituted with glycine. Finally, two truncation variants were created: ΔN6, a species found in <italic>ex vivo</italic> deposits and known to have increased amyloid potential <italic>in vitro</italic>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and a novel variant, ΔC83, in which residues 84–99 were removed. The C-terminal 28 residues of β<sub>2</sub>m were shown to be highly amyloidogenic when created as a peptide fragment<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and to contain a region (residues 83–89) that determines the vastly different amyloid potentials of murine and human β<sub>2</sub>m.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Role of individual residues in the rates of fibril nucleation and elongation</title>
        <p>To assess the effect of each mutation on the kinetics of fibril formation, we monitored the length of the lag phase and the apparent rate of elongation using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence as a probe of fibrillogenesis, either in the presence or in the absence of fibril seeds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Conditions that enable reliable measurement of the rate of fibril formation over multiple samples recorded simultaneously were used (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Using this procedure, we determined the mean and variance of the lag time and apparent elongation rate of each variant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The kinetics of fibril formation of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m were recorded concurrently with each variant and used to normalise the data obtained. With the exception of the variant ΔC83, all proteins formed fibrils in unseeded reactions within 72 h, each resulting in fibrils that are morphologically indistinguishable by negative-stain electron microscopy from those formed from the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). Under different incubation conditions (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>), ΔC83 also formed long, straight fibrils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). The lag time of ΔC83 aggregation, therefore, was not compared directly with the other variants. The data nonetheless suggest that the presence of the C-terminal region is important, but not critical, in the initial stages of fibril formation. For the other mutant proteins, the effect of sequence variation on the lag time is dependent on the site of substitution and the type of modification introduced. In particular, five of the variants tested (H51A, F62A, Y63A, L65A and V82A) showed marked differences (&gt; 2- to 7-fold changes) in the average lag time compared with that of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m, whilst for the other 24 variants, the lag time was relatively unperturbed (resulting in ≤ 2-fold change in the lag time upon mutation) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). All the P to G variants showed little difference in lag time compared with wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m (&lt; 2-fold change) despite the fact that substitution of Pro with Gly probes the effects of altering both the main chain and side chain in determining aggregation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, L65A has the greatest effect on the lag time, whilst identical amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the sequence result in small (&lt; 2-fold) changes (e.g., compare the data for L65A with L87A) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The only variant to have a significantly shortened lag time compared with wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m was V82A. Why no other residue showed such behaviour is not clear: further substitutions would be needed to explore this further. Together, the data show that for this 100-residue protein, only residues 51, 62, 63 and 65 appear to be critically involved in determining the lag time of fibril formation, with other residues, including those in the C-terminal half of the polypeptide chain, playing a supporting role. This observation contrasts with the behaviour of peptide fragments, which suggested that three regions (residues 20–40, 60–70 and ∼ 80–100) are important for fibril formation<xref rid="bib7 bib22 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,22,29,30</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). Furthermore, the region of the protein containing His51 has not been observed to be prone to fibril formation as part of an isolated fragment, yet this residue appears to play a significant role in determining the length of the lag phase in the conditions tested. These results indicate that there are fundamental differences in aggregation potential of particular residues or certain sequences when isolated as peptides compared with their behaviour when included within the context of the full-length protein.</p>
        <p>Seeds formed by fragmenting fibrils prepared from the wild-type protein at pH 2.5 were next added to each reaction to determine the apparent elongation rate of each variant from a common template (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Under these conditions, highly reproducible kinetics ensue, allowing accurate determination of the apparent elongation rates<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and a more detailed comparison of the influence of different amino acid substitutions on the aggregation kinetics. All variants were able to extend seeds made from wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m, consistent with each variant assembling into a common fibrillar architecture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b). These experiments revealed that variants located predominantly in one region of the sequence (residues ∼ 60–70) reduce the apparent elongation rate with respect to the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c and d and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), highlighting the key role of this region in determining both the length of the lag time and the apparent rate of elongation. Three further variants, V27A, F56A and P72G, also affected the apparent elongation rate, suggesting that these residues are also important in the elongation process.</p>
        <p>The combined results from both sets of experimental data demonstrate the remarkable and unexpected result that only one region of contiguous amino acids (residues ∼ 60–70) within intact denatured β<sub>2</sub>m plays a pivotal role in determining the rate of fibril nucleation and elongation at low pH. This finding is in marked contrast with predictions of intrinsically amyloidogenic regions based on the physicochemical properties of the amino acid sequence<xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25–27</sup></xref> and experimental analyses using peptide fragments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). Akin to a protein folding reaction,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> therefore, the kinetics of fibril formation seem to be regulated by a few key residues, with the rest of the sequence providing a scaffold for encouraging profitable interactions.</p>

        <title>Non-random structure within denatured β<sub>2</sub>m modulates its aggregation propensity</title>
        <p>The ability to form fibrils is thought to be a common property of most polypeptide chains, as long as suitable environmental conditions are found.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Conditions that result in the exposure of the polypeptide chain to solvent thus reveal its inherent aggregation propensity, a property that is dependent on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the amino acids in the sequence.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> These properties have been used as a basis for the formulation of phenomenological models capable of predicting changes in aggregation propensity upon mutation, as well as the absolute rates of aggregation of peptides and unstructured polypeptide chains.<xref rid="bib26 bib27 bib35 bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27,35,38</sup></xref> Predictions of the aggregation-prone regions of β<sub>2</sub>m using TANGO, Aggrescan and Zyggregator<xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25–27</sup></xref> identified the regions ∼ 20–40 and ∼ 50–70 as having high intrinsic aggregation propensities (<xref rid="fig5 fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5 and 6a</xref>), albeit with differences in the magnitude of the aggregation propensity for each region. The prediction of residues ∼ 50–70 as the most aggregation-prone region is in agreement with the experimental data presented here (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and d and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and with those previously presented.<xref rid="bib19 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,22</sup></xref> Interestingly, of the six residues mutated in region 20–40 (F22A, V27A, F30A, P32G, V37A and L39A), a sequence that is predicted to have a high intrinsic aggregation propensity by two of the algorithms (Aggrescan and Zyggregator) (<xref rid="fig5 fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5 and 6a</xref>) and supported using peptide studies<xref rid="bib23 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,29</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b), only one mutation (V27A) caused a change (∼ 2-fold) in the apparent elongation rate, and none significantly affected the lag time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b and d). It is therefore important to understand why the intrinsic aggregation propensity is not by itself a good predictor of the tendency to aggregate for this region of β<sub>2</sub>m. In the case of fully folded proteins, we already demonstrated that regions that have a high intrinsic aggregation propensity might not play an important role in the aggregation process because they have also a high propensity to form intramolecular interactions in the native structure and, hence, be protected, at least in part, from giving rise to aggregation.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We therefore investigated here whether intramolecular interactions are also able to alter the intrinsic aggregation propensities under non-native conditions. In the case of β<sub>2</sub>m, the region comprising residues ∼ 20–40, which has an intrinsic aggregation propensity predicted by Zyggregator similar to that of residues ∼ 50–70 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a), not only contains significant non-native structure in the acid-denatured state of β<sub>2</sub>m<xref rid="bib19 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,21</sup></xref> but also contains Cys25, a residue that forms a disulfide bond with Cys80 that is essential both for the formation of a stable native structure and the generation of amyloid fibrils from full-length β<sub>2</sub>m.<xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39,40</sup></xref> Given that fragment 20–41 (known as the K3 peptide) has been shown to form long, straight amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions either in isolation<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> or when disulfide bonded to its complementary 76–91 fragment,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> the data suggest that this region is protected from aggregation by residual structure and/or the presence of a disulfide bond<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> in the acid-denatured state of the full-length protein.</p>
        <p>To further explore the hypothesis that non-random structure in the acid-unfolded state of β<sub>2</sub>m influences fibril formation, we compared the apparent rate of fibril elongation determined from seeded growth experiments with predictions derived using the Zyggregator algorithm modified to account for the low pH conditions<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig6 fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6a and 7a</xref>).

Additionally, variants F22A and I46A have similar experimental rates of elongation (∼ 1.68 h<sup>− 1</sup>), but are predicted to have <mml:math id="M2" altimg="si5.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>agg</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math>scores that differ substantially (1.25 and 1.32, respectively) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a, horizontal grey line). These data indicate that the prediction of intrinsic propensity for aggregation from the inherent properties of the constituent amino acids should be coupled to an assessment of the tendency to form intramolecular interactions to accurately define the aggregation properties of β<sub>2</sub>m at pH 2.5.</p>
        <p>As it has been observed by NMR measurements that acid-unfolded β<sub>2</sub>m contains significant non-random hydrophobic interactions,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> we hypothesised that these intramolecular interactions, in addition to the presence of the disulfide bond, could modulate the aggregation potential of the denatured chain. To account for this, we further generalised the Zyggregator algorithm to include the presence of intramolecular interactions, indicated by the magnitude of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values measured on a per-residue basis using NMR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>b and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). The use of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation data to account for the tendency to form intramolecular interactions in the low pH state of β<sub>2</sub>m is analogous to the use of protection factors from hydrogen exchange to rationalise the effects of the protection provided by the burial of the amyloidogenic regions in the native state described previously.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Modification of <mml:math id="M3" altimg="si6.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>agg</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math> by the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> value (termed <mml:math id="M4" altimg="si7.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>agg</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math>) also takes into account structural restraints dictated by the disulfide bond and allows the effect of specific amino acid substitutions on the intrinsic aggregation potential to be modulated by the conformational properties of the precursor state and its sensitivity to amino acid substitutions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c). For the analysis, we utilised a test set consisting of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m and 10 variants (I7A, F30A, L40F, L40R, F62A, Y66A, Y66E, Y66S, Y67A and F70A) (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) for which both the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values and the apparent elongation rates determined using seeded reactions (at 25 °C) were available (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Excluding the contribution of the NMR <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b), the correlation between the experimentally determined apparent elongation rates and those predicted using the low-pH, modified Zyggregator algorithm was not high (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.40) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b), indicating that the role of intramolecular interactions should be accounted for in order to perform accurate predictions. The incorporation of the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements for each variant (<xref rid="fig6 fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6c and 8</xref>) into the Zyggregator algorithm (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) results in a significant improvement in the correlation with the corresponding experimental values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.76) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c), although some of the rates in the ∼ 20–40 region are still overestimated (particularly for F30A), indicating that the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements used here provide only an approximate estimation of the role of intramolecular interactions in modulating the intrinsic aggregation propensities. In the case of native states, we were able to show that the tendency to form intramolecular interactions could be predicted directly from the sequence, without the need of measuring protection factors from hydrogen exchange.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> It could also be possible to estimate these tendencies in non-native states, thus avoiding the measurements of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation rates to perform the predictions of the overall aggregation propensities for different protein sequences. The results demonstrate that the residual structure in acid-denatured β<sub>2</sub>m is important in modulating the inherent aggregation propensity endowed by its amino acid sequence and that the ability of this structure to enhance or retard the observed aggregation rate is dependent upon the location of intramolecular interactions in the polypeptide chain. They also show how the inclusion of information describing these structural characteristics permits accurate prediction of the effect of even subtle mutations on the rate of fibril formation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results presented show that only one of the intrinsically aggregation-prone regions of β<sub>2</sub>m predicted using algorithms or peptide studies defines the aggregation potential of the complete polypeptide chain under the denaturing conditions that we have examined. This finding indicates that intramolecular and intermolecular interactions compete against each other to determine the overall aggregation process even in denatured proteins, so that the intrinsic propensities for aggregation and for forming soluble monomeric species modulate each other. Indeed, previous studies have implicated long-range intramolecular contacts involving the NAC region of α-synuclein in defining its aggregation properties,<xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42,43</sup></xref> whilst the presence of one particular hydrophobic cluster in denatured lysozyme at pH 2 has been shown to play a major role in preventing fibril formation.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> As we have demonstrated here, incorporation of the competing influences on collapse, folding and aggregation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) into prediction algorithms enables regions critical for aggregation to be identified in the context of full-length polypeptide sequences and the effects of subtle mutations to be quantified. Thus, whilst the intrinsic aggregation propensity can provide information as to which regions of the sequence have a potential to aggregate, any consideration of fibril formation rates must be careful to take the structural properties of monomeric and oligomeric species into account. Taken together, these insights provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces that control the competition between folding, misfolding and aggregation. In addition, they should facilitate the development of rational design strategies to identify reagents capable of inhibiting aggregation by targeting regions known to be critical for the aggregation process.</p>

        <p>Data were recorded as previously described<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> with small variations in the methodology. Briefly, stock solutions of protein in ∼ 5 mM HCl were centrifuged at 543,000<bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 1 h (20 °C) and only the upper two-thirds of the solution was used for fibril growth experiments. For spontaneous fibril growth reactions, 84 μM β<sub>2</sub>m (<italic>n</italic> = 6 and <italic>n</italic> = 9 for wild-type and variant β<sub>2</sub>m samples, respectively) was incubated in pH 2.5 buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM sodium acetate and 0.02% azide) containing 10 μM ThT with agitation (600 rpm) in the wells of 96-well black-wall plates (Costar) and sealed with clear sealing film (Axygen). Measurements were recorded at 25 or 37 °C, as reported. ThT fluorescence was recorded at 5-min intervals using a FLUOstar Optima reader (BMG) as previously described.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Comparison of simultaneous ThT and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements showed that ThT did not interfere with fibril formation, and its fluorescence is a reliable probe of fibril formation (data not shown).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> ΔC83 formed fibrils after incubation of the same samples at 200 rpm for &gt; 4 weeks at 37 °C.</p>
        <p>In the case of seeded reactions at 37 °C, 5% (v/v) seed was added to each reaction and fibril growth was monitored as described above. The seed consisted of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m fibrils, formed in pH 2.5 buffer, agitated (200 rpm) for 1 week at 37 °C and subsequently fragmented by three freeze–thaw cycles. The seeds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b) were stored at − 80 °C, and the same batch of seeds was used for all reactions. For comparison with NMR measurements, the apparent rates of elongation determined using seeded reactions of the second test set of variants were measured at 25 °C with the addition of 2% (v/v) wild-type seed.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
        <p>All data were normalised to the final ThT signal (after 72 h growth), and the resulting curves were used to determine the lag times and apparent rates of elongation. The lag time was obtained by fitting a straight line to the slope of the growth phase between approximately 30% and 70% of the maximum amplitude, and the time at which this line intersected the baseline was taken as the lag time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b, inset).

The data are coloured according to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d. (b) Comparison of the observed elongation rates of wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m and 10 variants (measured at 25 °C) with the predicted <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> scores at low pH; the red line indicates the correlation. (c) <mml:math id="M16" altimg="si3.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mtext>agg</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> scores (including the modulation of the <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> scores through the use of <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation rates) of (b), the outlier where <italic>k</italic><sub>elong</sub> = 0.69 corresponds to F30A. The red line indicates the correlation. In all plots, wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m is represented as a black square.</p>
