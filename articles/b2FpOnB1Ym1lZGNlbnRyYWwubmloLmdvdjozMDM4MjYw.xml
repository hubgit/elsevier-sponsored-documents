      <abstract>
        <p>Human gene association studies have produced conflicting findings regarding the relationship between the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) and anxiety. In the present study genetically modified mice were utilised to examine the effects of changes in 5-HTT expression on anxiety. In addition, the influence of 5-HTT expression on two innate “species-typical” behaviours (burrowing and marble burying) and body weight was explored. Across a range of models, 5-HTT overexpressing mice displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour whilst 5-HTT knockout mice showed increased anxiety-like behaviour, compared to wildtype controls. In tests of species-typical behaviour 5-HTT overexpressing mice showed some facilitation whilst 5-HTT knockout mice were impaired. Reciprocal effects were also seen on body weight, as 5-HTT overexpressors were lighter and 5-HTT knockouts were heavier than wildtype controls. These findings show that variation in 5-HTT gene expression produces robust changes in anxiety and species-typical behaviour. Furthermore, the data add further support to findings that variation of 5-HTT expression in the human population is linked to changes in anxiety-related personality traits.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT/serotonin) has been linked to the pathology of a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and eating disorders (<xref rid="bb0235 bb0100 bb0080 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Owens and Nemeroff, 1994; Handley, 1995; Gorwood, 2004; Hu et al., 2006</xref>). After release, 5-HT is removed from the synapse primarily by the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), which is thus instrumental in regulating 5-HT activity (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bradley and Blakely, 1997</xref>). Studies have demonstrated large natural variation in 5-HTT expression, which is likely to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors (<xref rid="bb0245 bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Pirker et al., 2000; Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>). However, the effects of this variation on personality, cognition, and psychopathology are poorly understood.</p>
      <p>The 5-HTT-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) contains a 44 base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism which gives rise to a long (<italic>l</italic>) or a short (<italic>s</italic>) allele (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Heils et al., 1996</xref>) with the <italic>s</italic> allele leading to reduced 5-HTT expression and the <italic>l</italic> allele increasing 5-HTT expression (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0190 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Heils et al., 1996; Lesch et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2006</xref>), although this remains controversial (<xref rid="bb0200 bb0255 bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Mann et al., 2000; Preuss et al., 2000; Parsey et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>s</italic> allele has been associated with a number of outcomes, including anxiety-related personality traits (<xref rid="bb0190 bb0075 bb0090 bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Lesch et al., 1996; Du et al., 2000; Greenberg et al., 2000; Melke et al., 2001</xref>), mood disorders (<xref rid="bb0195 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Lotrich and Pollock, 2004; Lasky-Su et al., 2005</xref>), and suicide (<xref rid="bb0010 bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Anguelova et al., 2003; Roy et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>s</italic> allele carriers have also been found to display significantly greater amygdala activation to fearful faces (<xref rid="bb0115 bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Hariri et al., 2002; Hariri et al., 2005</xref>) aversive pictures (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2005</xref>) and negative words (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Canli et al., 2005</xref>) compared to non-carriers, which may indicate a role for amygdala hyperresponsivity in the observed vulnerabilities. In addition, <italic>s</italic> allele carriers appear to be more sensitive to stressful life events (<xref rid="bb0055 bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Caspi et al., 2003; Pluess et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>A major difficulty with these studies is that the multitude of genetic and environmental factors which influence behaviour in heterogeneous human populations makes it difficult to firmly establish the role of single genes. Because of this, genetic mouse models have been developed to examine the effect of changes in the expression of the 5-HTT in isolation from other influences. Initial studies examined the effects of loss-of-function of the 5-HTT and observed increased anxiety in some circumstances (<xref rid="bb0145 bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2001; Holmes et al., 2003a; Holmes et al., 2003b</xref>). However, although the 5-HTT knockout (KO) mouse provides useful clues as to the role of the 5-HTT, complete loss-of-function of the 5-HTT is not observed in humans. Thus, an overexpressor (OE) mouse was developed with 5-HTT expression increased to levels similar to those expected from the high expressing human 5-HTT gene variants (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0190 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heils et al., 1996; Lesch et al., 1996; Jennings et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, in comparison to the effects of 5-HTT KO, an initial study indicated reduced anxiety in these animals (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Jennings et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we aimed to compare 5-HTT KO and 5-HTT OE mice with respective wildtype controls on a range of anxiety tasks with varying sensorimotor and motivational demands. In addition, the performance of these mice in three measures of “species-typical” behaviour was investigated. Although previous findings have suggested impaired species-typical behaviour in 5-HTT KO mice (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), 5-HTT OE mice have not been examined. This is significant as these behaviours are sensitive to pharmacological blockade of the 5-HTT (<xref rid="bb0230 bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Njung'e and Handley, 1991; Ichimaru et al., 1995</xref>).</p>

        <title>Animals</title>
        <p>Experiments were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. 5-HTT OE mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were generated on a CBA x C57BL/6J background, as described previously (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Jennings et al., 2006</xref>), and bred in the University of Oxford. 5-HTT KO mice and WT littermates were generated on a 129P1 (129P1/ReJ) x C57BL/6J hybrid background, before being repeatedly backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background for more than eight generations (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bengel et al., 1998</xref>). Both males and females were examined on all tasks. Mice were group housed (4–6 per cage) and all animals were provided with enrichment and <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water unless otherwise stated. Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights off 19:00 to 7:00) in a temperature-controlled environment (21 ± 1 °C). Three separate cohorts were used for the tests of anxiety, locomotor activity and species-typical behaviour.</p>

        <p>Data from the two cohorts (5-HTT OEs and KOs) were analysed separately. Parametric data were analysed using two-way ANOVAs (genotype and sex as between-subject factors). Where data violated assumptions of normality or equality of variance, transformations (log10 or square root) were utilised. For repeated measures ANOVAs, homogeneity of variance was tested using Mauchly's test of sphericity, and where this was violated, Huyn–Feldt corrections were used. Non-parametric data were analysed using Mann–Whitney U tests. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant throughout.</p>

          <p>5-HTT OE mice were significantly faster to enter an open arm [F(1,34) = 9.17 p &lt; 0.01] (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), spent a significantly greater proportion of time in the open arms [F(1,34) = 10.16 p &lt; 0.005] (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) and made a greater proportion of entries into the open arms [F(1,34) = 6.42 p &lt; 0.05] than their wildtype littermates. In contrast, although 5-HTT KO mice did not differ from wildtypes on the latency to first enter an open arm [F(1,12) = 2.20 p = 0.16] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), they spent a significantly reduced proportion of time in the open arms [F(1,12) = 11.64 p &lt; 0.01], and made a significantly smaller proportion of entries into these arms [F(1,12) = 15.23 p &lt; 0.005] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) compared to wildtypes. Neither the 5-HTT OE mice [F(1,34) = 2.73 p = 0.11], nor the 5-HTT KO mice [F(1,12) = 1.59 p = 0.23], differed from their wildtype littermates on the number of entries made into the closed arms of the maze, suggesting that differences in open arm behaviour do not simply reflect general changes in locomotor activity.

The 5-HTT OE mice displayed a significantly shorter latency to enter the first open alley [F(1,44) = 4.08 p = 0.05] (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D) and spent significantly more time in the open alleys [F(1,44) = 5.62 p &lt; 0.05] than wildtypes. They also made more crossings between alleys [F(1,44) = 6.71 p &lt; 0.05]. In the 5-HTT KO cohort no significant effects of genotype were present on any measure [F &lt; 1] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). There were no significant effects of sex or genotype * sex interactions in either cohort.</p>

Although female 5-HTT KO mice made significantly fewer crossings than male 5-HTT KO mice [F(1,12) = 5.10 p &lt; 0.05], no other effects of sex or genotype * sex interactions were present.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of these studies demonstrate a powerful impact of variation in 5-HTT expression on anxiety-related behaviour. Thus, across a range of tasks, genetically-manipulated mice with increased 5-HTT expression showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour, whereas mice lacking 5-HTT expression showed increased anxiety. The results also indicate the importance of 5-HTT expression in species-typical behaviour, with increased and decreased 5-HTT expression being associated with facilitation and disruption, respectively. These differences were observed in both male and female mice, suggesting that the effects of altered 5-HTT expression on anxiety are not influenced by sex in these tests.</p>
      <sec id="s0135">
        <label>4.1</label>
        <title>Anxiety</title>
        <p>5-HTT OE mice displayed reduced anxiety on the elevated plus maze, hyponeophagia and successive alleys tasks, whilst 5-HTT KO animals showed increased anxiety on the elevated plus maze, hyponeophagia and black-white alleys tasks. The finding that differences were not observed in both strains on all tasks may result from floor/ceiling effects (e.g. 5-HTT KO on the successive alleys). However, the present data suggest that both lines exhibit robust changes in anxiety. In particular, the findings of altered anxiety in both (i) the hyponeophagia test and (ii) the elevated plus maze/successive alleys tests suggest that the observed anxiety phenotypes are unlikely to be due to non-specific alterations in motivation or locomotion as these tests produced corresponding results despite differing sensorimotor and motivational demands.</p>
        <p>Anxiety can be conceptualised as occurring when an animal experiences conflict between approach and avoidance responses (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>). As such, increased anxiety manifests as a greater degree of behavioural inhibition, resulting in increased threat avoidance. Therefore, changes in baseline locomotor activity can present a difficulty when interpreting the results of anxiety tasks as they can both result from, and give the appearance of, alterations in anxiety. For example, reduced locomotor activity in the 5-HTT KO mice might result in reduced open arm entries on the plus maze and thus cause them to appear anxious. However, the lack of a change in closed arm entries suggests that the change in open arm behaviour cannot be explained solely by altered locomotor activity. In addition, the 5-HTT KO animals were significantly slower to begin eating on the test of hyponeophagia, suggesting increased anxiety independent of locomotor activity (<xref rid="bb0040 bb0275 bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Britton and Britton, 1981; Shephard and Broadhurst, 1982; Shephard et al., 1984</xref>). Changes in baseline locomotor activity are also unable to explain the reduction in anxiety-like behaviour of the 5-HTT OE mice as the reduced spontaneous activity seen in these animals would be expected to make them appear more – not less – anxious on tests such as the elevated plus maze, successive alleys and black-white alley. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in baseline locomotor activity account for the observed relationship between anxiety and 5-HTT expression.</p>
        <p>The behaviour of the two groups of wildtypes differed considerably, which is likely to result from the different genetic background of the two lines. The 5-HTT KO mutation was backcrossed onto a C57/BL6 background whilst the 5-HTT OE mutation remained on a hybrid background, which would be expected to increase intra-group variation in these animals. However, because transgenic animals were compared only to their respective wildtype littermates, and because the observed phenotypes were diametrically opposite, the differing background strains of the two cohorts are unlikely to account for the pattern of results seen.</p>
        <p>The observed anxiety phenotypes are in agreement with the putative effects of the 5-HTTLPR on 5-HTT expression and anxiety traits in humans. In studies of human personality, the <italic>l</italic> allele of the 5-HTT has been associated with lower levels of neuroticism and associated anxiety-related traits (<xref rid="bb0190 bb0075 bb0090 bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Lesch et al., 1996; Du et al., 2000; Greenberg et al., 2000; Melke et al., 2001</xref>). Although not all studies have concurred, there is evidence that individuals carrying two copies of the <italic>l</italic> allele (in particular, the <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> allele) of the 5-HTTLPR exhibit 2–3 times higher levels of 5-HTT expression and/or uptake activity (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0190 bb0105 bb0095 bb0130 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Heils et al., 1996; Lesch et al., 1996; Hanna et al., 1998; Greenberg et al., 1999; Heinz et al., 2000; Hu et al., 2006</xref>). This increase is comparable in magnitude to that seen in 5-HTT OE mice (both approximately 1.5 to 3-fold) (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Jennings et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the current findings suggest a direct link between increased 5-HTT expression and reduced anxiety, and that decreased levels of anxiety-related traits observed in <italic>l</italic> allele homozygotes may be the result of higher levels of expression of the 5-HTT. In contrast, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act to reduce the activity of the 5-HTT and yet have anxiolytic effects (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Katzman, 2009</xref>). This suggests that genetic alterations in 5-HTT expression (which are present throughout development) result in qualitatively different effects on anxiety to those produced by pharmacological manipulations during adulthood. The causes of this are likely to be complex, but may reflect developmental alterations in stress reactivity (<xref rid="bb0220 bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2010; Way and Taylor, 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous work suggests that 5-HTT OE mice display a normal distribution of 5-HTT expression, which is largely confined to raphé 5-HT neurons and their projections (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Jennings et al., 2006</xref>). However, because these projections are spread across a variety of cortical and subcortical regions, changes in 5-HTT expression results in altered 5-HT activity in a number of brain regions. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the anatomical basis of the phenotypes displayed by 5-HTT OE and KO animals. Despite this, it is notable that all the anxiety tasks described here are sensitive to lesions of the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="bb0015 bb0020 bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Bannerman et al., 2003; Bannerman et al., 2004; McHugh et al., 2004</xref>), whereas they are not affected by amygdala lesions (<xref rid="bb0300 bb0170 bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Treit et al., 1993; Kjelstrup et al., 2002; McHugh et al., 2004</xref>). Thus these data – coupled with the known serotonergic innervation of the hippocampus (<xref rid="bb0210 bb0005" ref-type="bibr">McQuade and Sharp, 1997; Adams et al., 2008</xref>) – implicate the hippocampal formation as a possible anatomical substrate of some of the altered behaviours seen in 5-HTT mutants.</p>

        <title>Species-typical behaviour</title>
        <p>5-HTT KO mice have previously been found to display reduced marble burying behaviour (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), which was confirmed by the present study, whereas 5-HTT OE mice did not differ from wildtypes on this test (although this may have been due to ceiling effects). Exploration of species-typical behaviours was expanded with an examination of burrowing. Although burrowing has been utilised less than marble burying in the laboratory, it represents a sensitive and robust test of species-typical behaviour and – like marble burying – has been shown to be hippocampal-dependent (<xref rid="bb0070 bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Deacon et al., 2002; Deacon, 2006</xref>). 5-HTT KO mice displayed a dramatic impairment in burrowing (none of these mice performed any burrowing), whilst 5-HTT OE animals showed a significant increase in this behaviour. This indicates that – as with anxiety-like behaviour – opposing alterations in 5-HTT expression produce opposite effects on species-typical behaviour.</p>

        <title>Body weight</title>
        <p>5-HT is known to have a suppressive effect on feeding through its actions in both the central nervous system and periphery (<xref rid="bb0030 bb0285 bb0185 bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Blundell, 1986; Silverstone and Goodall, 1986; Leibowitz et al., 1988; Neill and Cooper, 1989</xref>) and drugs which act on the 5-HTT to increase 5-HT availability (such as fenfluramine) have been used clinically to induce weight-loss (<xref rid="bb0060 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Faulds, 1996; Carvajal et al., 2000</xref>). However – as was seen with anxiety – the effects of genetically-induced changes in 5-HTT activity on body weight were diametrically opposed to the effects of acute pharmacological manipulations. Thus, 5-HTT overexpression caused a significant reduction in body weight compared to wildtypes, whereas 5-HTT knockout resulted in an increase in body weight. These results also concord with studies associating the <italic>s</italic> allele of the 5-HTTLPR with obesity (<xref rid="bb0290 bb0295 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Sookoian et al., 2007; Sookoian et al., 2008; Lan et al., 2009</xref>). As these animals have previously been found to display normal feeding behaviour (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Pringle et al., 2008</xref>), 5-HTT overexpression may result in peripheral metabolic or developmental changes. It is also interesting to note that there are indications that the genetic manipulation had a larger effect on the body weight of males than females. This is in agreement with previous findings in animals (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Uceyler et al., 2010</xref>), and raises the possibility that the 5-HTTLPR might have a greater influence on obesity in males than females.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Overall, these findings provide direct evidence that changes in 5-HTT gene expression have robust effects on anxiety and species-typical behaviour. In addition, the findings of this study correlate well with what is known of the behavioural effects of 5-HTT gene variants in humans, supporting the hypothesis that these phenotypes are the result of altered 5-HTT expression.</p>
