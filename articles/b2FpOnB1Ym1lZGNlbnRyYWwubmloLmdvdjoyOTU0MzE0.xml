        <p>Opioids are the most effective analgesics for pain management, and efficient pain control is a therapeutic priority. Herein, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological activities of the 5-benzyl analogue of the μ opioid analgesic 14-methoxymetopon (14-MM). The result of the replacement of the 5-methyl in 14-MM with a benzyl group on <italic>in vitro</italic> opioid receptor binding and functional profiles, and <italic>in vivo</italic> behavioural properties, i.e. nociception and motor activity, was investigated. In rodent brain membranes, the 5-benzyl derivative showed high affinity at the μ opioid receptor and decreased interaction with δ and κ receptors, hence displaying a similar binding profile as 14-MM. It displayed potent agonist activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In <italic>in vitro</italic> guanosine-5′-O-(3-[<sup>35</sup>S]thio)-triphosphate ([<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS) binding assay, it activated G-proteins in rat brain membranes through a μ opioid receptor-mediated mechanism having significantly enhanced potency compared to DAMGO (<sc>d</sc>-Ala<sup>2</sup>,Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>,Gly-ol<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin), and to the μ opioid agonist morphinans 14-MM, 14-<italic>O</italic>-methyloxymorphone (14-OMO) and morphine. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the 5-benzyl analogue of 14-MM elicited dose-dependent and naloxone-sensitive antinociceptive effects in hot-plate and tail-flick tests in mice after subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. Its analgesic potency was comparable to 14-MM, and was 50-fold higher than that of morphine. Contrary to morphine, 14-MM and 14-OMO, no motor dysfunction was produced by the new opioid in the mouse rotarod test at any of the tested doses. In summary, the 5-benzyl analogue of 14-MM emerged as a novel potent μ opioid antinociceptive agent with reduced propensity to cause unwanted motor impairment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pain constitutes a major public-health problem with an enormous impact on both the individual and the society. Debilitating pain and particularly chronic pain is a constant backdrop to daily life, resulting in personal suffering, reduced work productivity and substantial healthcare costs (<xref rid="bib8 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Breivik et al., 2006; Marcus et al., 2009</xref>). Being a disabling symptom of many medical conditions, effective pain control is one of the most important therapeutic priorities. Among analgesic drugs, opioids are the mainstay for the management of moderate to severe pain (<xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Inturrisi, 2002; Jain, 2004; Benyamin et al., 2008</xref>). The opioid class of analgesics includes several clinically used pain relieving agents such as naturally occurring alkaloids (e.g. morphine, codeine), semisynthetic derivatives (e.g. oxycodone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine), and synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl, pethidine, tramadol). All these opioid drugs as well as endogenous opioid peptides produce their biological actions by interacting with three receptor types, μ, δ and κ, belonging to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref rid="bib27 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Knapp et al., 1995; Kieffer and Evans, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Morphine and other opioids produce analgesia primarily through their agonist action at the μ opioid receptor, which is the main type targeted for the pharmacotherapy of pain. However, currently used opioid analgesics also share a number of severe side effects (e.g. respiratory depression, nausea, sedation, dizziness, motor disturbances and constipation), making their clinical usefulness problematic and leading to early discontinuation, under-dosing and inadequate analgesia (<xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Inturrisi, 2002; Jain, 2004; Benyamin et al., 2008</xref>). Increasing drug deaths from opioids is a serious issue (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benyamin et al., 2008</xref>). Considerable effort has therefore been put forward to understand the appropriate use of opioid analgesics, while medicinal chemistry and opioid pharmacology have been continuously engaged in the search for safer, more efficacious and non-addicting opioid compounds, with the final goal to reduce complications and to improve patient compliance.</p>
      <p>Our research in the morphinan class of opioid analgesics has led us to obtain a number of 14-alkoxymorphinan-6-ones that act as effective antinociceptive agents in various animal models of pain (<xref rid="bib42 bib43 bib12 bib13 bib16 bib45 bib46 bib49 bib47 bib29 bib1 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1984, 1990; Fürst et al., 1993, 2005; Greiner et al., 2003; Schütz et al., 2003; Spetea et al., 2004a,b, 2005; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Al-Khrasani et al., 2007; Obara et al., 2007</xref>). Previous pharmacological reports described a derivative of oxymorphone, 14-<italic>O</italic>-methyloxymorphone (14-OMO, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which possesses about 40-fold higher antinociceptive potency than its parent compound, and is up to 400-fold more potent than the ‘gold standard’ for pain therapy, morphine, in rodent models of acute nociception, i.e. hot-plate test (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1984</xref>) and tail-flick test (<xref rid="bib13 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Fürst et al., 2005; Riba et al., 2010</xref>), after subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. However, 14-OMO induces the typical opioid side effects of the conventional μ opioid analgesics including constipation, respiratory depression and physical dependence (<xref rid="bib42 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1984; Lattanzi et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Further synthetic and pharmacological work based on the introduction of a methyl group at position 5 of 14-OMO gave rise to 14-methoxymetopon (14-MM, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1990</xref>), a potent and high affinity μ opioid receptor agonist <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib12 bib50 bib46 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Fürst et al., 1993; Spetea et al., 2003, 2004a; Mahurter et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, 14-MM retains the high antinociceptive potency of the parent molecule and is considerably more active than morphine in producing analgesia in diverse thermal, chemical and inflammatory pain models, after different routes of administration (s.c., intraperitoneal, intracebroventricular and intrathecal) and in different species (rats and mice) (<xref rid="bib43 bib12 bib54 bib25 bib51 bib16 bib29 bib5 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1990; Fürst et al., 1993; Zernig et al., 2000; King et al., 2003; Urigüen et al., 2002; Greiner et al., 2003; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Bileviciute-Ljungar et al., 2006; Riba et al., 2010</xref>). It was equipotent to sufentanil in eliciting analgesia in canines after intravenous administration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Freye et al., 2000</xref>). Behaviour studies showed that 14-MM causes less pronounced opioid adverse actions in terms of respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, constipation, physical dependence, addiction potential and tolerance (<xref rid="bib12 bib11 bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Fürst et al., 1993; Freye et al., 2000; King et al., 2003; Király et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>In view of these findings, we aimed in this study to investigate the effect of the replacement of the 5-methyl group in 14-MM with a benzyl substituent (compound <bold>1</bold>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) on the pharmacological profile represented by <italic>in vitro</italic> opioid receptor binding and functional activities, and <italic>in vivo</italic> behavioural properties, i.e. nociception and motor function, after s.c. administration to mice. Consequently, we have conducted a comparison of the pharmacological activities and physicochemical properties of compound <bold>1</bold> to those of structurally related opioid morphinans, 14-MM and 14-OMO, and of the clinically relevant morphine. Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies in this class of opioid compounds based on substitution of the 5-methyl group in 14-MM with an arylalkyl group such as benzyl may provide relevant information in the drug discovery process for identification of novel and safer analgesics towards the treatment of pain.</p>

          <p>Sodium hydride (1.2 g, 50 mmol) (obtained from 2.0 g 60% sodium hydride dispersion in oil by washings with petroleum ether) was added to a stirred solution of 5β-benzyl-14-hydroxycodeinone (<bold>2</bold>) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gates et al., 1989</xref>) (7.95 g, 19.7 mmol) in 100 ml anhydrous <italic>N,N</italic>-dimethylformamide under nitrogen at 0 °C (bath temperature). After 15 min, dimethyl sulfate (2.43 ml, 25.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C (bath temperature). Excess sodium hydride was destroyed carefully by addition of small pieces of ice. Then the mixture was diluted with water (250 ml) and extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 100 ml); the combined organic layers were washed with water (1 × 100 ml, 3 × 60 ml) and brine (100 ml), dried (sodium sulfate), and evaporated to give 8.3 g of a yellow-brown colored oil. Part of this oil was used for the next synthetic step without further purification while 500 mg of this oil were purified by column chromatography (silica gel, elution with methylene chloride/methanol/concentrated ammonia, 250:2:0.5) to afford a yellowish oil (210 mg).

          <p>Hot-plate latencies are determined as described (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lattanzi et al., 2005</xref>) by placing each mouse on a TSE hot plate V2.0 plate (TSE System Inc., Midland, MI, USA) kept at 55 °C and observing the occurrence of a nociceptive response (licking of a hind paw, jumping). To confine the mice to a certain observation area, a colourless plastic cylinder of 20 cm diameter was placed on the hot-plate. In order to avoid possible tissue injury, a cut-off time of 12 s was used.</p>
          <p>The tail-flick test was performed using an UB 37360 Ugo Basile analgesiometer (Ugo Basile s.r.l., Varese, Italy) as described (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Greiner et al., 2003</xref>). The reaction time required by the mouse to remove its tail due to the radiant heat was measured and defined as the tail-flick latency. A cut-off time of 10 s was used in order to minimize tissue damage.</p>
          <p>Hot-plate and tail-flick latencies were measured before (basal latency, BL) and 30 min after drug s.c. administration (test latency, TL). For establishing the dose–response effect, the antinociceptive response was expressed as percent of Maximum Possible Effect (%MPE) = [(TL − BL)/(cut-off time − BL)] × 100 for each dose tested. Each experimental group included five mice.

        <p>Binding affinities of compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) at opioid receptors were determined <italic>in vitro</italic> using competition binding assays in rat brain (μ, δ) and guinea pig brain (κ) membrane preparations, and employing [<sup>3</sup>H]DAMGO (μ), [<sup>3</sup>H][Ile<sup>5,6</sup>]deltorphin II (δ) and [<sup>3</sup>H]U69,593 (κ) as specific opioid radioligands (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2003</xref>). The μ, δ and κ opioid receptor binding affinities expressed as inhibition constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>) are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For comparison purposes, the opioid binding affinity data for 14-MM (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2003</xref>), 14-OMO (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2004a</xref>) and morphine (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2003</xref>) are included.</p>
        <p>In <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, compound <bold>1</bold> was shown to bind with high affinity at the μ opioid receptor (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.31 nM), and with two orders of magnitude lower affinities at δ and κ receptors (13.1 and 22.8 nM, respectively), hence displaying a comparable binding profile as the parent compound 14-MM and its 5-unsubstituted analogue 14-OMO (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

        <title><italic>In vitro</italic> stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding</title>
        <p>The effect of the 5-benzyl analogue <bold>1</bold> on G-protein activation was evaluated using the ligand-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding assay in rat brain membranes (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2003</xref>). Its stimulatory effect was compared with that of 14-MM, 14-OMO, morphine and the prototype μ opioid receptor agonist DAMGO.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, compound <bold>1</bold>, 14-MM, 14-OMO, morphine and DAMGO produced concentration-dependent increase in [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding. Agonist potencies (ED<sub>50</sub>) and maximal response (<italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub>) values were determined and are listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The rank order of potencies in stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding was: compound <bold>1</bold> &gt; 14-OMO &gt; 14-MM &gt; DAMGO &gt; morphine. The mean maximal response was higher for 14-MM and 14-OMO and somewhat lower for compound <bold>1</bold> and morphine than that of DAMGO.</p>
        <p>Compound <bold>1</bold> was shown to be the most potent agonist with an ED<sub>50</sub> value of 13.7 nM, whereas its parent compound 14-MM had a potency of 63 nM in stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding in rat brain membranes. It displayed a comparable efficacy to morphine, but it was less efficacious than DAMGO, 14-MM and 14-OMO (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Also, 14-OMO activated G-proteins as indicated by the concentration-dependent increases in [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) showing a significantly increased agonist potency (ED<sub>50</sub> = 23.7 nM) than 14-MM and DAMGO, while exhibiting comparable efficacy (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to assess the specificity of G-protein activation via opioid receptors by compound <bold>1</bold>, agonist-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding was probed with the opioid antagonist naloxone. Similar to 14-MM, 14-OMO and DAMGO, the increase of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding produced by compound <bold>1</bold> (1 μM) was prevented by naloxone (1 μM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to establish the μ opioid receptor specificity of stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by compound <bold>1</bold>, we examined the ability of type selective opioid receptor antagonists to reverse the G-protein activating effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding assays were conducted by incubation of compound <bold>1</bold> (1 μM) in the presence and absence of selective antagonists acting at the μ (CTAP) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 1989</xref>), δ (NTI) (<xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Portoghese et al., 1988a,b</xref>) or κ (nor-BNI) (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Portoghese et al., 1987</xref>) opioid receptors. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the increase of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by compound <bold>1</bold> was reversed by co-incubation with CTAP in a concentration-dependent manner. As well, CTAP has caused antagonism of stimulatory actions produced by either 1 μM of 14-MM, 14-OMO or DAMGO. Conversely, NTI (10 nM) and nor-BNI (100 nM) had no significant effect on compound <bold>1</bold>-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding, as also observed with the other μ opioid agonists, 14-MM, 14-OMO and DAMGO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Concentrations of antagonists, CTAP, NTI and nor-BNI, were chosen based on observations that the corresponding agonist-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding, i.e. DAMGO (μ) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), SNC80 (δ) and U69,593 (κ) (data not shown), respectively, was selectively inhibited by the antagonist.</p>

Antinociceptive ED<sub>50</sub> values and 95% confidence limits were calculated and are presented in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, compound <bold>1</bold> produced dose-dependent antinociceptive effects after systemic s.c. administration to mice in both nociceptive tests. The antinociceptive dose necessary to elicit a 50% effect was 0.053 mg/kg in the hot-plate test, and a similar ED<sub>50</sub> value of 0.043 mg/kg was determined in the tail-flick test. Compared to morphine, compound <bold>1</bold> showed more than 50-fold increased analgesic potency (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In line with previous reports (<xref rid="bib54 bib25 bib16 bib29 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zernig et al., 2000; King et al., 2003; Greiner et al., 2003; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Riba et al., 2010</xref>), 14-MM was found to be 80-fold more potent than morphine in both thermal nociceptive assays in mice following s.c. administration. Similarly, s.c. 14-OMO exhibited over 150-fold enhanced antinociceptive potency than morphine, in agreement with earlier findings in rodents (<xref rid="bib42 bib13 bib29 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhammer et al., 1984; Fürst et al., 2005; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Riba et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the antinociceptive actions of compound <bold>1</bold> are mediated through opioid receptor interactions, we examined the effect of pre-treatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone in mice that subsequently received compound <bold>1</bold>. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, s.c. dosing of mice with compound <bold>1</bold> (0.1 mg/kg) produced significant increases in both hot-plate and tail-flick responses, which were reversed by naloxone injected 10 min before the agonist (1 mg/kg, s.c.) to exhibit similar values as elicited by saline-treated animals.</p>

        <p>Dose-dependent drug effects on motor performance induced by compound <bold>1</bold>, 14-MM, 14-OMO and morphine in the mouse rotarod test are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding and functional assays compiled with <italic>in vivo</italic> behavioural approaches that replacement of the methyl group in position 5 in 14-MM with a benzyl substituent leads to qualitative and quantitative differences in the interaction with opioid receptors. The results indicate that the 5-benzyl analogue of 14-MM, compound <bold>1</bold>, exhibits high affinity and potent agonism at the μ opioid receptor and shows antinociceptive efficacy through opioid receptor-mediated mechanisms achieved at doses that had no significant effect on motor activity.</p>
      <p>Following the pattern of SAR, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological profile shown by the investigated opioid ligands is related to specific structural features. Substitution of the 5-methyl group in 14-MM with a benzyl group left binding affinities at δ and κ opioid receptors essentially unchanged while retaining the high affinity at the μ receptor (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 0.15 nM for 14-MM vs. 0.31 nM for compound <bold>1</bold>). The assessment of binding affinities of 14-OMO and its 5-benzyl analogue <bold>1</bold> revealed that the introduction of an arylalkyl group, i.e. benzyl at position 5, maintained the high affinity at the μ receptor, with only a minor decrease in affinities at δ and κ receptors, hence still displaying μ opioid receptor selectivity. These data confirm and extend previous SAR observations in terms of opioid receptor binding in this series of opioid compounds, when comparing 5-unsubstituted to their 5-methyl substituted analogues (<xref rid="bib46 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2004a; Lattanzi et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>When examining the <italic>in vitro</italic> opioid binding profile of compound <bold>1</bold> and its 3-methoxy analogue <bold>4</bold>, it became apparent that the presence of a methoxy group at position 3 has a major effect on binding affinities to all three opioid receptor types. The present observations on the detrimental effect on the interaction with opioid receptors upon substitution at the 3-hydroxy group in the morphinan skeleton support earlier reports (<xref rid="bib4 bib37 bib9 bib34 bib48 bib44 bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Beyerman et al., 1976; Pasternak et al., 1987; Chen et al., 1991; Mignat et al., 1995; Spetea et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2004; Crooks et al., 2006</xref>). A representative example is the comparison of binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> values in nM) of oxymorphone (μ:δ:κ = 0.97:80.5:61.6) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lattanzi et al., 2005</xref>) with its 3-methoxy analogue oxycodone (μ:δ:κ = 43.6:1087:2658) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2005</xref>). This phenomenon was also described for morphine having a methylated (i.e. codeine) or glucuronidated (i.e. morphine-3-glucoronide) hydroxyl group at position 3 (<xref rid="bib37 bib34 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Pasternak et al., 1987; Mignat et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Similar to the structurally related derivatives, 14-MM and 14-OMO, compound <bold>1</bold> is characterized by agonist activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, while exhibiting a distinct functional profile. In <italic>in vitro</italic> [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding assays, among all investigated opioid ligands, compound <bold>1</bold> was shown to be the most potent agonist in G-protein activation having a 23-fold greater ED<sub>50</sub> value than that of the standard μ opioid agonist DAMGO, and producing 85% of the maximum stimulation observed with DAMGO. Although it was as efficacious as morphine in stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding, compound <bold>1</bold> proved to be considerably more potent by more than 30-fold. Comparable ED<sub>50</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> values to the earlier reported (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2003</xref>) were determined in this study for 14-MM-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding in rat brain membranes. Notably, here we also report the first data on stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by 14-OMO. 14-OMO activated G-proteins as indicated by the concentration-dependent increases in [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding showing over 13-fold greater potency than DAMGO, while exhibiting comparable efficacy. We have also established that 14-OMO-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding is a μ opioid receptor-mediated event like that shown by 14-MM. The enhanced agonist potency of 14-OMO compared to DAMGO as well as to morphine determined by [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding assays is in agreement with pharmacological findings in <italic>in vitro</italic> bioassays using mouse vas deferens (MVD), guinea pig ileum (GPI) and rat vas deferens preparations (<xref rid="bib46 bib29 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2004a; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Riba et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>In vitr</italic>o, compound <bold>1</bold> activated G-proteins by specific stimulation of μ opioid receptors in rat brain membranes. This has been demonstrated based on reversibility of the increase of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by compound <bold>1</bold> in the presence of the selective μ opioid receptor antagonist CTAP (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 1989</xref>) and the lack of effect of NTI (<xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Portoghese et al., 1988a,b</xref>) and nor-NBI (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Portoghese et al., 1987</xref>), as selective antagonists at δ and κ opioid receptors, respectively. CTAP (1 and 10 μM), NTI (10 nM) and nor-BNI (100 nM) at tested concentrations blocked stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by opioid agonists selective at μ (DAMGO, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), δ ([<sc>d</sc>-Pen<sup>2</sup>, <sc>d-</sc>Pen<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin) and κ opioid receptors (U50,488H), respectively (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mizoguchi et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> functional results, the presence of a benzyl group in position 5 in compound <bold>1</bold> yielded a novel μ opioid agonist, displaying a 5-fold increase in potency compared to its 5-methyl analogue 14-MM, while it appears to be less efficacious in stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding. Although the affinity of analogue <bold>1</bold> for opioid receptors is essentially not different from that of 14-MM, it is possible that the presence of an arylalkyl group like benzyl at position 5 increases the potency of this agonist. A similar profile was observed when comparing agonist activities of the 5-benzyl derivative <bold>1</bold> to its 5-unsubstituted analogue 14-OMO. Methylation at position 5 of 14-OMO resulted in 14-MM, which shows less than 3-fold decrease in potency and similar maximal stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding. The present observations on 14-MM and 14-OMO as potent agonists corroborate with described <italic>in vitro</italic> activities in MVD, GPI and RVD bioassays (<xref rid="bib46 bib29 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Spetea et al., 2004a; Lattanzi et al., 2005; Riba et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>In vivo</italic>, compound <bold>1</bold> appeared to be a potent opioid agonist by exhibiting antinociceptive activity after systemic s.c. administration in mouse models of nociceptive pain. Its antinociceptive effects were reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone, supporting an opioid receptor-mediated mechanism of action. In both hot-plate and tail-flick tests, compound <bold>1</bold> produced a dose-dependent increase in withdrawal latencies in response to a thermal stimulus giving ED<sub>50</sub> values in the μg range, i.e. 0.053 and 0.043 mg/kg. For comparison, s.c. morphine showed ED<sub>50</sub> values of 2.63 and 2.29 mg/kg, respectively, in the two nociceptive assessments.</p>
      <p>The antinociceptive potency of compound <bold>1</bold> was found to be only 1.9- and 1.5-fold lower than that of 14-MM in the hot-plate and tail-flick tests, respectively, and it was 50-fold higher than that of the ‘gold standard painkiller’ morphine. Thus, replacement of the 5-methyl group in 14-MM with a benzyl substituent appears to be well tolerated by giving rise to a highly potent and efficacious antinociceptive agent. Also, the introduction of a benzyl group at position 5 in 14-OMO, affording compound <bold>1</bold>, produced only a modest change (3-fold decrease) in antinociceptive potency. The SAR observations derived in this study from the <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological findings on antinociceptive properties are in qualitative agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> opioid activities of the investigated opioid morphinans.</p>
      <p>μ Opioid analgesics including morphine, codeine, oxycodone and fentanyl are known to depress motor activity, a side effect that limits their usefulness (<xref rid="bib19 bib6 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Tyers, 1983; Bowdle, 1998; Meert and Vermeirsch, 2005</xref>). To further address the behavioural consequences of the μ receptor agonist profile exhibited by the 5-benzyl analogue of 14-MM, its effects on motor coordination using the rotarod test were assessed across an antinociceptive effective range. In addition, the first behavioural data on alterations in motor function following systemic s.c. administration of 14-MM and 14-OMO are reported.</p>
      <p>Results from behavioural investigations have shown that s.c. dosing of compound <bold>1</bold> to mice did not significantly affect the performance in the rotarod test over the analgesic dose range of 0.025–0.2 mg/kg. By comparison at equianalgesic doses, systemic morphine caused dose-dependent suppressive effects on motor coordination with significance at 10 mg/kg, a finding consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="bib14 bib23 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Gallantine and Meert, 2005; Jones et al., 2005; Meert and Vermeirsch, 2005</xref>). Dosages that produce full antinociceptive efficacy of the μ opioid agonists 14-MM (0.1 mg/kg) and 14-OMO (0.06 mg/kg) were also observed to diminish motor ability in the rotarod test. The mechanism responsible for the impairment of normal motor function has been proposed to be linked to the μ opioid receptor activation in the basal ganglia, nucleus raphe pontis, periaqueductal gray and locus coeruleus (<xref rid="bib18 bib17 bib53 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Havemann et al., 1980, 1982; Vankova et al., 1996; Bowdle, 1998</xref>). Outcomes of the rotarod experiments compiled with nociceptive behaviour findings indicated that replacing the 5-methyl group with a benzyl substituent in 14-MM led to an opioid ligand, which achieves antinociceptive efficacy at doses that do not significantly influence motor activity.</p>
      <p>We experimentally determined the physicochemical properties of compound <bold>1</bold> and found that the substitution of the methyl group in position 5 in 14-MM with a benzyl group leads to a more liphophilic molecule, while also showing increased liphophilicity compared to its 5-unsubstituted analogue 14-OMO. Thus, compound <bold>1</bold> which displays considerable higher liphophilicity than 14-MM, 14-OMO and morphine may represent a feasible candidate for oral and/or transdermal delivery.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have described the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a novel μ opioid receptor ligand, the 5-benzyl analogue of 14-MM, which emerged as a high affinity and potent μ opioid antinociceptive agent with reduced propensity to cause unwanted motor impairment. Our findings revealed that targeting position 5 represents a viable approach for tuning the pharmacological properties of this class of opioids. The results of the present work complement and sharpen the understanding that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan template could afford opioid ligands that besides their scientific value as pharmacological tools, may also have the potential of emerging as novel analgesics with fewer side effects compared to currently available treatments.</p>
