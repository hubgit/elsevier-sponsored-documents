        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The core planar polarity proteins localize asymmetrically to the adherens junctions of epithelial cells, where they have been hypothesized to assemble into intercellular complexes. Here, we show that the core proteins are preferentially distributed to discrete membrane subdomains (“puncta”), where they form asymmetric contacts between neighboring cells. Using an antibody internalization assay and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in prepupal and pupal wings, we have investigated the turnover of two key core proteins, Flamingo and Frizzled, and find that the localization of both within puncta is highly stable. Furthermore, the transmembrane core proteins, Flamingo, Frizzled, and Strabismus, are necessary for stable localization of core proteins to junctions, whereas the cytoplasmic core proteins are required for their concentration into puncta. Thus, we define the distinct roles of specific core proteins in the formation of asymmetric contacts between cells, which is a key event in the generation of coordinated cellular asymmetry.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Polarization of cells in a plane perpendicular to the apicobasal axis is a fundamental property of epithelia, and is of importance for multiple aspects of animal development. It is best characterized in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, where each cell produces a single actin-rich trichome that points distally. A common group of “core planar polarity proteins” has been found to control planar polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other animals (<xref rid="bib28 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Strutt, 2008; McNeill, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In both flies and vertebrates, the core proteins localize asymmetrically within cells prior to morphological signs of polarization (<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib32 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Rida and Chen, 2009; Roszko et al., 2009; Strutt and Strutt, 2009; Hashimoto and Hamada, 2010</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early pupal wing, asymmetric localization is seen within the adherens junction region, oriented toward the wing margin (<xref rid="bib7 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al., 2005; Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). Cell rearrangements then lead to a remodeling of asymmetry, such that it aligns on the proximodistal (PD) axis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, at the time that trichomes emerge, the seven-pass transmembrane protein Frizzled (Fz) localizes distally, together with the cytoplasmic proteins Dishevelled (Dsh) and Diego (Dgo), whereas the transmembrane protein Strabismus (Stbm, also known as Van Gogh) and the cytoplasmic protein Prickle (Pk) localize proximally, and the seven-pass transmembrane cadherin Flamingo (Fmi, also known as Starry Night) localizes both proximally and distally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A; reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>A working model for the generation of this cellular asymmetry relies on both the establishment of molecular asymmetry, whereby the individual core proteins interact in an asymmetric complex spanning intercellular junctions, and the polarized distribution of such asymmetric complexes within cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>
      <p>The view that the core proteins form an asymmetric complex is based principally on their patterns of localization. Aggregation experiments in S2 cells suggest that Fmi can interact homophilically via its extracellular cadherin repeats (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Usui et al., 1999</xref>), and various other protein-protein interactions have been seen in vitro, or in transfected cells (reviewed in <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">McNeill, 2010</xref>), but have proved difficult to demonstrate in vivo. Nevertheless, the notion of a complex is central to current models of planar polarity establishment (e.g., <xref rid="bib2 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005; Klein and Mlodzik, 2005; Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>). Major questions remain regarding how asymmetric complexes are assembled and whether they are stable entities.</p>
      <p>We previously showed that the transmembrane proteins are key to forming an intrinsically asymmetric complex in the pupal wing (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>). In the absence of both Fz and Stbm, Fmi is not localized stably to junctions, and is instead found in the apical plasma membrane. However, Fz-Fmi in the junctions of one cell appear able to interact with Fmi in the neighboring cell, and the presence of both Fz and Stbm further increases Fmi localization to junctions. A plausible hypothesis is that in the absence of Fz and Stbm, Fmi is subjected to high rates of endocytic turnover, and that this turnover is inhibited once it forms asymmetric complexes with Fz and Stbm.</p>
      <p>In support of this view, both Fmi and Fz appear subject to constant endocytic flux. Both are seen in Rab5-positive endocytic vesicles and accumulate when lysosomal degradation or recycling is blocked (<xref rid="bib31 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008; Mottola et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, live imaging shows movement of large intracellular puncta containing Fz-EGFP across pupal wing cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>). The colocalization of these Fz-GFP puncta with the endosomal marker FM4-64 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>), and experiments where Fmi-EGFP expression was transiently induced (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>), both support the view that some of this vesicular Fmi and Fz is returning from the plasma membrane, rather than being newly synthesized. However, it remains to be established the degree to which plasma membrane populations of Fmi and Fz turn over in vivo, and how this is modulated by asymmetric complex formation.</p>
      <p>How molecularly asymmetric complexes then become distributed in the same orientation at particular cell edges is also unknown: the most favored model is that it is a self-organizing process, dependent on feedback loops. Such a process would produce local cell-cell organization, which is thought to be globally organized by an upstream cue (reviewed in <xref rid="bib18 bib39 bib32 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Klein and Mlodzik, 2005; Zallen, 2007; Strutt and Strutt, 2009; Vladar et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cytoplasmic proteins Dsh, Pk, and Dgo are not necessary for localization of Fmi, Fz, and Stbm to junctions (<xref rid="bib35 bib11 bib25 bib27 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Usui et al., 1999; Feiguin et al., 2001; Shimada et al., 2001; Strutt, 2001; Bastock et al., 2003</xref>), or for polarized signaling to neighboring cells (<xref rid="bib30 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2007; Chen et al., 2008</xref>). However, they are needed for the generation of cellular asymmetry through asymmetric localization of Fmi, Fz, and Stbm within the cell. We hypothesize that they may act chiefly by “clustering” asymmetric protein complexes of the same polarity.</p>
      <p>To investigate further we have used the two independent approaches of antibody internalization assays and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to analyze the turnover of the core proteins Fz and Fmi in pupal wings. We show that:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Fz and Stbm cooperate to stably localize Fmi to junctions; and remaining “unstable” Fmi is removed by Rab5- and Dynamin-dependent processes.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>In the presence of the other core proteins, highly stable fractions of Fmi and Fz are concentrated in membrane subdomains (“puncta”). Cytoplasmic components such as Dsh and Pk are not required to generate the stable junctional fractions of Fz and Fmi but are necessary for their concentration into puncta, most likely by limiting lateral diffusion.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Puncta are sites of asymmetric protein localization, and accumulation in puncta is correlated with the acquisition of cellular asymmetry.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Thus, we define the roles of the core proteins in a two-part model for establishment of planar polarity. First, Fz, Fmi, and Stbm can form intrinsically stable asymmetric complexes in the absence of the cytoplasmic components. Second, the cytoplasmic components promote “clustering” of asymmetric complexes into puncta, producing local domains of asymmetry.</p>

        <title>Measurement of Fmi Trafficking from the Cell Surface</title>
        <p>To measure the gross endocytic turnover of Fmi, we used an antibody internalization assay on live pupal wing tissue. The core proteins are most strongly asymmetrically localized just before trichome initiation at around 28 hr after prepupa formation (APF) (<xref rid="bib32 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2009; Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>); however, at this stage the pupal wing is encased in cuticle that prevents antibody access. To circumvent this, prepupal wings (5–6 hr APF) were used. Asymmetric localization of the core proteins is seen at this stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C, 1E, and 1F; see also <xref rid="bib7 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al., 2005; Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>), although it is less coherent than at 28 hr and oriented toward the wing margin. A monoclonal antibody against Fmi was used (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Usui et al., 1999</xref>), which gives negligible background staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Live prepupal wings were dissected in Schneider's Medium, and incubated at 4°C with antibody against Fmi, followed by washing and chasing at room temperature (RT) for up to 30 min before fixation. The amount of Fmi remaining at the cell surface was determined via incubation with secondary antibody in the absence of detergent, revealing a reduction over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>G and 1H; and see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). This loss of extracellular staining reflects internalization of Fmi because no antibody dissociated in control experiments in which tissue was fixed prior to antibody incubation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). Furthermore, incubation with secondary antibody in the presence of detergent revealed that the loss of extracellular Fmi was accompanied by the appearance of Fmi antibody in intracellular puncta, which were initially seen just below the apical junctions, and spread more basally over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>I and 1J; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A–S2E).</p>
        <p>Crosslinking of Fmi by the bivalent whole antibody could cause clustering that might either stimulate or inhibit internalization; therefore, we generated Fab antibody fragments. These Fab fragments stained live prepupal wings similarly to full-length antibody (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E); however, the binding affinity was poorer, and antibody dissociated over time (40% over 20 min, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). Nevertheless, internalization was evident because the loss of extracellular staining was greater than could be accounted for by antibody falloff (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>C and S1C′), and Fmi Fab antibody was detected in intracellular puncta (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>F–S1H).</p>
        <p>Extracellular Fmi staining decreased rapidly within the first 10 min, and subsequently the rate slowed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). This does not reflect a general defect in endocytosis due to prolonged culture because Dextran internalization was similar throughout the chase period (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>I and S1J). Instead, this may be due to either recycling of internalized Fmi to the cell surface, or the presence of a stable population(s) of Fmi at the cell surface that is resistant to endocytosis.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Internalized Fmi Enters Both Degradative and Recycling Pathways</title>
        <p>To investigate further we tested whether Fmi internalization occurred via Dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Expression of a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>shibire</italic> (<italic>shi</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene encoding Dynamin<italic>)</italic> at the restrictive temperature caused a subtle accumulation of extracellular Fmi (1.4-fold above wild-type tissue, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C). The small increase in steady-state levels of Fmi at junctions may reflect feedback, in which reduced endocytosis is balanced by reduced delivery of Fmi to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, after a 15-min chase to allow internalization of antibody-bound Fmi, a greater proportion of extracellular Fmi remained in <italic>shi</italic> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue (30% less internalization), and also fewer intracellular puncta were seen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B–2D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). The residual internalization of Fmi is likely to be in part due to incomplete loss of <italic>shi</italic> activity in the region quantified, although we cannot exclude the possibility of Dynamin-independent endocytosis of Fmi. We conclude that Fmi internalization is at least partially Dynamin dependent.</p>
        <p>Expression of dominant-negative Rab5 (Rab5<sup>SN</sup>) for 2 hr also reduced Fmi internalization (20% less internalization, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E); again the incomplete blockage of Fmi endocytosis probably reflects the incomplete loss of Rab5 activity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>D). Consistent with Fmi being trafficked via Rab5, a subset of internalized Fmi colocalized strongly with Rab5 vesicles (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>F). Internalized Fmi also partially colocalized with Rab7 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>G), and excess accumulation of internalized Fmi was seen when lysosomal maturation was disrupted in <italic>deep orange</italic> (<italic>dor</italic>) clones (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>E), suggesting that Fmi enters a degradative pathway.</p>
        <p>The slowing in the rate of Fmi loss from the cell surface over time could indicate that some Fmi is normally recycled to the plasma membrane, either via the fast Rab4-dependent pathway, or the slow Rab11-dependent mechanism. Expression of either dominant-negative Rab4 alone or Rab11 RNAi alone did not significantly affect Fmi internalization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and 2G). However, coexpression of Rab11 RNAi and dominant-negative Rab4 led to a more rapid loss of Fmi from the cell surface than in wild-type tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>H; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>M–S3Q).</p>
        <p>Only occasional colocalization was seen between internalized Fmi puncta and Rab11 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>H), and we do not have a reliable marker for the Rab4 compartment (see legend to <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>M). However, when dominant-negative Rab4 was expressed, more frequent (although still rare) colocalization of Fmi puncta with Rab11 was seen (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>I). These data are consistent with Fmi normally being recycled via the rapid Rab4 pathway. Most likely, loss of Rab4 does not block Fmi recycling but shifts it into the slower Rab11 pathway.</p>

        <title>A Population of Fmi Localizes Persistently to Junctional Puncta</title>
        <p>Although our data show that recycling contributes to the observed slowing of removal of cell surface Fmi, we also find evidence for a population of Fmi that is resistant to endocytosis. At 0 min extracellular Fmi localized both at apical junctions, where it is enriched in punctate structures, and also to the apical plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H). However, by 30 min, the only detectable extracellular Fmi staining was in discrete puncta within the apical junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>E and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A–S2E). This suggests that in addition to apical and junctional nonpuncta populations of Fmi that are subject to endocytosis, there is a junctional puncta population of Fmi subject to little or no endocytosis. Quantitation of the different Fmi populations revealed that there was no change in the mean intensity of Fmi staining in junctional puncta, whereas Fmi from junctional regions lacking puncta was internalized at an intermediate rate, and apical Fmi was rapidly internalized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Thus, there is a persistent plasma membrane fraction of Fmi concentrated in junctional puncta. Notably, this colocalizes strongly with other core proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C; data not shown).</p>
        <p>High-resolution images of 28-hr pupal wings showed that at this stage, proximally and distally localizing polarity proteins were also concentrated in puncta in PD junctions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>D–3F; see also <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, mosaic analysis showed that puncta are the major sites of asymmetry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>H–3K; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A). Interestingly, these puncta define a distinct membrane compartment that does not colocalize with other adherens junction markers such as Armadillo and E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G; data not shown).</p>
        <p>Staining for total Fmi in 5.5- and 20-hr wings also showed core protein colocalization in junctional puncta (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>L, 3M, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, and 4D). However, at 20 hr APF, when cells are undergoing junctional remodeling, asymmetric localization is poor (<xref rid="bib7 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al., 2005; Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>), and puncta are smaller than at 28 hr (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Q). Notably, the loss of cellular asymmetry seen in <italic>dgo</italic>, <italic>pk</italic>, or <italic>dsh</italic> mutant tissue also results in the core proteins forming progressively smaller puncta of slightly reduced intensity (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>N–3R, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F, and 6G; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>B–S4M), correlating with the strength of polarity defects seen in these backgrounds (see <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>Overall, we find that in addition to an unstable population of Fmi that is subject to endocytosis and recycling, there is a population that is apparently refractory to turnover and localized to junctional puncta that are the major sites of asymmetry. Time-lapse imaging of Fz-EYFP demonstrates that such puncta persist over several hours (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure 3</xref>S and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Movie S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>FRAP Reveals Stable Fractions of Core Proteins in Puncta</title>
        <p>To distinguish whether proteins within puncta are stably localized, or if puncta are persistent but the protein content changes, we used FRAP in pupal wings to measure turnover in real time. We employed two transgenes, one expressing <italic>fz-EYFP</italic> under the <italic>Actin5C</italic> promoter (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Strutt, 2001</xref>), and the other expressing <italic>fmi-EGFP</italic> under the <italic>armadillo</italic> promoter. Both proteins localize asymmetrically (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B) and rescue the mutant phenotype (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Strutt, 2001</xref>; data not shown). Fz-EYFP is expressed at levels comparable to endogenous Fz (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A), whereas Fmi-EGFP is expressed at low levels that do not significantly increase total Fmi levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>During FRAP, up to 80% of the fluorescence in selected regions was bleached, without apparent detrimental effect on the tissue (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D). To minimize acquisition bleaching, images were collected at 30-s intervals (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>E), and a pixel size of 139 nm was used, at the expense of reduced resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Regions of fixed size enriched for bright fluorescence within apicolateral junctions were manually selected and compared with equivalent-sized regions not containing bright fluorescence. The selected bright regions were highly enriched for puncta and contained on average twice as much Fz-EYFP or Fmi-EGFP fluorescence as the less-bright regions but generally also included a small proportion of less-bright nonpuncta material. Conversely, the less-bright regions may contain small puncta that are below the limit of resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Strikingly, FRAP analysis of both Fz-EYFP and Fmi-EGFP showed that the bright regions within the junctions have a large stable fraction (low recovery) indicating that overall Fmi/Fz turnover is low, whereas the less-bright regions have a significantly smaller stable fraction (more recovery, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4G, and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The remaining stable fraction in less-bright regions is likely to be in part due to the presence of stable accumulations of polarity proteins that are not large enough to be seen as visible puncta. In support of this there is an even smaller stable fraction of Fz-EYFP in anterior-posterior membranes, where no puncta are seen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; p &lt; 0.001 compared to bright and less-bright regions).</p>
        <p>We also investigated the effects of altering the timing and levels of Fz expression. If Fz-EYFP expression was initiated only in larval stages rather than expressed throughout development, although no reproducible change in Fz levels was seen (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A), the stable fraction seen in less-bright regions was slightly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When overall Fz levels were reduced by removing endogenous <italic>fz</italic>, the stable fraction of the less-bright regions decreased further (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>I and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, neither manipulation altered the stable fraction seen in puncta-rich bright regions. From this we conclude that the large stable fraction of Fz-EYFP seen in puncta-rich regions is not sensitive to timing or level of expression, nor is it affected by the presence or absence of endogenous Fz, and so probably reflects the normal behavior of Fz. However, “surplus” Fz can form stable complexes and accumulate in the less-bright regions between puncta.</p>
        <p>Because the appearance of puncta and the degree of core protein asymmetry change over developmental time, we examined whether this correlates with the distribution of the stable fraction of Fz-EYFP. FRAP analysis of cultured prepupal wings showed that the bright regions again have a large stable fraction, whereas the less-bright regions have a smaller stable fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4J, and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, at 20 hr APF, when there is low asymmetry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D), FRAP reveals that a sizeable stable fraction of Fz-EYFP is still present, but this is no longer concentrated in bright regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>K and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>The Unstable Fraction of Fz-EYFP Is Subject to Endocytic Trafficking and Lateral Diffusion</title>
        <p>We next sought to determine if endocytosis and recycling affect the recovery of the unstable fraction of Fz-EYFP in FRAP experiments. We predicted that if unstable material was normally removed from junctions by endocytosis, then expressing dominant-negative dynamin at the restrictive temperature would lead to an accumulation of excess unstable material. Consequently, FRAP analysis would reveal a relatively larger unstable fraction, and this is what we observe in both bright and less-bright regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L).</p>
        <p>However, blocking endocytosis did not cause any measurable change in the rate of recovery of fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L), and this was also true if recycling was blocked (data not shown). A caveat to this result is that the half-life of recovery in both cases is similar to the sampling interval, precluding accurate measurement (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>). Nevertheless, these observations suggest that endocytosis/recycling are not important for the rapid recovery of the unstable fraction and, instead, are consistent with lateral diffusion being the primary mechanism.</p>

        <title>Fmi Is Stabilized at Junctions by the Transmembrane Core Proteins</title>
        <p>Our data so far have demonstrated that a stable population of Fmi and Fz localizes to junctions and is concentrated in puncta. Antibody internalization also reveals a labile population of Fmi in the apical membrane, apparently not associated with Fz or Stbm. We hypothesize that Fmi is normally trafficked to an apical/junctional plasma membrane compartment, where it undergoes rapid endocytosis, and Fz and Stbm serve to stabilize Fmi in the apicolateral junctional region. To test this we measured Fmi internalization in the absence of Stbm, Fz, or both: according to our model, this should cause a progressive increase in the rapidly endocytosed population of Fmi.</p>
        <p>In <italic>stbm</italic> mutant tissue, extracellular Fmi is moderately well localized to junctions, but no clear puncta are present, and there is a slight increase in the apical population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>). Overall, there is more rapid internalization of extracellular Fmi staining in <italic>stbm</italic> compared to wild-type tissue, and a corresponding increase in the number of intracellular Fmi structures (assumed to be endosomes, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A–5D). As in wild-type tissue, apical Fmi is internalized more rapidly than junctional Fmi (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E), indicating that a fraction of Fmi is still being stabilized in junctions. However, the rate of internalization of junctional Fmi in <italic>stbm</italic> is similar to that of nonpuncta Fmi in wild-type (∼80% in 10 min, Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). The absence of a stable protein population concentrated in junctional puncta in <italic>stbm</italic> tissue was confirmed by FRAP: although regions of varying Fz-EYFP brightness can be seen in junctions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F), there is a similar stable fraction regardless of the brightness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Loss of <italic>fz</italic> function causes a more severe loss of extracellular Fmi at junctions and a larger apical population: again, an increase in Fmi internalization was seen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>H–5J and 5N). Comparing the ratio of extracellular Fmi in mutant relative to wild-type tissue indicated that more Fmi was internalized in <italic>fz</italic> mutant tissue than in <italic>stbm</italic> mutant tissue during the first 5 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Q). Again, apical Fmi is internalized more rapidly than junctional Fmi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>O), supporting the idea that Fz and Stbm each play a role in stabilizing Fmi at junctions.</p>
        <p>In tissue lacking both <italic>fz</italic> and <italic>stbm</italic>, where Fmi is almost entirely localized apically, overall Fmi internalization was very rapid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>K–5M and 5P–5R; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>F–S2K; see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>D and S1F–S1H). Notably, the overall internalization is very similar to that of the apical Fmi population alone in wild-type, or in <italic>fz</italic> or <italic>stbm</italic> single mutants (∼60% in 5 min, Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E, 5O, and 5P). Internalization of the apical Fmi occurred most quickly within the first 5 min, but subsequently, extracellular Fmi levels were reduced more slowly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>P), probably because Fmi is already being recycled back to the apical surface: in <italic>fz,stbm</italic> mutant tissue we see colocalization of internalized Fmi vesicles with Rab11, as well as with Rab5 and Rab7 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>J–S3L).</p>
        <p>Although internalization is increased in these mutant backgrounds, overall steady-state levels of Fmi at the cell surface are also increased, suggesting that increased internalization is balanced by increased delivery of Fmi to the plasma membrane. Altering the overall levels of Fmi at junctions does not alter its rate of internalization (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>L), suggesting that the shift from junctional to apical localization, rather than the change in levels, is responsible for increasing Fmi endocytosis.</p>

        <title>Cytoplasmic Core Proteins Are Required for Concentration of Fz/Fmi in Puncta</title>
        <p>We have shown that Fz and Fmi stably localize to junctions, and that Stbm enhances this stability and is also required for concentration of a stable fraction in puncta. We next investigated if the cytoplasmic core proteins have any role in formation of a stable junctional fraction. Puncta are smaller, and core protein asymmetry is reduced in <italic>dgo</italic>, <italic>pk</italic>, and <italic>dsh</italic> mutant backgrounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>N–3Q). This may indicate that the cytoplasmic proteins are required for formation of stable complexes, or alternatively, they may be required for the concentration of stable complexes into puncta.</p>
        <p>We first tested whether cytoplasmic components affect rate of turnover of cell surface Fmi but found no alteration in internalization in <italic>dsh</italic> or <italic>pk</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). Notably, overexpression of any of the cytoplasmic components (Pk, Dsh, and Dgo) causes excess accumulation of the other core proteins in large junctional puncta (<xref rid="bib11 bib33 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Feiguin et al., 2001; Tree et al., 2002; Bastock et al., 2003</xref>), and this causes a reduction in apical Fmi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D) and a small (but significant) reduction in Fmi internalization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C–6E). These results suggest that cytoplasmic proteins do not normally affect turnover of Fmi but when overexpressed can shift an unstable fraction into a stable fraction, concentrated in abnormally large puncta.</p>
        <p>To test for a general role of Pk and Dsh in concentrating proteins in puncta, we carried out FRAP experiments. In <italic>pk</italic> mutants at 28 hr, there is a loss of polarity, and puncta are smaller than in wild-type (Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>O and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F): here, the stable fraction of Fz-EYFP in the bright regions decreases compared to wild-type but is still larger than in the less-bright regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>dsh</italic> mutants have a stronger loss of polarity (see <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>), and the stable fraction in the bright regions decreases further for both Fz-EYFP and Fmi-EGFP at 28 hr (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>G, 6H, 6J, and 6K, and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with an even more pronounced effect at 5.5 hr (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>L).</p>
        <p>Because in <italic>pk</italic> and <italic>dsh</italic> mutants the rate of Fmi internalization is not altered (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B), the decreased stable fraction seen in bright regions upon FRAP in these backgrounds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>I–6L) is unlikely to be due to a change in rate of endocytosis of either stable or unstable fractions of Fmi/Fz. Rather the stable fraction may simply be dispersed within junctions. In support of this, expression of dominant-negative dynamin in a <italic>dsh</italic> mutant caused an additive rather than a synergistic effect on the proportion of unstable Fz-EYFP: there was a slight increase in the unstable fraction in <italic>shi,dsh</italic> tissue, compared with <italic>dsh</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>L and 6M), which was similar to the increase seen in <italic>shi</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L).</p>
        <p>To test directly if the stable fraction was dispersed, we bleached the junctions throughout half a cell and measured the recovery of the entire region. Strikingly, the overall stable fraction of Fz-EYFP was similar in a wild-type and a <italic>dsh</italic> mutant background (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>N). Thus, our data together suggest that the role of the cytoplasmic core proteins is not to generate a stable fraction of Fz/Fmi but to concentrate it within discrete membrane subdomains.</p>

        <title>Asymmetric Protein Complexes and the Establishment of Planar Polarity</title>
        <p>Since the first report over a decade ago of the asymmetric subcellular localization of Fmi in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Usui et al., 1999</xref>), the mechanisms underlying the distribution of the core polarity proteins have been extensively investigated (reviewed in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2009</xref>). A growing number of models have been presented to describe how the core proteins might achieve asymmetric localization (e.g., <xref rid="bib2 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005; Klein and Mlodzik, 2005; Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>), with a common feature being the general assumption that the core proteins assemble together into a stable asymmetric intercellular complex. However, the existence of such a complex is largely inferred from the distributions of the proteins, and the actual roles of individual proteins in the formation, stabilization, and subcellular distribution of such complexes are poorly understood.</p>
        <p>We show here that a fundamental organizing principle for core protein asymmetry is their distribution into discrete plasma membrane subdomains in the apicolateral junctions, which we refer to as “puncta.” Using the independent methodologies of antibody internalization and FRAP, we demonstrate that the populations of Fmi and Fz in puncta are highly persistent, supporting the view that the core polarity proteins do indeed form stable asymmetric complexes, and that these complexes are preferentially clustered together in puncta.</p>
        <p>Our data allow us to make several inferences about the formation of such asymmetric complexes. We previously observed that in the absence of Stbm, an asymmetric Fz-Fmi:Fmi complex was preferentially formed between neighboring cells (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>). Our results suggest that this Fz-Fmi:Fmi complex is the primary building block for the core protein complex. In the absence of Fmi, Fz does not localize to junctions (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Strutt, 2001</xref>), and in the absence of Fz, Fmi is also poorly localized to junctions (<xref rid="bib35 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Usui et al., 1999; Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>) and subject to endocytic turnover (this work). Importantly, loss of other core proteins (Stbm, Pk, Dsh) has less or no effect on Fmi endocytosis, and similarly does not eliminate the stable fraction of Fz, indicating that Fz and Fmi stably localize to junctions in the absence of these factors. Nevertheless, although Stbm does not preferentially form an asymmetric complex with Fmi in the absence of Fz (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>), its ability to further stabilize Fmi at junctions in the presence of Fz indicates an important secondary role in formation of the asymmetric complex.</p>
        <p>Although the cytoplasmic core proteins do not appear to play any role in the formation of stable complexes, they do promote the “clustering” of such complexes into puncta. This is consistent with previous data suggesting that the cytoplasmic factors are not required for intercellular communication but that they have an intracellular function in generating asymmetry (<xref rid="bib30 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2007; Chen et al., 2008</xref>). This absence of a requirement for the cytoplasmic factors in polarized intercellular communication, and the ability of Fz and Fmi to form asymmetric complexes in the absence of Stbm (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>) both suggest that protein complexes are already asymmetric in the absence of clustering.</p>
        <p>Several lines of data suggest that puncta are functionally important for generation of cellular asymmetry. First, they are the major sites of asymmetric localization of the core proteins. Second, their size, and the degree to which they contain a stable faction of Fz, varies over time and correlates with the degree of cellular asymmetry observed. Third, core polarity gene mutations that affect cellular asymmetry to different extents have a corresponding effect on the size of the stable fraction of Fz in puncta.</p>
        <p>The mechanism by which asymmetric complexes are clustered into puncta is unknown. The simplest model is that cytoplasmic factors act as “glue” to hold complexes of the same orientation together and reduce their rates of lateral diffusion in the membrane. The alternative hypothesis that the cytoplasmic factors promote clustering by reducing rates of endocytic turnover is inconsistent with our observation that the overall stable fraction is not altered in the absence of cytoplasmic core protein function. The preference for clustering complexes of the same polarity may also be promoted by inhibitory interactions between proximal and distal complex components (<xref rid="bib33 bib16 bib17 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Tree et al., 2002; Jenny et al., 2003, 2005; Das et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>A key question is how such clustering might lead to the establishment of cellular asymmetry. One possibility is a process of self-organization involving local self-enhancement and longer-range inhibition (<xref rid="bib34 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Turing, 1952; Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>). If planar polarity represents such a self-organizing process, clustering of asymmetric complexes into puncta is likely to provide local enhancement, whereas formation of intrinsically asymmetric complexes between cells may effectively provide longer-range subcellular inhibition that prevents all the clusters within a cell having the same orientation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Meinhardt, 2007</xref>). In support of such self-organization in the pupal wing, we note that induction of Fz, Fmi, or Stbm expression as late as 24 hr APF can lead to locally organized cellular polarity within a few hours (<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Strutt and Strutt, 2002, 2007</xref>) that is not oriented on the PD axis and as such is unlikely to be specified by long-range patterning cues.</p>
        <p>Overall, we propose a model in which molecular asymmetry is initially established by formation of Fz-Fmi:Fmi complexes that are intrinsically stable and in which Fmi endocytosis is attenuated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Entry of Stbm into the complex further promotes Fmi localization to junctions. The cytoplasmic components Dsh, Pk, and Dgo can then be recruited into the complex but do not increase its stability. Instead, they are required for clustering of asymmetric complexes of common polarity into junctional puncta, which are sites of local asymmetry. Through a self-organization process, which would normally be globally biased by an upstream patterning cue, locally organized puncta adopt an asymmetric distribution within the cell, linking the polarity of neighboring cells.</p>

        <title>Puncta and the Remodeling of Planar Polarity</title>
        <p>Our time-lapse experiments indicate that individual puncta are stable for several hours (see also <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, morphogenetic changes such as wing eversion, hinge contraction, and junctional remodeling (<xref rid="bib7 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al., 2005; Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>) necessitate some rearrangement of junctions, and this appears to be accompanied by reduced puncta size and loss of cellular asymmetry. Interestingly, although during junctional remodeling (at 20 hr APF), brighter regions are still visible in the junctions, our FRAP experiments reveal that these regions are no longer enriched for the stable fraction of Fz. This suggests that the membrane subdomains in which puncta form may be persistent, but the mechanisms that promote accumulation of asymmetric complexes in puncta are not active. This may allow the remodeling of planar polarity, following morphogenetic changes.</p>
        <p>Transient asymmetric localization of polarity proteins is also seen in more dynamic systems, for example in vertebrate gastrulation (<xref rid="bib6 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ciruna et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2008</xref>), where their distribution is also highly punctate. It is possible that in cells that are undergoing movement and changing their contacts, local organization of polarity proteins into puncta allows more rapid reestablishment of polarized interactions between neighboring cells.</p>

        <p>APF pupae were aged at 25°C and dissected half an hour before imaging, adapting the method of <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al. (2008)</xref>. A small piece of cuticle was removed from above the developing wing, and the pupa was inverted and mounted in a drop of Halocarbon 700 oil in a glass-bottomed dish (Iwaki). Pupae were retained after imaging, and &gt;95% eclose, suggesting minimal tissue damage. Prepupal wings were dissected in SM/FBS (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Classen et al., 2008</xref>) and placed in a glass-bottomed dish with ∼20 μl of SM/FCS surrounded by a gasket of parafilm. A round coverslip was then placed on top, and a ring of wet paper tissue was added to prevent evaporation. Alternatively, wings were placed in ∼5 μl SM/FCS containing 1% methylcellulose on a slide surrounded by Sellotape Diamond tape. A round coverslip was then placed on top and nail varnish applied to prevent evaporation—in this case, samples were imaged no more than 1 hr after dissection. FRAP analysis of trafficking mutants was carried out in prepupal wings because pupal wing tissue was unhealthy under the same conditions. Wild-type and mutant tissue from the same wings was analyzed.</p>
        <p>Samples were imaged on an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, with a Zeiss 63× NA 1.4 oil apochromatic objective lens at 2× zoom with the pinhole open to maximize light detected. The 488 nm Argon laser was used at an output of 20%, and a 505–550 nm band-pass filter was used for detection. Single images with no averaging were taken to reduce acquisition bleaching.</p>
        <p>For FRAP, plasma membrane regions containing concentrated Fz-EYFP (bright regions) or diffuse Fz-EYFP (less-bright regions) were selected and bleached, using the 488 nm Argon laser at 100% and passing 20 times over a region of interest (ROI) of 2 μm<sup>2</sup>—this is smaller than half of the distal membrane in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing cell and about twice as large as a typical punctum at 28 hr APF. The size of the ROI could not be reduced because tissue movement makes the ROI hard to track over time. No laser bleaching occurs outside the ROI, indicating that loss of fluorescence outside the ROI (but within the same cell) and rapid recovery inside the ROI are likely to be due to lateral protein diffusion (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>F and S5G).</p>
        <p>Three prebleach images were captured, as well as an immediate post-bleach image, and then an image was taken every 30 s for up to 40 min. Faster image acquisition was attempted, but this led to increased acquisition bleaching (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>E).</p>
        <p>For data analysis, Volocity (v.4.4 Improvision) was used to manually reselect and quantify the fluorescence of at least ten of the 2 μm<sup>2</sup> bleached regions at each time point, and laser-off background was subtracted. To measure acquisition bleaching, readings were collected from each of four bright and less-bright nonbleached control regions, 2 μm<sup>2</sup> in size, at least two cells away. Data were then corrected for acquisition bleaching and normalized against an average of the prebleached values. Data were plotted on an XY graph in Prism (v.5 GraphPad), and a one-phase exponential association curve was fitted. An extra sum-of-squares F test was performed to compare curve plateaux (Y<sup>max</sup>). Note that in most cases, the half-life of recovery was less than the acquisition interval (30 s), and thus, the rate of recovery could not be accurately determined.</p>

        <title>Imaging and Analysis of Puncta</title>
        <p>For analyzing puncta size and intensity, samples were fixed, antibody stained, and imaged at maximum resolution (pixel size 47 nm), using identical settings. The <italic>intermode</italic> algorithm in ImageJ was used to select a suitable threshold value, which was then applied uniformly to all images being compared. The <italic>particle analysis</italic> tool was then used to define puncta with diameter larger than 240 nm, and to calculate the mean intensity and size of puncta. These conditions correctly identified all puncta that could be seen by eye but did not highlight endosomes, which were below the size cutoff. For antibody internalization a set threshold and particle size was selected for the 0-min images, and applied across images for later time points. Mean intensity, size, and number of puncta were determined. Nonpuncta junctional regions and apical regions were selected manually, and the mean intensity was measured.</p>
        <p>For determining asymmetry in <italic>fz-EYFP</italic> and <italic>stbm-EYFP</italic> mosaics, puncta and nonpuncta regions on proximal and distal membranes were selected manually using Fmi staining. The mean intensity of GFP staining in regions of a fixed size was then determined.</p>

        <p>(A) Fmi (red) localized apically or laterally is rapidly endocytosed (black arrows), unless it is in an asymmetric junctional complex with Fz (green) or Fz and Stbm (orange). (B) Cytoplasmic proteins Dsh and Dgo (purple and pale blue) or Pk (dark blue) are incorporated into asymmetric complexes, and promote local clustering of complexes of the same orientation by either attractive homophilic interactions or repulsive heterophilic interactions (blue lines and arrows). (C) Locally organized clusters of asymmetric complexes form distinct “puncta” in cell-cell junctions. Cellular asymmetry may be promoted by self-organization of asymmetric complexes within the cell. Individual puncta containing complexes of common polarity increase in size by recruiting further complexes of the same polarity and/or repelling complexes of opposite polarity, leading to local self-enhancement of asymmetric protein distribution (blue arrows). Because intercellular complexes are intrinsically asymmetric, local self-enhancement of Fz clustering in one cell leads to a corresponding enhancement of Stbm clustering in the neighboring cell. This coupled clustering acts as a form of long-range intercellular inhibition (red bars), ensuring that within each cell, domains containing high concentrations of both Fz and Stbm form. Global orientation of such clusters relative to the axes of the tissue is specified by long-range cues, such as distal transport of Fz-containing vesicles (center of cell; <xref rid="bib26 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al.
