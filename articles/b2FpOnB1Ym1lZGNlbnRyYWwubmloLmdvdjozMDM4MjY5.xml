      <abstract>
        <p>The previously identified <italic>spoIIS</italic> locus encodes a toxin–antitoxin system in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. It comprises two genes, s<italic>poIISA</italic> encoding a toxin and s<italic>poIISB</italic> encoding an antitoxin, which lies adjacent to each other on the chromosome. Each of the <italic>spoIIS</italic> coding sequences is preceded by a promoter region and the two genes together constitute an operon. The function of SpoIISA is unknown, although it has been shown that the absence of SpoIISB or loss of its function leads to a block in sporulation at stage II. The cytoplasmic membrane has been proposed as the target of the SpoIISA toxin. Heterologously expressed SpoIISA–SpoIISB was shown to be functional in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, where again the cytoplasmic membrane was the most probable target for SpoIISA toxicity. Here we analyzed the effects of SpoIISA production during vegetative growth of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and during sporulation by following the levels of SpoIISA. SpoIISA levels increase at the point of entry into stationary phase of cell cultures grown in sporulation-inducing medium. However, SpoIISA expression appears to be unrelated to the sporulation process, since it is independent of the major early sporulation-specific transcription factor, Spo0A.</p>
        <p>We also investigated SpoIISA localization within the cell. We confirmed the predicted localization of SpoIISA at the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, we observed localization of SpoIISA in higher level structures in a cell-wall-dependent manner.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Programmed cell death (PCD) as a process of genetically regulated cell suicide has importance in eukaryotes, but there is growing evidence that PCD also plays a significant role in developmental processes in bacteria (<xref rid="bib7 bib12 bib20 bib31 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Doyle and Koch, 1987; Foster, 1992; Kuroda et al., 1993; Rosenbluh and Rosenberg, 1989; Mueller and Dworkin, 1991</xref>). Some of the proteins which are thought to elicit PCD in bacteria belong to the family of addiction modules, also known as toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems. TA systems, which generally consist of stable toxin and labile antitoxin, were first discovered on low copy plasmids of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, where they are responsible for the phenomenon of post-segregational killing in plasmid-free cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Engelberg-Kulka and Glaser, 1999</xref>). Subsequently, a large number of homologues of plasmid-encoded TA systems have been found on the chromosomes of bacteria (<xref rid="bib25 bib2 bib13 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Masuda et al., 1993; Aizenman et al., 1996; Gotfredsen and Gerdes, 1998; Mittenhuber, 1999</xref>) and Archaea (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Gerdes, 2005</xref>). TA systems are generally divided into two groups that differ in the mechanism of toxin inactivation; in type I systems, the toxin is neutralized by inhibition of its translation, where small antisense RNA acts as an antitoxin; in type II systems, both the toxin and the antitoxin are proteins and the toxin is inactivated by binding to its antidote (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hayes, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>spoIIS</italic> is a chromosomally encoded TA system in the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. It is composed of two genes, <italic>spoIISA</italic> and <italic>spoIISB</italic>, constituting an operon which resembles type II TA systems. SpoIISA toxin consists of 248 amino acid residues; the first third of the protein contains three putative transmembrane segments and the protein is predicted to lie in the cytoplasmic membrane. The C-terminal two-thirds of the protein are predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. The SpoIISB antitoxin, consisting of 56 amino acid residues, is a small cytosolic protein that neutralizes the lethal effect of SpoIISA by forming a SpoIISA–SpoIISB complex (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies revealed that the cytoplasmic membrane could be the target of the toxic action of SpoIISA. The effect of SpoIISA overexpression in the absence of the SpoIISB antidote has been studied both in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, large plasmolysis zones and holes in the peptidoglycan layer were observed in cells with complete or incomplete septa, suggesting that the SpoIISA toxin could act as a holin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). The disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane was also seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Florek et al., 2008</xref>). It was also shown that intact SpoIISA is integral to cell killing activity, since neither the cytosolic region nor the transmembrane domain alone can exert a toxic effect (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Florek et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previous genetic analysis identified mutations in the <italic>spoIIS</italic> locus that affect sporulation of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). Sporulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is a developmental process triggered by nutrient deprivation, which starts with asymmetric cell division and leads to formation of dormant spores (<xref rid="bib30 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Piggot and Coote, 1976; Losick and Stragier, 1992</xref>). The process of spore formation is divided into seven principal stages associated with characteristic morphological changes: polar septum formation, engulfment of the forespore, formation of the cortex and spore coat, maturation of the spore and lysis of the mother cell (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Errington, 2003</xref>). Mutations in SpoIISA or in SpoIISB as well as deletion of SpoIISB cause a block of sporulation after septum formation at stage II. However, deletion of <italic>spoIISA</italic> alone or deletion of the whole locus does not affect sporulation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Adler and colleagues also identified two promoters in the <italic>spoIIS</italic> locus; the first drives transcription of both genes, while the second directs expression of <italic>spoIISB</italic> alone. Analysis of P<italic><sub>AB</sub></italic> and P<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> promoter activity using <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions revealed that the P<italic><sub>AB</sub></italic> promoter is weaker than the P<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> promoter and both are σ<sup>A</sup>-dependent promoters (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). However, subsequent analyses showed that expression of <italic>spoIISA</italic> may be transcribed by RNA polymerase containing later-acting sporulation sigma factor σ<sup>K</sup>, which controls expression of genes 3–4 h after the onset of sporulation (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Steil et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The physiological role of SpoIISA and the conditions under which it is expressed are unknown. Here, using western blot analysis, we monitored the levels of SpoIISA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> during its life cycle. Our results show that SpoIISA is present in cells during stationary phase of growth and during the early stages of sporulation. We measured SpoIISA levels in different growth media, revealing that the toxin is present in higher amounts when cells were grown in sporulation medium compared to LB medium. We confirmed the presence of SpoIISA in a <italic>spo0A</italic> mutant of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, indicating that activation of expression of the toxin is independent of sporulation sigma factors. Using GFP fused to the transmembrane domain of SpoIISA, we demonstrate that the SpoIISA protein is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>

Ampicillin (100 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and chloramphenicol (40 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) were used for plasmid selection in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and kanamycin (10 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and spectinomycin (100 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) were used for selecting transformants harboring plasmids integrated into the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome.

        <p>Employing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain PY79 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Youngman et al., 1984</xref>) genomic DNA as a template, primer pairs PfrIISAS/PfrIISAA and PfrIISBS/PfrIISBA were used for PCR amplification of a 572 bp long sequence upstream of <italic>spoIISA</italic> and a 624 bp long sequence downstream of <italic>spoIISB</italic>, respectively. Resulting PCR products were cloned into EcoRI/BamHI and PstI/HindIII sites of pUS19, respectively, creating the pUS19-FRIIS plasmid. A fragment encoding resistance to kanamycin was PCR-amplified from the pUK19 plasmid (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 1998</xref>) using primers PKnS/PKnA and subsequently cloned into PstI/BamHI sites of pUS19-FRIIS to obtain the pUS19-ΔIIS plasmid.

After overnight incubation, one colony from each transformant subculture outgrown on non-selective LB plate was again streaked onto both non-selective and selective LB plates. The procedure was repeated 7 times with colonies outgrown on non-selective LB plates streaked onto both selective and non-selective plates. The subculture was defined as an overnight formation of a single colony corresponding to about 25 generations. The number of these discontinuous subcultures outgrown on selective medium was normalized to the number of subcultures outgrown on non-selective medium and was calculated in percentage.

        <title>Analysis of SpoIISA accumulation during the life cycle of <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title>
        <p>SpoIISA toxin was first identified as a protein which, when produced in the absence of SpoIISB, is able to block sporulation at stage II. Despite the implied role in sporulation, one study showed that both <italic>spoIIS</italic> genes are transcribed during vegetative growth, with the highest expression levels being achieved approximately at the time of the onset of sporulation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). A more recent transcriptional profiling analysis indicated that expression of the <italic>spoIISA</italic> gene might be under the control of σ<sup>K</sup>, the latest-acting of the sporulation sigma factors (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Steil et al., 2005</xref>). To examine the possibility that SpoIISA could in some way be involved in sporulation, we monitored SpoIISA levels during different phases of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> life cycle. According to the assumption that SpoIISA is a membrane protein (our further results showed that SpoIISA is indeed a membrane protein), we prepared membrane fractions of cells (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Material and methods</xref>) following growth in different media. SpoIISA was detected by western blot analysis using anti-SpoIISA antibodies. Initially, cells were grown in Difco sporulation medium (DSM) from which the onset of sporulation was assigned according to the growth curve. Samples were taken and analyzed at different times during growth and sporulation. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, the cells started to produce SpoIISA protein during the exponential phase of growth; however, a substantial increase in production of the toxin was observed approximately at the point of initiation of the sporulation process (5 h after inoculation). The peak of SpoIISA accumulation was detected during the 1<sup>st</sup> 2 h of sporulation (7 h after inoculation); however we did not observe any signal corresponding to SpoIISA after the 4<sup>th</sup> h of sporulation (9 h after inoculation). The absence of SpoIISA could be explained by the fact that our method is not optimal for the detection of membrane proteins, particularly in the later stages of sporulation, despite whether total cells or only membrane fractions were used for analysis. Subsequently we sought to determine whether SpoIISA expression was dependent on initiation of sporulation. For this, we used a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain with a deletion in <italic>spo0A</italic> which is unable to sporulate (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ireton et al., 1993</xref>) and in which sporulation is blocked at stage 0, prior to asymmetric division (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Levin and Losick, 1996</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B demonstrates that SpoIISA is present in the IB220 strain (<italic>spo0A</italic> null mutant), grown in DSM, from the beginning of stationary phase (the 5<sup>th</sup> h of growth) to the 9<sup>th</sup> h of growth when the cells begin to lyse. Since the overall amount of SpoIISA is higher in the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) than in the <italic>spo0A</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), there is a possibility that Spo0A plays some role in SpoIISA expression. On the other hand, the explanation for these observations could be that SpoIISA turnover is faster in Spo0A-depleted cells than in the wild-type cells and therefore we see the stronger signal for SpoIISA in the latter.</p>
        <p>Our results concerning the timing of SpoIISA production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) are consistent with previous observations of <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al. (2001)</xref>, although we still cannot exclude the possibility that SpoIISA plays some role during the later stages of sporulation. It is quite conceivable that SpoIISA may accelerate mother cell putrefaction and thus facilitate the release of the mature spore into the environment, at the same time rendering scarce nutrients for use by kin cells, so as to complete their own sporulation process or to sustain growth of non-sporulating cells.</p>
        <p>We next examined how SpoIISA is produced in the non-sporulation medium, LB, where we expected the same profile of SpoIISA accumulation as in DSM medium. However, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, we observed a very weak SpoIISA signal during all 8 h of growth in LB medium. When we compared the signal intensities from cells grown in LB and DSM, respectively, we observed a similar amount of SpoIISA in both media only at the 3<sup>rd</sup> h of growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D). Thereafter, there was an approximately one order of magnitude increase in the signal after 5 h growth for cells in DSM. It appears that the cellular SpoIISA concentration somehow depends on the composition of the media. We therefore tested the influence of various combinations of the five salts present in DSM on expression of SpoIISA in cells grown in LB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We obtained a very weak SpoIISA signal when KCl and MgSO<sub>4</sub> were added (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> lane 2), weaker than in LB alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> lane 1). On the other hand, when 1 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 10 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 μM FeSO<sub>4</sub> were added (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> lane 3), the SpoIISA signal was almost as strong as in DSM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 7). The other combination of salts added to LB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, lanes 4 and 5) increased the signal compared to LB without any salts, but did not overcome the signal when only MnCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 6). Taken together, these results indicate that KCl and MgSO<sub>4</sub> decrease the level of SpoIISA while, on the other hand, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub> and FeSO<sub>4</sub> increase the amount of SpoIISA in the cells. Currently, we cannot predict the mechanism by which expression of the SpoIISA toxin is influenced by MnCl<sub>2</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and FeSO<sub>4</sub> salts.</p>

        <title>Analysis of SpoIISB during the life cycle of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells</title>
        <p>SpoIISB production during the life cycle of wild type <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells in DSM media was monitored. Under these conditions, we were unable to detect SpoIISB using a standard western blot method, which was used for analysis of SpoIISA toxin. There exists the possibility that SpoIISB is rapidly turned over; however, it was shown previously that SpoIISB can be detected with a SpoIISB antibody when the protein is overexpressed in both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (unpublished data) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Florek et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

        <title>Localization of SpoIISA</title>
        <p>SpoIISA is predicted to be associated through its three putative transmembrane domains with the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2001</xref>). We investigated this prediction using western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy.</p>
        <p>Immunoblotting analysis of cell membrane and cytosolic fractions revealed the presence of SpoIISA signals exclusively in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> membrane fractions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; lanes 1, 3, 5), establishing that SpoIISA is anchored in the cell membrane.</p>
        <p>To confirm this finding, we sought to determine the in vivo localization of SpoIISA C-terminally fused to GFP using fluorescence microscopy. The observed green fluorescence signal was distributed throughout the cells and subsequent western blot analysis of total cell fractions showed that this signal corresponded to free GFP and not to the SpoIISA-GFP function protein (data not shown). One possible explanation for this observation is that GFP mRNA was transcribed from the P<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> promoter, which is responsible for expression of the <italic>spoIISB</italic> gene. To prevent expression of GFP from the P<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> promoter, we prepared a fusion of the N-terminal region of SpoIISA (N-IISA), including the transmembrane segments, with GFP. This construct was cloned into vector pUS19 and the localization of the fusion protein (N-IISA-GFP) was investigated. Even though the presence of N-IISA-GFP was detected at the beginning of stationary phase on immunoblots (data not shown), fluorescent microscopy revealed only a background signal in cells. Thus we conclude that probably only low amounts of N-IISA-GFP are produced under these conditions from the P<italic><sub>AB</sub></italic> promoter.</p>
        <p>To increase the fluorescence signal, we cloned DNA encoding the first 86 amino acid residues corresponding to the transmembrane region of SpoIISA downstream from a xylose-inducible promoter into vector pSG1154 forming strain IB1237 (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). This time, when the fusion protein was overexpressed, we observed quite strong fluorescence signals which appeared to be associated with the cell membrane and forming distinct foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Subsequently, we investigated strain IB1073, in which GFP alone was placed under control of the P<italic><sub>xyl</sub></italic> promoter (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In this instance, the GFP signal was exclusively associated with the cytoplasm without foci formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C) These results, together with immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody, proved that the fusion protein does not undergo significant degradation (data not shown) and is present in the cell membrane fractions. This observation confirms that SpoIISA is anchored in the cell membrane via its transmembrane parts. We next prepared protoplasts of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells expressing the N-IISA-GFP fusion protein. We observed fluorescent signals throughout the cell membrane with no foci apparent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). The determinants of foci are not known, though they may be inherent in SpoIISA. However, the absence of foci in protoplasts suggests that their formation and/or stabilization could be influenced either by peptidoglycan or another component present in the cell wall.</p>

        <title>The spoIIS locus does not act as an addiction system in <italic>E. coli</italic></title>
        <p>SpoIIS systems are present on chromosomes of many Bacillus species; however, their biological role is not clear. To further investigate the function of the SpoIIS system, we tested its possible involvement in plasmid stabilization by postsegregation killing (PSK). This phenomenon requires that the toxin component has a longer cellular half-life than the antitoxin. In these instances, bacteria become addicted to continuous expression of the antitoxin and consequently there is plasmid retention by the cells. PSK could not be observed in vegetatively growing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, as they are immune to the activity of SpoIISA; therefore, we tested possibility that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the presence of the <italic>spoIIS</italic> locus might increase the stability of the plasmid that harbors it. If the SpoIISAB module functions as a PSK system, it would be expected that the rate of loss of the plasmid bearing the TA module would be lower than the rate of loss of the parental plasmid. On the other hand, if cells shed the plasmid bearing the TA locus faster than or at the same rate as they shed the parental plasmid, this would suggest that the toxin is less stable than the antitoxin or that the stability of both proteins is similar.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, the number of cells retaining plasmid pACYC-IISAB declines in the population considerably faster than those retaining the empty parental plasmid (pACYC184). These results indicate that the SpoIIS system does not function as an addiction module through PSK in <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, it was observed previously that the SpoIISA protein is degraded in <italic>E. coli</italic> by the activity of some proteases (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Florek et al., 2008</xref>), which can prevent functioning of the SpoIIS system as an addiction module in this microorganism.</p>
