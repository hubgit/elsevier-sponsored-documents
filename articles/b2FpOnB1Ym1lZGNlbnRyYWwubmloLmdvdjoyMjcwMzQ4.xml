        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Apoptotic death of T lymphocytes is critical for shutdown of immune responses and hemopoietic cell homeostasis. Both death receptor (Fas) activation and mitochondrial apoptosis triggered by the BH3-only protein Bim have been implicated in the killing of antigen-stimulated T cells. We examined mice lacking the gene encoding Bim (<italic>Bcl2l11</italic>) and with the inactivating lpr mutation in the gene encoding Fas (<italic>Fas</italic>), designated <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice. Shutdown of an acute T cell response to herpes simplex virus involved only Bim with no contribution by Fas, whereas both pathways synergized in killing antigen-stimulated T cells in chronic infection with murine γ-herpesvirus. <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice developed remarkably enhanced and accelerated fatal lymphadenopathy and autoimmunity compared to mice lacking only one of these apoptosis inducers. These results identify critical overlapping roles for Fas and Bim in T cell death in immune response shutdown and prevention of immunopathology and thereby resolve a long-standing controversy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In response to infection or immunization, T cells that express antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCR) become activated and proliferate, and some differentiate into effector cells (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). Activated T cells then produce cytokines that help coordinate the immune response aimed at eliminating the pathogen. Clearance of the antigen is accompanied by the shutdown of T cell immune responses and involves apoptosis of a large fraction of antigen-activated T cells. This prevents accumulation of no-longer-needed and potentially dangerous effector cells and thereby precludes immunopathology. Two distinct but ultimately converging pathways control apoptosis initiation in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Strasser et al., 1995</xref>). Ligation of “death receptors,” members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family with an intracellular “death domain” (e.g., Fas or the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNF-R1]) triggers formation of the “death-inducing signaling complex” (DISC), which promotes cell demolition through activation of caspase-8 (<xref rid="bib1 bib19 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998; Krammer, 2000; Wallach et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, the “mitochondrial” (also called “intrinsic” or “B cell lymphoma [Bcl-2]-regulated”) apoptotic pathway, activated by developmental cues or cytotoxic stimuli, such as cytokine deprivation, is independent of caspase-8 and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), but instead involves mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which promotes Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9 (<xref rid="bib13 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Green and Kroemer, 2004; Wang, 2001</xref>). This pathway is controlled by the Bcl-2 protein family, which consists of three subgroups: the Bcl-2-like prosurvival proteins essential for cell survival; the Bax and Bak-like proteins required for mitochondrial outer membrane disruption, release of apoptogenic proteins (e.g., cytochrome c), and activation of the caspase cascade (<xref rid="bib13 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Green and Kroemer, 2004; Wang, 2001</xref>); and the proteins containing only the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3-only proteins, e.g., Bim), which are activated by distinct death stimuli and are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Strasser, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both death receptor signaling and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway have been shown to be critical for lymphocyte homeostasis (<xref rid="bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). Mice (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992</xref>) or humans (ALPS, autoimmune lymphoproliferation syndrome patients) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rieux-Laucat et al., 1995</xref>) defective for Fas (<italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice) or its ligand, FasL (<italic>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></italic> mice), develop progressive lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly resulting from accumulation of excess mature T and B cells as well as “unusual” αβTCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> T cells. Bcl-2-deficient mice (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Veis et al., 1993</xref>) and mice lacking myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) in the hematopoietic system (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Opferman et al., 2005</xref>) exhibit profound lymphopenia, whereas mice overexpressing a Bcl-2 transgene throughout the hematopoietic compartment show marked lymphadenopathy (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ogilvy et al., 1999</xref>). Mice lacking the BH3-only protein Bim also accumulate excess lymphocytes and myeloid cells and these cells are abnormally resistant to cytokine deprivation, deregulated calcium flux, and ER stress (<xref rid="bib2 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999; Puthalakath et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, Bim is critical for apoptosis during negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 2002</xref>), mature T cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Davey et al., 2002</xref>), and B cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Enders et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The relative contributions of the two distinct apoptotic pathways in the termination of T cell immune responses has been a matter of controversy for a long time. FasL and Fas have been implicated because activation-induced cell death (AICD), an in vitro model in which mitogen-activated T cell blasts are killed by TCR restimulation, which causes FasL upregulation, is inhibited by FasL or Fas inactivation (<xref rid="bib4 bib6 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 1995; Dhein et al., 1995; Russell et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, clearance of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> Enterotoxin B (SEB)-activated TCR Vβ8<sup>+</sup> T cells was reported to depend partially on Fas (<xref rid="bib21 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mogil et al., 1995; Van Parijs et al., 1996</xref>). The mitochondrial pathway has been implicated in immune response shutdown, because Bcl-2 overexpression (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Strasser et al., 1991</xref>), loss of Bim (<xref rid="bib15 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002; Pellegrini et al., 2003</xref>), or Bax and Bak deficiency (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Rathmell et al., 2002</xref>) inhibited death of T cells stimulated in vitro or in vivo by a single dose of SEB or in vivo after infection with human herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). It is conceivable that Fas and Bim may have overlapping roles in T cell killing, with their relative contribution determined by the nature of the immune response (acute versus chronic). In acute immune responses, apoptosis is triggered by the drop in cytokine amounts, after clearance of the pathogen or injected immunogen (<xref rid="bib15 bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002; Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). A single administration of SEB, which is known to be eliminated quickly from the body (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Vabulas et al., 1996</xref>), would therefore mimic an acute infection. In contrast, TCR restimulation of activated T cells in vitro (AICD) or repeated administration of SEB to mice is more likely to imitate the repeated TCR activation that is thought to occur during chronic immune responses, such as persistent infections or stimulation with self-antigens (<xref rid="bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The removal of effector T lymphocytes prevents immunopathology, but the mechanisms for apoptosis induction remain contentious (<xref rid="bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). In the present study, we have generated mice lacking Bim and harboring the inactivating lpr mutation in the <italic>Fas</italic> gene, and we used acute and chronic viral infection models to decipher the individual and combined roles of Fas and Bim in the shutdown of T cell immune responses and in immunopathology.</p>

        <p>To investigate the functional interaction of Bim and Fas in the control of lymphocyte homeostasis, we generated mice lacking both of these apoptosis inducers (with both parental strains backcrossed to C57BL/6 &gt;20 generations prior to intercrossing). Bim is required for the killing of lymphocytes induced by growth factor withdrawal, deregulated calcium flux, DNA damage, or treatment with dexamethasone (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Bcl2l11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> thymocytes are, however, normally sensitive to treatment with phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA, a death stimulus that can be countered by Bcl-2 overexpression) or FasL, which triggers the death receptor pathway (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>). To determine the consequences of the combined mutations on cell survival, we sorted several lymphocyte populations and subjected them in culture to cytokine deprivation, treatment with FasL, the calcium ionophore ionomycin, PMA, or the DNA damage-inducing drug etoposide. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) as well as mature B cells (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>E–S1G available online) and T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and αβTCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>) from <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice were resistant to both FasL as well as Bim-dependent apoptotic stimuli, such as growth factor withdrawal or treatment with ionomycin. Thymocytes remained, however, normally sensitive to PMA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), which was shown to require the BH3-only protein Puma for cell killing (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Villunger et al., 2003</xref>). These results demonstrate that Fas signaling and Bim exert nonredundant roles in the apoptosis of hemopoietic cells.</p>

        <title>Clearance of HSV-Specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells in Acute Infection Requires the BH3-Only Protein Bim but Is Fas Independent</title>
        <p>Although the importance of Fas and Bim in lymphocyte homeostasis is widely accepted, their respective roles in immune response shutdown remain controversial (<xref rid="bib15 bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002; Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). We addressed the existing controversy by measuring the numbers of antigen-stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen and lymph nodes during acute and chronic immune responses in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> as well as <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>+/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic>, <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic>, <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and WT mice (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A–2D and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–3D). Consistent with the acute nature of an HSV-1 (HSV1 KOS) infection and the ensuing immune response (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrini et al., 2003</xref>), all mice were able to clear the virus rapidly (not shown). Previous studies have shown that the number of HSV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen of WT and <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice peaks at day 7, after which the majority of these effectors are eliminated by cell death (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrini et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, flow cytometric analysis showed that the spleens of WT and <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice contained only low numbers (&lt;10<sup>6</sup>) of HSV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on days 17 and 35 after HSV infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). In contrast, in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, the numbers of HSV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen did not fall substantially after pathogen clearance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Notably, the additional loss of Fas (in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice) did not further increase the accumulation of viral antigen-stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). HSV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cell numbers were also similar in nonlymphoid tissues (lungs and liver) of <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice 17 and 35 days after infection with HSV-1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). These results demonstrate that Fas activation, which requires repeated TCR stimulation to upregulate FasL in T cells, is not involved in the shutdown of acute immune responses; instead, this death is mediated predominantly by Bim.</p>

        <title>Bim and Fas Cooperate to Eliminate MHV-OVA-Specific T Cells in Chronic Infection</title>
        <p>Both mitochondrial as well as Fas-mediated apoptosis have been hypothesized to mediate the death of CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic antigenic stimulation (<xref rid="bib19 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krammer, 2000; Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). We therefore examined the individual and combined roles of Bim and Fas in the T cell immune response to mouse γ-herpes virus (MHV) transgenically expresssing ovalbumin (MHV 68-OVA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This virus causes a chronic infection predominantly in the lung and B cells, with persistent antigen presentation in the lung (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Rajcani and Kudelova, 2005</xref>). Total numbers of leukocytes as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were determined 14, 40, and 60 days after infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3D). Surface staining for viral antigen (ovalbumin)-specific TCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F) or intracellular staining for IFN-γ production after brief antigenic (ovalbumin) stimulation in culture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G and 3H) demonstrated that in spleens and draining lymph nodes of WT mice, MHV-OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (undetectable prior to infection) were greatly expanded on days 14 and 40 after infection, followed by a loss of nearly 50% of these cells by day 60. Loss of Bim resulted in a significant (p &lt; 0.05), albeit relatively small, increase in MHV-OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on days 40 and 60, which was particularly prominent in the spleen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3G). Fas-deficient mice contained similarly increased numbers of these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3G; p &lt; 0.05). Remarkably, the combined absence of both apoptosis inducers had dramatic effects, causing a 43- or 63-fold increase of MHV-OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen compared to WT mice on days 40 and 60, respectively. The increase of MHV-OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes was even more spectacular, with an 83- or 845-fold difference compared to WT mice observed on days 40 and 60, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>F and 3H). This preferential increase of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the draining lymph nodes might be a consequence of the ongoing antigen release from the lungs resulting in lymphocyte homing to this site. These results demonstrate that Fas-mediated death receptor signaling and the Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway cooperate to prevent deregulated expansion of activated T cells during chronic antigenic stimulation.</p>

        <p>Loss of either Bim or Fas both lead to marked lymphadenopathy. Whereas <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice show an increase in most lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in the periphery (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>), lymphadenopathy in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice is due in large part to the accumulation of unusual αβTCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992</xref>). These unusual T cells are not found in WT or <italic>Bcl2l11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> and even <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>+/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice developed lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly at a dramatically increased magnitude and rate compared to mice lacking either apoptosis initiator alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Immune responses to an infectious pathogen or injection of a foreign substance result in the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells and, upon pathogen or antigen clearance, this is followed by contraction of this T cell population (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sprent and Tough, 2001</xref>). The shutdown of T cell immune responses is mediated by their programmed death (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kawabe and Ochi, 1991</xref>), but the mechanisms for apoptosis induction remain controversial (<xref rid="bib15 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002; Krammer, 2000</xref>). This is (at least in part) due to the use of different model systems. Culturing antigen- or mitogen-activated T cells with IL-2 and restimulating them through the TCR or with PMA plus ionomycin has long been used as the standard in vitro model to mimic the removal of activated T cells in vivo (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Krammer, 2000</xref>). Experiments with blocking antibodies or FasL- or Fas-deficient mutant mice demonstrated that in this setting, TCR restimulation causes the expression of FasL, which induces autocrine and/or paracrine killing of Fas-expressing T cells (<xref rid="bib4 bib6 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 1995; Dhein et al., 1995; Russell et al., 1993</xref>). This led to the conclusion that FasL-Fas signaling is responsible for the shutdown of T cell immune responses. Some studies showed that deletion of SEB-activated T cells in mice was in part FasL-Fas dependent (<xref rid="bib21 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mogil et al., 1995; Renno et al., 1996</xref>), whereas others found that Fas deficiency (in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mutant mice) had no impact but that loss of Bim provided profound protection (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002</xref>). These discrepancies might be due to differences in the regimes of SEB injection. This is supported by the finding that effects of Fas deficiency on deletion of activated T cells in vivo were observed most consistently when mice were administered several doses of SEB (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Strasser et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, the death of antigen-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during shutdown of and acute immune response to a viral (HSV-1) infection was substantially inhibited by loss of Bim but was not affected by Fas deficiency (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrini et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore reasoned that depending on the nature of an immune response—acute versus chronic—Fas-mediated death receptor signaling and Bim-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis might contribute to different extents to the killing of activated T cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Strasser and Pellegrini, 2004</xref>). Accordingly, a single low-dose challenge with SEB would mimic a response to an acute infection, whereas high-dose and/or repeated challenge with this superantigen would be expected to resemble the response to a chronic infection.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice demonstrates that killing of activated T cells during termination of a response to acute infection relies predominantly on Bim with no apparent contribution by Fas death receptor signaling. In contrast, these two pathways synergize in the killing of T cells during shutdown of an immune response to chronic infection, and they also cooperate to maintain homeostasis of T cells, B cells, as well as granulocytes, and to prevent autoimmune pathology. These results help reconcile current controversies regarding the relative contributions of the death receptor versus the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to the shutdown of T cell immune responses. They are consistent with the notion that during shutdown of an acute immune response, killing of activated T cells is not elicited by repeated TCR ligation, which would have been required for activation of the Fas pathway (<xref rid="bib15 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002; Pellegrini et al., 2003</xref>). Instead, apoptosis requires the BH3-only protein Bim, which is thought to be activated by the drop in cytokine levels that occurs after pathogen clearance (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Strasser and Pellegrini, 2004</xref>). This fits with the observations that Bim is critical for cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>) and transcriptionally (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dijkers et al., 2000</xref>) as well as post-translationally (reviewed in <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ley et al., 2005</xref>) activated by this death stimulus. It is possible that a drop in the levels of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, particularly Bcl-2 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hildeman et al., 2002</xref>), and/or the induction of the BH3-only protein Puma (encoded by the <italic>Bbc3</italic> gene), which is also involved in growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of hemopoietic cells (<xref rid="bib17 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Jeffers et al., 2003; Villunger et al., 2003</xref>), are also involved in the killing of antigen-activated T cells during shutdown of an acute immune response. Indeed, Bim and Puma doubly deficient T cells survive better in culture in the absence of cytokines than those lacking only Bim or Puma (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Erlacher et al., 2006</xref>). Analysis of HSV-1-infected <italic>Bcl2l11</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Puma</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice could help determine whether these two BH3-only proteins have overlapping functions in the shutdown of acute T cell immune responses.</p>
      <p>The finding that Fas-mediated death receptor signaling and the Bim-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis both contribute to shutdown of chronic immune responses is consistent with the observations that loss of Bim (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Grayson et al., 2006</xref>), Bcl-2 overexpression (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Strasser et al., 1995</xref>), or loss of Fas (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kawabe and Ochi, 1991</xref>), each on their own, enhanced (to a relatively small extent) survival of T cells chronically stimulated by repeated SEB injection or LCMV infection. These results are consistent with the notion that the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are distinct and that they can cooperate in the removal of a cell population (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Strasser et al., 1995</xref>). Our results are reminiscent of the effects observed upon the overexpression of Bcl-2 in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice. It is highly probable that Bcl-2 might have countered Bim function in these mice. The importance of the genetic background on the severity of the <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> and <italic>Bcl2l11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> phenotypes is well established. Direct comparison of the <italic>Bcl2-tg Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice and our present study is limited by the fact that the mice used in the former study were on the C3H/HeJ background, whereas the <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice are on the C57BL/6 background. It is, however, possible that other BH3-only proteins may be involved in the killing of chronically activated T cells, and lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may therefore be even more severe in <italic>Bcl2-tg Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice.</p>
      <p>It appears likely that repeated TCR stimulation causes activation of the FasL-Fas signaling pathway in T cells during chronic infection (<xref rid="bib4 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 1995; Dhein et al., 1995</xref>), but how Bim is induced in this setting is less clear. This might be a consequence of a drop in the amounts of cytokines, similar to shutdown of acute immune responses. Alternatively, the calcium flux elicited by repeated TCR ligation might activate Bim (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 2002</xref>), and, pertinently, Bim is essential for deregulated calcium flux-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Combined loss of Fas and Bim also synergized in causing lymphadenopathy, demonstrating that these two pathways cooperate not only in the killing of T cells chronically activated by pathogen-borne antigens but also those stimulated by self-antigens. The unusual αβTCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> T lymphoid cells are seen only in <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> but not in <italic>Bcl2l11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, consistent with the view that they are descendants of chronically activated “conventional” T cells, which previously expressed CD4 or CD8 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Renno et al., 1996</xref>) and would normally be killed by FasL-Fas signaling (<xref rid="bib4 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 1995; Dhein et al., 1995</xref>). These unusual T cells are as sensitive as conventional T cells to cytokine deprivation but can be protected by loss of Bim, providing a likely explanation as to why their numbers are greatly increased in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> and even <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>+/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice compared to animals lacking only Fas. Although loss of either Fas or Bim causes fatal autoimmune disease on certain genetic backgrounds (e.g., MRL for <italic>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992</xref>] or mixed C57BL/6x129SV for <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>]), such pathology is not apparent for either mutation on an inbred C57BL/6 background. The immunopathology seen in <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>−/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> and <italic>Bcl2l11<sup>+/−</sup>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic> mice on this background therefore demonstrates that these two apoptotic pathways have overlapping functions in the prevention of autoimmune disease.</p>
      <p>These findings have implications for clinical medicine. For example, abnormally increased levels of Bim and enhanced sensitivity to FasL (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gougeon, 2003</xref>) have been detected in leukocytes from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other pathogens. Thus, Bim- and Fas-mediated apoptosis may cooperate to cause the excessive killing of antigen-specific T cells that is thought to impair clearance of the infectious microbes in these settings. Conversely, the inability to kill T cells that are chronically stimulated by self-antigens might underlie some autoimmune conditions. For example, because loss of one allele of Bim synergizes with Fas deficiency to cause immunopathology, it is possible that combinations of mutant alleles of Bim and Fas, which by themselves do not cause readily identifiable abnormalities, may underlie certain autoimmune diseases in humans.</p>
      <p>In summary, two major pathways regulate the life and death of lymphocytes. The death receptor pathway involves membrane receptors of the TNFR1 family, whereas the mitochondrial pathway is regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Here, we show that both pathways synergize to kill activated T cells in chronic immune responses, whereas death of activated T cells in acute immune responses relies only on the mitochondrial pathway.</p>

Cells were stained with FITC-coupled Thy-1 mAb (T24.31.2) and biotinylated mAbs specific for TCR Vβ3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10 (BD PharMingen), followed by R-phycoerythrin (PE)-streptavidin. PI was used to exclude dead cells and cells were analyzed in a FACScan.</p>
