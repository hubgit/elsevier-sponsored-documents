        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Latrophilin-1 (Lat-1), a target receptor for α-Latrotoxin, is a putative G protein-coupled receptor implicated in synaptic function. The extracellular portion of Lat-1 contains a rhamnose binding lectin (RBL)-like domain of unknown structure. RBL domains, first isolated from the eggs of marine species, are also found in the ectodomains of other metazoan transmembrane proteins, including a recently discovered coreceptor of the neuronal axon guidance molecule SLT-1/Slit. Here, we describe a structure of this domain from the mouse Lat-1. RBL adopts a unique α/β fold with long structured loops important for monosaccharide recognition, as shown in the structure of a complex with L-rhamnose. Sequence alignments and mutagenesis show that residues important for carbohydrate binding are often absent in other receptor-attached examples of RBL, including the SLT-1/Slit coreceptor. We postulate that this domain class facilitates direct protein-protein interactions in many transmembrane receptors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Latrophilins are putative adhesion-class G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bjarnadottir et al., 2007</xref>) widely expressed in the brain (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Matsushita et al., 1999</xref>). Their physiological ligand or functional roles are unknown, although they have been shown to interact with synaptic scaffolding proteins (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kreienkamp et al., 2002</xref>) and are implicated in synaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref rid="bib9 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Davletov et al., 1998; Willson et al., 2004</xref>). Latrophilins are targeted by α-Latrotoxin, the black widow spider venom toxin (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lelianova et al., 1997</xref>), and are required for venom toxicity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mee et al., 2004</xref>). The architecture of this receptor is characterized by the presence of a long, extracellular multidomain segment, which includes, in chordates, a rhamnose binding lectin (RBL)-like domain (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ozeki et al., 1991</xref>), a hormone binding domain (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Perrin et al., 1998</xref>), and an Olfactomedin-like domain (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>); some of these domains are lost in other phyla, although RBL is always present.</p>
      <p>RBL is a relatively rare domain first characterized from sea urchin eggs (SUEL) as a crosslinked homodimer of small, cysteine-rich subunits (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ozeki et al., 1991</xref>). RBL proteins show no amino acid sequence similarity to known lectin classes, and do not require the presence of cofactors, such as calcium, for carbohydrate recognition (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ozeki et al., 1991</xref>). In all cases characterized thus far (e.g., <xref rid="bib15 bib35 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999; Tateno et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2007</xref>), RBL domains cluster through tandem repeats, oligomerization, or both, possibly to increase carbohydrate avidity. The preferred binding monosaccharide of RBL, rhamnose, has no known biosynthetic pathway in animals; hence, it was proposed that egg RBL proteins serve an antimicrobial role, as rhamnose is found in bacterial cell walls (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to their presence in the Latrophilin clan, RBL domains exist in extracellular segments of two other metazoan transmembrane proteins, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) 1-like (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and a previously uncharacterized single transmembrane protein composed of two extracellular RBL domains, known as C21orf63 in human. A recent <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> study showed that the latter, termed EVA-1, acts as coreceptor for the SLT-1/Slit neuronal axon guidance cue and influences axon migration functions (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujisawa et al., 2007</xref>). The role of RBL in the ectodomains of these receptors and Latrophilin is not immediately clear, as endogenous rhamnose is rare in animals (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tymiak et al., 1993</xref>). One alternative hypothesis is that rhamnose mimics a different endogenous carbohydrate ligand (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999</xref>), but a noncarbohydrate ligand is another possibility.</p>
      <p>Here, we characterize the carbohydrate binding properties of the RBL domain from mouse Latrophilin-1 (Lat-1) GPCR (henceforth simply referred to as RBL), and determine its structure with and without rhamnose. The first structure of this domain class shows that the RBL domain adopts a unique α/β fold with two long structured loops that are important for carbohydrate recognition. Rhamnose is shown to have the highest affinity among various monosaccharides tested, and we were unable to find a higher affinity oligosaccharide ligand in an extensive carbohydrate binding assay. Sequence alignments of transmembrane receptor examples of the RBL domain show that residues important for carbohydrate binding are often substituted, and similar substitutions in mouse Lat-1 RBL abolish monosaccharide binding. We argue that the available evidence suggests that RBL domains recognize noncarbohydrate ligands when in a transmembrane receptor.</p>

        <title>RBL Characterization</title>
        <p>The Pfam HMM profile of RBL-type domains includes seven conserved cysteine residues. Genetic constructs of RBL encoding this minimal sequence (mouse Lat-1 residues 47–133) did not, however, produce folded protein, as judged by NMR. An N-terminal extension of approximately 15 amino acids (residues 30–134), including an eighth cysteine, was necessary for folding; additional N-terminal or C-terminal extensions did not appear to contribute to the folded protein core (data not shown). This eight cysteine construct agrees well with previous alignments from tandem repeats of these domains (<xref rid="bib15 bib35 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999; Tateno et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), and with exon boundaries in the gene locus. All cysteine residues were judged to be oxidized based on mass spectrometry. Later structural studies (see below) showed a disulphide formation pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) identical to that previously reported for an RBL-type protein from Spanish mackerel eggs (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al., 2007</xref>). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments on RBL (residues 30–134) and larger constructs indicated a monomer in solution (see <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> in the <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> available with this article online). Inclusion of a ninth cysteine residue through a C-terminal extension did not result in crosslinked homodimers as observed in SUEL (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ozeki et al., 1991</xref>), and studies of protein dynamics by NMR showed that RBL remains monomeric, even at high protein concentrations (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous studies reported carbohydrate affinity of RBL-type proteins from oligomeric and/or concatemeric variants of this domain (<xref rid="bib15 bib28 bib35 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999; Ozeki et al., 1991; Tateno et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2007</xref>) with an assay involving carbohydrate inhibition of hemagglutination, which requires multimeric protein forms (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ozeki et al., 1991</xref>). Such experiments do not distinguish between direct or apparent affinity effects. We studied the direct interaction of RBL with carbohydrates by monitoring NMR spectral perturbations induced by binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B–1D). In general, RBL binding preferences are similar to those reported for other members of this class (<xref rid="bib15 bib28 bib35 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999; Ozeki et al., 1991; Tateno et al., 1998; Terada et al., 2007</xref>), with tightest binding for L-rhamnose (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.8 mM) and significantly less binding affinity for D-galactose, D-fucose, and L-arabinose (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Other monosaccharide titrations yielded no apparent binding, while titrations with galactose-derived disaccharides showed binding affinities similar to (for melibiose) or less than (lactose) galactose. Physiological saline or 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in a tricine buffer did not influence the observed affinities (data not shown). An extended screen performed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics with 320 mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides immobilized on a printed chip array, and fluorescently labeled RBL, did not result in appreciable binding (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). We were unable to detect the monosaccharide interactions observed in the NMR with the immobilized glycan assay because interactions weaker than 0.1–0.5 mM K<sub>d</sub> are below the detection limit for this method (David F. Smith, personal communication).</p>

        <title>Description of the RBL Structure</title>
        <p>The RBL solution structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) was determined from 3476 distance, geometry, and orientation restraints, corresponding to over 35 restraints per ordered residue. A complete analysis of the model characteristics is provided in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. RBL is composed of five β strands (residues 36–41, 45–49, 54–65, 101–105, and 121–130), a single, long α helix (residues 86–96), and two small helical elements (single-turn α-helix residues 75–78 and single-turn 3<sub>10</sub>-helix residues 108–110). The overall fold is that of a β sandwich with two antiparallel sheets (composed of β1, β5, and β3, and β2 and β4, respectively) enclosing the hydrophobic core (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). The two sheets diverge between β4 and β3, and α2 caps the exposed side of the sandwich. Two disulphide bridges stabilize elements of this structural core, connecting the ends of β2 and β5 strands (Cys50–Cys128), and the end of α2 with β4 (Cys96–Cys102).</p>
        <p>Unusually for a small protein, RBL includes two long loops (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B) connecting β3 and α2 (residues 66–85, loop<sub>1</sub>) and β4 with β5 (residues 106–120, loop<sub>2</sub>). Although these loops do not adopt regular secondary structure, apart from the two single-turn helical elements mentioned, they are well defined in the calculated ensemble of structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C); this agrees with fast-timescale dynamics experiments (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) that show no significant mobility for these segments. The shorter loop<sub>2</sub> features a generally conserved proline-rich sequence, PDPCPG, and is in contact with the larger loop<sub>1</sub>. The conformation of these loops is consolidated by two further disulphide bridges connecting the two loops together (Cys83–Cys115) and the end of β1 with loop<sub>1</sub> (Cys41–Cys71). Importantly, two fully buried charged residues, Arg65 and Lys120, stabilize loop<sub>1</sub> and loop<sub>2</sub>, respectively, through multiple hydrogen bonds inferred from the structure. Both of these charged residues are highly conserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A and alignment in <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al., 2007</xref>). Residue-specific substitutions performed at these sites, such as K120A or K120R, yielded proteins exhibiting substantial line broadening and multiple missing resonances in the NMR spectra (data not shown), supporting the idea that these residues have a key structural role.</p>
        <p>Structural alignments of known protein models against RBL by Dali (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holm and Sander, 1998</xref>) yielded few positive results, none of which included alignments to the two loops. Alignments with other structural tools, such as SSM (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>), did not yield any nonzero probability matches. Removal of the RBL loops from the query model increased the number of aligned proteins in Dali, although the alignment scores remained poor. The five best alignments are summarized in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>, and the aligned segments of RBL and the Nucleoplasmin core fragment, the highest scoring protein, are colored in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D. As indicated, the structure alignment extends only over the β-stranded portion of RBL; none of the aligned proteins features a helix equivalent to α2. Thus, although strictly not a novel fold, the structure of RBL is unique, as evidenced by low structural similarity scores (Z ≤ 3.2). For comparison, structurally well-represented folds of similar size, such as immunoglobulin-type domains, yield similarity scores in excess of 10, and Z scores lower than 2 are not considered statistically significant. Nucleoplasmin core features short conserved loops that assist in the formation of a decameric particle (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dutta et al., 2001</xref>). Although these loops are not similar in sequence or structure to the equivalent long RBL loops, it is intriguing to speculate that the RBL loops may assist in protein interactions in the physiological function of this domain.</p>
        <p>Marine egg lectins featuring RBL-type domains are primarily found in multimeric forms of tandem repeats, with the exception of SUEL. Based on our RBL structure, there are few linker residues connecting these repeats in known examples—at most, five in CSL3, STL3, and WCL3 lectins (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al., 2007</xref>). This would suggest that tandem RBL domains follow closely a beads-on-string model, with limited interactions between domains on the same molecule. Intermolecular interactions are likely present, forming the multimeric species observed; however, our data do not reveal the nature of these interactions, as mouse Latrophilin RBL is monomeric in solution, even under high protein concentrations.</p>

        <title>Carbohydrate Binding to RBL</title>
        <p>Structure determination of RBL in complex with L-rhamnose was based on the average minimized structure of the apoprotein together with intermolecular restraints, as described in the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. A total of 28 unambiguous and ambiguous distance restraints were used to position the rhamnose residue on RBL. The final 25 model ensemble of structures shows essentially no changes to the RBL domain in the complex (root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] from the apostructure of ∼0.23 Å for the backbone). All intermolecular restraints applied were satisfied within a 0.3 Å limit, yielding a 0.33 Å rmsd for all rhamnose heavy atoms in the ensemble when the RBL backbone was superimposed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). The carbohydrate binding site is located on an exposed pocket primarily formed by loop<sub>2</sub>. In the structure, atoms from two residues of that loop, N and N<sup>ζ</sup> of Lys120 and N of Gly117, are directly involved in hydrogen bonding interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D) with the rhamnose O4, O3, and O2, respectively. The O<sup>ɛ</sup> of Glu42, from the β1-β2 turn, contribute two hydrogen bonds to rhamnose O3 and O4, and the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr63 a further bond to rhamnose O3. No hydrogen bonds involving the rhamnose O5 or O1 (in either α- or β-anomeric form) could be inferred from the structure; thus, RBL is not expected to be selective for a particular rhamnose anomer. In this configuration, the rhamnose methyl group, H6, occupies a gap between the Gln77 and Tyr119 RBL side chains and the Thr118 backbone atoms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). The side chain orientations of Glu42, Tyr63, and Lys120 do not change substantially in the complex compared to the apostructure. Indeed, in the apostructure, these residues take part in the hydrogen bond network stabilizing loop<sub>2</sub>; rhamnose appears to join this network seamlessly, and complements it by linking the three aforementioned residues to Gly117.</p>
        <p>Past studies of RBL domains binding properties suggested that carbohydrate binding depends on the orientation of the O2 and O4 hydroxyls, as these are similar between rhamnose and galactose, while the O3 orientation differs (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Tateno et al., 2002</xref>). However, our structure of the rhamnose complex indicates that all hydroxyl groups apart from O1 form important hydrogen bonds—no fewer than three in the case of O3. In addition, three-dimensional galactose and rhamnose structures show that the O2 and O4 hydroxyl groups do not occupy the same axial or equatorial positions in both monosaccharides (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). Close inspection of the chemical shift perturbations induced by rhamnose and galactose shows that a number of differences exist. In particular, Gly64 and Asp74 are significantly perturbed in rhamnose, but not in galactose, while the relative perturbations of Cys115, Gly117, and Lys120 are also different (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). Even residues perturbed to a similar extent, such as Thr118, show differences in the manner of perturbation, as seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D.</p>
        <p>We suggest that RBL binds galactose in an inverted configuration around the O5-C3 axis when compared with rhamnose; RBL residues that hydrogen bond to O2 of rhamnose would thus interact with galactose O4, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). In this configuration, the inversion-equivalent hydroxyl groups of both monosaccharides occupy the same axial or equatorial positions, rendering rhamnose and galactose identical with respect to the putative hydrogen bonding interactions presented here. Judging from chemical shift perturbation patterns (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>), this type of inverted binding will also be the case for D-fucose and L-arabinose.</p>
        <p>This arrangement likely explains the apparent selectivity of RBL domains for rhamnose, as the C6 rhamnose methyl group affords better complementarity with the binding pocket than galactose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F and 4G); it also indicates a mechanism for selection of α-linked galactosides. Moieties β linked to galactose would adopt the same equatorial position as rhamnose C6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F); however, due to their large size, this would result in a steric clash with residues on RBL loop<sub>1</sub>. This is consistent with the observed reduction in binding affinity (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and enhanced chemical shift perturbations in loop<sub>1</sub> observed in the lactose titration (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, α-linked moieties occupy an axial position and would not interact further with the protein, consistent with the observed identical binding and induced perturbations of melibiose and galactose. Moieties α linked to rhamnose will also occupy an axial position and will not affect rhamnose binding, as seen in ouabain (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tymiak et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effects of Residue Substitutions on Carbohydrate Binding</title>
        <p>A number of RBL domains, from both transmembrane receptors and free proteins in eggs, feature substitutions of residues involved in carbohydrate binding, especially of residues equivalent to Glu42 and Lys120 in RBL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Examples of these include the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lat-1 RBL, the N- and C-terminal RBL domains of EVA-1 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujisawa et al., 2007</xref>), the RBL of PKD1-like 2 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>), and individual domains of the SML and STL tandem repeat lectins (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al., 2007</xref>). Glu42 in mouse Lat-1 RBL interacts with the carbohydrates by providing two important hydrogen bonds; Lys120 contributes a further hydrogen bond and stabilizes loop<sub>2</sub>. We created substitutions in these two residues of RBL and determined carbohydrate affinity by NMR titrations (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All substitutions attempted dramatically reduced or completely abolished rhamnose and galactose binding, including conservative mutations, such as E42D, E42Q, and K120R (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, we expect that the presence of a glutamate residue at the +1 position from the first cysteine residue is necessary for carbohydrate binding. In the absence of binding, the glutamate-to-aspartate substitution is probably favored over other residues in order to neutralize the buried loop<sub>2</sub> lysine charge. Similarly, Lys120 cannot be functionally substituted by another positive charge, and is likely optimal for the observed binding.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Carbohydrate recognition domains, or lectins, form a ubiquitous protein class with over 20 lectin families annotated based on amino acid sequence patterns and functional similarities. Lectins have a wide variety of possible roles, including cell adhesion, cell signaling, immune response, host-pathogen interactions, and control of cellular growth (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sharon, 2007</xref>). It is generally accepted that many of these roles involve recognition of specific carbohydrate patterns by these domains, typically in the form of oligosaccharides. We have described here what is, to our knowledge, the first structure and monosaccharide recognition mode of RBL, a relatively rare lectin-like domain class. The fold adopted is unique, and carbohydrate recognition involves contacts with the long loop<sub>2</sub>. This is similar to carbohydrate binding by other proteins, such as C-type lectins, that also feature long loops responsible for binding (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zelensky and Gready, 2005</xref>). However, in contrast to C-type lectins, the carbohydrate binding loop of RBL is not flexible, and we were unable to find a high-affinity glycan ligand in a solid-state screen, although rhamnose was represented only as a monosaccharide in that assay.</p>
      <p>However, rhamnose is a questionable endogenous ligand for RBL domains in extracellular regions of transmembrane proteins. Indeed, there is no evidence that rhamnose binding is the biological function of Latrophilins, rhamnose is found in animals only rarely (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tymiak et al., 1993</xref>), and there is no known biosynthetic pathway for it. The direct RBL affinity for rhamnose measured here (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.8 mM) is weak compared with monosaccharide affinities in other lectin systems (<xref rid="bib1 bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Acharya et al., 1990; Schwarz et al., 1993; Surolia et al., 1996</xref>). Simple calculations based on published hemagglutination inhibition data (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hosono et al., 1999</xref>) suggest that the K<sub>d</sub> of rhamnose binding by SUEL is approximately 100–200 μM, 10 times tighter than the affinity displayed by Lat-1 RBL. Therefore, we believe that the single Lat-1 RBL domain would not be sufficient for carbohydrate discrimination, recognition, and attachment. Furthermore, substitutions of residues important for carbohydrate binding, especially Glu42 to aspartate, are common in receptor RBL molecules. This substitution is found in the N-terminal RBL domain of EVA-1, an SLT-1/Slit axon guidance coreceptor (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujisawa et al., 2007</xref>), while the C-terminal EVA-1 RBL domain lacks both the necessary glutamate residue and the conserved loop<sub>2</sub> lysine residue (Lys120 in RBL) that is involved in carbohydrate binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The mouse PKD1-like 2 protein RBL domain also lacks the aforementioned lysine residue; thus, we would not expect it to bind carbohydrates. Sequence alignments of RBL domains from these three transmembrane protein clans in diverse species show that residues important for carbohydrate binding are often absent in one species, but present in closely related organisms. For example, the important glutamate residue is absent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lat-1 RBL, but present in <italic>Ostertagia</italic> sp. and <italic>Cooperia</italic> sp. Lat-1. In our opinion, this lack of strict conservation for binding residues in closely related species indicates that carbohydrate binding is not critical for function.</p>
      <p>Although the possibility of a yet-unknown binding glycan cannot be discounted, we favor a situation whereby RBL domains in transmembrane proteins, including Latrophilins, recognize noncarbohydrate ligands exclusively or in addition to carbohydrate moieties. These noncarbohydrate ligands could include lipids or, possibly, other proteins through direct interactions. Similar protein-protein interaction functions have previously been demonstrated for C-type lectin domains; for example, in recognition of IgE by the Fc<sub>ɛ</sub>RII receptor (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bettler et al., 1989</xref>), Tenascin-R and Fibulin-2 by Lecticans (<xref rid="bib2 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Aspberg et al., 1997; Olin et al., 2001</xref>), and major histocompatibility complex ligands by natural killer cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>). RBL domains may have evolved to accommodate similar interactions with yet-unknown upstream proteins as part of their receptor functions. If correct, our suggestion has implications for possible Latrophilin ligands and the mode of SLT-1/Slit binding by EVA-1.</p>

        <title>Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification</title>
        <p>The RBL domain of mouse Lat-1 (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> Lphn-1) was cloned in a modified pPICZα vector (Invitrogen) for expression in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. Mutant forms of RBL coding for residue substitutions were constructed by a PCR-based method. Approximately 10 μg quantities of these constructs were digested by <italic>SacI</italic> or <italic>PmeI</italic> endonucleases and transformed to <italic>P. pastoris</italic> strain X-33 by electroporation. Successful transformants through genomic integration in the <italic>aox1</italic> locus were selected for initial resistance to Zeocin (Invitrogen), and could be stably propagated in the absence of antibiotic. The proteins of interest were tagged for secretion with the α-factor signal propeptide sequence, and contained a single glycine residue as cloning artifact after posttranslational processing.</p>
        <p>Protein expression was performed in minimal media at pH 6.0 with ammonium sulfate and glucose (during biomass growth), or methanol (during induction of protein expression), as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Uniform isotopic enrichment was achieved by using <sup>15</sup>N-enriched ammonium sulfate (Spectra Stable Isotopes), and unenriched or <sup>13</sup>C-enriched glucose and methanol (Spectra Stable Isotopes) under high-density fermentation conditions. After 5 days of protein expression, cells were discarded and the medium was filtered, followed by 5-fold dilution with H<sub>2</sub>O and adjustment to pH 3.0. The secreted protein was concentrated by retention in a cation exchange column (GE Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.0), and eluted with a steep gradient to 2 M NaCl in the same buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to pH 6.0, and incubated for 4 hr at room temperature with approximately 1000 U of EndoH endoglycosidase (New England Biolabs). The protein was subsequently dialyzed against a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and further purified by anion exchange chromatography (GE Biosciences), dialysis against the final NMR buffer, and concentration with Amicon spin columns (Millipore). The final protein concentration was estimated by UV absorbance at 280 nm.</p>

        <p>RBL extensively dialyzed against PBS was fluorescently labeled with the AlexaFluor 488 protein labeling kit (Invitrogen).

Approximately 0.1 mg of labeled protein was provided to the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (National Institute of General Medical Sciences/National Institutes of Health) for screening in a printed glycan array chip (version 3.0, 320 glycan targets).</p>

        <title>Structure Calculations</title>
        <p>The RBL structure was derived by simulated annealing in torsion angle space starting from an extended conformation, and further refined by a simulated slow-cooling process in Cartesian space with the XPLOR-NIH software package (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schwieters et al., 2003</xref>). The rhombicity and anisotropy components necessary for the RDC restraints were determined by grid search with an initial protein structure, and further refined in subsequent calculation iterations. ϕ and ψ dihedral angle values were predicted with TALOS (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cornilescu et al., 1999</xref>) and supplemented, where possible, with values by PREDITOR (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berjanskii et al., 2006</xref>). Explicit hydrogen bond restraints were not applied; instead, we used a potential of mean force that conducts a free search for putative hydrogen bonds during the simulation, and optimizes the spatial arrangement of peptidyl backbone units accordingly (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Grishaev and Bax, 2004</xref>). Only nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE), hydrogen bond, dihedral angle, RDC, and <sup>3</sup><italic>J</italic><sub>HNHα</sub>-coupling potential energy terms were used as restraints during simulated annealing. Additional potential energy terms were used during refinement, including a radius of gyration restraint, with a calculated value of 13 Å applied to residues 36–131 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kuszewski et al., 1999</xref>), a conformational database potential term (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kuszewski et al., 1996</xref>), and direct refinement against <sup>13</sup>C<sup>α</sup> and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>β</sup> chemical shifts (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kuszewski et al., 1995</xref>). The 25 lowest energy structures (out of 50 calculated) were retained and comprise the final structure ensemble.</p>
        <p>Calculation of the rhamnose complex structure was based on the average minimized apo-RBL structure. This was rerefined in the presence of a single sugar residue with the intermolecular NOE distance restraints obtained. Generally, intra-RBL restraints were held invariable, although a small number of RDC and <sup>3</sup><italic>J</italic>-derived restraints from RBL residues with substantial chemical shift perturbations were removed. TALOS- (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cornilescu et al., 1999</xref>) and PREDITOR (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berjanskii et al., 2006</xref>) -derived dihedral angle restraints were recalculated based on <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts upon rhamnose saturation. <sup>13</sup>C<sup>α/β</sup> chemical shift-based restraints were also similarly updated. The radius of gyration potential term used during refinement was extended to include the rhamnose residue. Examination of 3D <sup>15</sup>N-edited NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra acquired in the absence or presence of saturating rhamnose showed a small number of differences in intramolecular RBL crosspeaks. Where applicable, these crosspeaks were reassigned, while repulsive distance restraints were implemented for resonances that disappeared in the complex. Intermolecular distance restraints between rhamnose and RBL were derived from a <sup>13</sup>C-purged/<sup>13</sup>C-filtered NOESY spectrum (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1994</xref>), which selects for NOE crosspeaks between <sup>12</sup>C-attached and <sup>13</sup>C-attached protons, acquired in a D<sub>2</sub>O sample of <sup>13</sup>C-enriched RBL saturated with rhamnose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Additional intermolecular restraints were obtained by examining the aforementioned 3D <sup>15</sup>N-edited NOESY spectra of RBL for novel crosspeaks corresponding to rhamnose resonances. Thus, we were able to derive a total of 16 specific intermolecular distance restraints connecting RBL and the H1, H4, H5, and H6 atoms of rhamnose. The RBL <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift perturbation data were also used in a manner similar to that utilized in intermolecular docking (<xref rid="bib7 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clore and Schwieters, 2003; Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>) to give a further 12 ambiguous distance restraints. No explicit intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonding restraints were used for this calculation, and rhamnose was held at its conformation observed in high-resolution diffraction studies (RCSB codes: <ext-link xlink:href="1M7D" ext-link-type="gen">1M7D</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="1M7I" ext-link-type="gen">1M7I</ext-link>), which is virtually identical to the idealized models provided by the Hetero-Compound Information Centre. The α-anomeric form of rhamnose was chosen for this calculation because it is three times more populated in solution, although the β form was also considered. A total of 50 structures was generated, and the final ensemble consists of the 25 lowest-energy structures. Galactose modeling to the binding site was based on the conformation found in diffraction studies (RCSB codes: <ext-link xlink:href="2NMO" ext-link-type="gen">2NMO</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="1OH4" ext-link-type="gen">1OH4</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>RBL Sequence Alignment and Residue Conservation</p>
        <p>(A) Amino acid sequences of RBL domains from egg lectins, Latrophilin receptors, and the mouse PKD-1 like 2 and nematode EVA-1 proteins. -N, -M, or -C symbolize N-terminal, middle, or C-terminal RBL domains in tandem repeats. Two nonhomologous sequence insertions in the EVA-1 N-terminal RBL domain (11 residues) and C-terminal domain (seven residues) are omitted and replaced by double slash symbols. Yellow highlight: cysteine residues; cyan: residues involved in carbohydrate binding in mouse RBL; hash symbols: buried charged residues that stabilize the protein loops. Secondary structure elements and the pattern of disulphide formation are shown.</p>
        <p>(B) Ligand titrations induced chemical shift perturbations in the NMR spectra as indicated by arrows.</p>
