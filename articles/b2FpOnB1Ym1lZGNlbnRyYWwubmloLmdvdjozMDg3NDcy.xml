      <abstract>
        <p>We have studied the morphology and the spatially resolved photoluminescence of rubrene thin films at the early stage of crystallization. The initial growth proceeds via the formation of a wetting layer and the nucleation of islands with an amorphous structure. Crystallization starts when the amorphous islands coalesce and needle like crystalline fibers are formed in the gap between islands. The crystalline fibers then grow on top and in between the original amorphous islands leading to an “open network” of islands. The latter acts as the basis for the growth of semi-crystalline spherulites.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Increasing scientific and technological interest is devoted to organic materials for their promising applications in optoelectronic devices such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs) <xref rid="bib0005 bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>, light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) <xref rid="bib0015 bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>, and photovoltaic cells <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Because of the favorable overlapping of the π-orbitals of the adjacent molecules, rubrene (C<sub>42</sub>H<sub>28</sub>, 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene) constitutes one of the most promising candidates for the realization of high performance OFETs. Indeed, OFETs based on rubrene single crystals exhibit a very high carrier mobility <xref rid="bib0030 bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. On the other hand, it is still a great challenge to fabricate OFETs based on rubrene thin films with satisfying electronic properties by organic molecular beam deposition (OMBD) <xref rid="bib0040 bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. Käfer et al. have shown that the different molecular conformation in gas (nonplanar) and bulk phase (planar) results in a disordered seed layer on the substrate which impedes the growth of ordered thin films <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Accordingly, the growth of crystallites with a bulk structure can occur only at particular nucleation sites <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Progress has been achieved in improving the crystallinity of rubrene thin films by deposition on organic single crystal substrates <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or inorganic substrates precovered by organic layers <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, deposition on passivation layer of self-assembled octadecyltrimethylsilane on silica <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, prolonged annealing of amorphous thin films in vacuum <xref rid="bib0070 bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref> and by using hot-wall epitaxy (HWE) <xref rid="bib0080 bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. However, a detailed understanding of the growth mechanism is still missing. It is thus very important to study the growth, especially at its initial stage. It is well known that the crystallinity of rubrene not only influences its electronic performance but also its optical properties <xref rid="bib0070 bib0075 bib0090 bib0095 bib0100 bib0105 bib0110 bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[14,15,18–23]</xref>. Characteristic photoluminescence (PL) spectra have been reported for amorphous <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and crystalline phases of rubrene <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>, respectively. Particularly, it has been demonstrated that the PL spectrum can be used as a sensitive probe for the transformation of thin rubrene films from the amorphous to the polycrystalline phase <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we have investigated the morphology and PL emission of rubrene thin films deposited on muscovite mica (0 0 1) substrates by HWE using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy (FM) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Special attention was devoted to the initial stage of crystallization in rubrene thin films. The spatially resolved PL emission measured by LSCM allows us to determine the location and the onset of crystallization.</p>

      <title>Experimental</title>
      <p>Rubrene thin films were deposited on the (0 0 1) surface of muscovite mica using hot-wall epitaxy (HWE) <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The mica substrates were cleaved in air and then transferred into a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10<sup>−6</sup> mbar. Before rubrene deposition, the substrate was thoroughly degassed by heating for 30 min at 150 °C in vacuum. During deposition, the substrate was kept at 150 °C, while the source and wall temperature was 160 °C. AFM measurements were performed with a Veeco Dimensions S3100 microscope with super sharp silicon tips (Nanosensors SSS-NCHR-50) operated in tapping mode. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti) using a Hg lamp for illumination. The excitation wavelength can be selected within a wide range from UV to red by using different filter cubes. Fluorescence images were acquired with an electron multiplying CCD camera (Luca EMCCD from Andor Technology). In order to investigate the polarization state of the fluorescence signal, a beam splitter (Cairn Research Optosplit II), which allows dual polarisation imaging, was attached in front of the camera. For acquiring the PL spectrum from the field of view of the microscope, a high-resolution spectrometer (HR4000 from Ocean Optics) can be attached to the eyepiece of the microscope. Furthermore, a Nikon Eclipse C1si confocal microscope system equipped with a spectrometer using 32 channel photo-multiplier tube detectors was used to record spatially resolved PL spectra.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p><xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the fluorescence image of rubrene grown on the (0 0 1) surface of muscovite mica. A medium band blue excitation filter (Nikon B-2A, excitation wavelength 390–450 nm) was used for the experiment. The image shows that the surface is covered by islands with an average size of about 3 μm and an average height of about 300 nm. The islands are distributed homogeneously on large terraces over most of the substrate area. From the eyepiece, one can see clearly that the emission of these islands is green under irradiation with blue light. Although the shape of the islands is not really uniform, no preferential orientation of the island is observed. Besides, the top and bottom panels in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, which are taken from the same area but with polarization along two orthogonal directions as marked by the arrows, show equal intensities. This observation demonstrates that the rubrene molecules in the islands are randomly oriented, suggesting an amorphous structure of the islands. Indeed, the corresponding PL spectrum plotted in <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> is very close to that of amorphous rubrene thin films reported by Park et al. <xref rid="bib0070 bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>, characterized by a broad peak around 560 nm. Based on the unpolarized nature of the emission and its spectral line shape, we can conclude that the structure of the islands shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> is amorphous. This conclusion fully agrees with the results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transmission electron diffraction (TED) measurements obtained from samples prepared under similar conditions <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thin films with similar morphology and structure have also been observed before the onset of crystallization <xref rid="bib0060 bib0065 bib0130 bib0135 bib0140 bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[12,13,26–29]</xref>. The not completely round appearance of the islands is characteristic of the very late stage of amorphous growth <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the typical image presented in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, occasionally, areas with different morphology and emission properties can be found on the same sample. <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a shows such an area containing an open network of islands which emits yellow light. Indeed, the corresponding PL spectrum measured from the same area reveals additional emission features peaked at 570 nm and 645 nm (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In fact, on single crystal rubrene samples, PL emission at the same wavelengths has been reported. According to Mitrofanov et al., the 570 nm and 645 nm features are contributed by the emission from crystalline rubrene and its oxidation state, respectively <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. The central area of the network structure shows a particularly strong emission at these wavelengths with some degree of polarization. To have a closer look at the network structure, the area surrounded by white frame in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a was imaged using an objective with larger magnification (60×) and the result is presented in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b. In this figure one can clearly see that the yellow islands are those covered and connected by strongly emitting fibers. Besides, it is the emission from these fibers which shows a dependence on the polarization. The morphology of the islands and the fibers on top of them can be seen more clearly in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c, which displays an AFM image recorded from the area marked by the white frame in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b. Comparing <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b with <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c, it is evident that the islands which emit yellow light are those covered by fibers. The thick fibers located in the central area of the network exhibit sharp and straight edges indicating a crystalline structure. The line profile taken from the AFM image in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c along the line AB is plotted in the same figure. From this, the cross-sectional profile of the fibers can be resolved, yielding a height of about 50 nm and a width of around 250 nm. Most importantly, from the morphology revealed by AFM and the spectral emission detected by fluorescence microscopy, we conclude that the fibers are crystalline rather than amorphous. Consequently, the open network of yellow islands observed here can be assigned to the initial stage of growth of microcrystalline rubrene films. Similar structures have been reported recently by different authors <xref rid="bib0065 bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[13,25]</xref>. Particularly, Djuric et al. have investigated samples prepared under similar conditions using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transmission electron diffraction (TED). Their TEM images show a similar morphology as <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c. Furthermore, the corresponding TED pattern reveals that these fibers crystallize in an orthorhombic structure <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Due to the vrey similar appearance revealed by AFM in this study and TEM by Djuric et al. <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we believe that the rubrene fibers observed in the current study have the same well orientated crystalline structure.</p>
      <p>To study the evolution of the morphology and its influence on the PL emission, LSCM was used to image selected areas from the same sample. <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a and b shows LSCM images recorded from different areas of the same sample. A 473 nm laser was used as excitation source and the PL signal was detected with the 32 channel spectrometer. The color of the images thus reflects the true emission spectrum. As discussed before, the surface is predominantly covered by small rubrene islands emitting green light (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a), which is characteristic of the amorphous nature of these islands. Thanks to the enhanced resolution of LSCM, one can discern in <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a some examples where yellow needles appear in the gap between two coalescing islands. Taking yellow emission as a signature of crystallinity, the yellow needles can be identified as the nucleation centers of crystalline rubrene. Käfer et al. have argued that the nuclei of rubrene crystalline phase only forms after the growth of an amorphous layer with large nominal thickness <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, our results show that the nucleation of crystalline structures only sets in when the amorphous rubrene islands start to coalesce. In addition, our microscopic study reveals that the nuclei are needle-like crystalline fibers, which initially appear in the gaps between the coalescing islands.</p>
      <p>Indeed, in <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b, one can see the network of islands covered and linked by these crystalline fibers. Local PL spectra measured from the areas between the islands (area 1), on top of a bare island (area 2), on top of an island covered by fibers (area 3) and a thick fiber (area 4) are plotted in <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a. In areas 1, 2 and 3, the spectra are dominated by the emission at 540 nm. In contrast, the thick fiber in area 4 shows two well developed emission peaks at 570 nm and 640 nm characteristic of crystalline rubrene. Therefore, in full agreement with what we have concluded before, the islands and the areas in between them are in an amorphous state, whereas the fibers are crystalline. The fact that the areas between the islands present the same PL spectrum as the islands themselves, indicates the presence of an amorphous wetting layer. A closer look at the emission spectrum of area 3, corresponding to an island covered by fibers, reveals that the intensity at wavelengths above 550 nm is comparatively higher than that emitted from area 1 or 2. This effect can be seen more clearly in <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b, where the normalized difference 2 × ((<italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> − <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub>)/(<italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> + <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub>)) of the PL intensity of area 3 and area 2 is plotted. The line shape of the normalized difference is similar to that of the PL spectrum of area 4 (also shown in <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b for comparison). Consequently, the enhanced emission above 550 nm from area 3 can be attributed to the emission from the crystalline fibers on top of the islands which, themselves, remain amorphous.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We have studied the morphology and the spatially resolved PL spectrum of rubrene films grown by hot wall epitaxy on the mica (0 0 1) surface. At first, amorphous islands on top of an amorphous wetting layer are formed upon deposition. The nucleation of crystalline structures sets in when the amorphous rubrene islands start to coalesce and needle-like crystalline fibers appear in the gaps between the coalescing islands. Later, the crystalline fibers spread out and connect the amorphous islands, leading to the formation of a crystalline open network which could be the early stage of the semi-crystalline spherulite growth <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The latter develops by consumption of the surrounding amorphous rubrene at the growth front <xref rid="bib0065 bib0145 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[13,29,30]</xref>.</p>
