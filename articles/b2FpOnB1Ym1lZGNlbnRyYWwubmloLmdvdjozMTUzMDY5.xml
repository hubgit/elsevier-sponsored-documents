      <abstract>
        <p>This paper presents a novel, publicly available repository of anatomically segmented brain images of healthy subjects as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The underlying magnetic resonance images have been obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. T1-weighted screening and baseline images (1.5 T and 3 T) have been processed with the multi-atlas based MAPER procedure, resulting in labels for 83 regions covering the whole brain in 816 subjects. Selected segmentations were subjected to visual assessment. The segmentations are self-consistent, as evidenced by strong agreement between segmentations of paired images acquired at different field strengths (Jaccard coefficient: 0.802 ± 0.0146). Morphometric comparisons between diagnostic groups (normal; stable mild cognitive impairment; mild cognitive impairment with progression to Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer's disease) showed highly significant group differences for individual regions, the majority of which were located in the temporal lobe. Additionally, significant effects were seen in the parietal lobe. Increased left/right asymmetry was found in posterior cortical regions. An automatically derived white-matter hypointensities index was found to be a suitable means of quantifying white-matter disease. This repository of segmentations is a potentially valuable resource to researchers working with ADNI data.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>This paper presents results of a project that aims to provide anatomical labels based on automatic segmentation for magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging data supplied by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The result of this work is made available to the general scientific community via the same channels as the source ADNI data.</p>
      <p>Anatomical segmentations of structural images of the human brain can be used for a plethora of purposes. A principal motivation is to understand the impact of neurodegeneration, trauma, epilepsy and other conditions on the brain's macroscopic structure. Such understanding leads to morphometric descriptors with the potential to serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of brain disease (<xref rid="bb0085 bb0110 bb0155 bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Colliot et al., 2008; Duchesne et al., 2008; Heckemann et al., 2008; Klöppel et al., 2008</xref>). Beyond the realm of morphometric analysis, individual anatomical segmentation is frequently used in the analysis of functional imaging data, e.g. to precisely locate areas of hypo- or hypermetabolism within the subject's own anatomical reference frame. Anatomical segmentation also enables studies of regional connectivity based on diffusion tensor imaging [e.g. <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Traynor et al. (2010)</xref>].</p>
      <p>ADNI MR imaging data have hitherto been provided with only minimal amounts of segmentation information. For a subset of ADNI images, labels of the left and right hippocampi are available. These labels have been generated using a semiautomatic tool (SNT, Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies, Louisville, CO) that relies on manual seed point placement. In work by <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al. (2002)</xref>, the SNT tool was claimed to yield hippocampal volume measurements equivalent to a manual delineation protocol, but the validation was not entirely convincing: Hsu et al. make reference to previous work by <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al. (1992)</xref>, but the protocol described there finds distinctly larger volumes in normal adult hippocampi (Watson — right: 5264 ± 652 mm<sup>3</sup>, left: 4903 ± 684 mm<sup>3</sup>; Hsu — right: 3103 ± 505 mm<sup>3</sup>, left: 2945 ± 503 mm<sup>3</sup>). Furthermore, the SNT method yields volume measurements that are yet smaller than those of the manual reference (right: 2323 ± 326 mm<sup>3</sup>, left: 2275 ± 253 mm<sup>3</sup>). Both the validation and anatomical coverage of available ADNI segmentation data are thus limited.</p>
      <p>Beyond the hippocampus, researchers requiring anatomical labels of ADNI data have three choices:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Normalize subject images to a reference space and apply one of a choice of anatomical volume or surface atlases available for this space [e.g. Talairach (<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Talairach and Tournoux, 1988</xref>), AAL (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2002</xref>), Maximum Probability Brain Atlas (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al., 2003</xref>), The Whole Brain Atlas,<xref rid="fn0015" ref-type="fn">3</xref> LPBA40 (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Shattuck et al., 2008</xref>), PALS-B12 (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen, 2005</xref>), the Freesurfer atlas <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fischl et al. (2004)</xref>, or a purpose-made atlas]. This can be a simple solution, in particular if other parts of the analysis already require spatial normalization. Since the segmentation process takes place in the common space, an inverse normalization has to be carried out in order to recover the volume and shape of segmented regions in native space. This approach is typically based on a single-subject atlas or maximum-probability atlas. The latter are generally preferable because they tend to eliminate idiosyncrasies due to anatomical variants in individual subjects. Success depends on the suitability of the chosen atlas, as well as the suitability and robustness of the chosen spatial normalization algorithm.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>Carry out anatomical segmentation according to an existing or tailored protocol for manual region outlining in individual subject space. A full outlining protocol has been described by <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al. (2003)</xref>; other examples include the protocol by <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Shattuck et al. (2008)</xref> and another by <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Filipek et al. (1989)</xref>. A further protocol for cortical labeling is under development as a collaborative project (brainCOLOR<xref rid="fn0020" ref-type="fn">4</xref>). These methods require training of an operator in the chosen protocol and are expensive in terms of operator time and validation requirements, with costs rising approximately linearly with the number of images to be segmented and the number of regions labeled. The resulting segmentations are subject to intraobserver and interobserver variation.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>Use one of a choice of semiautomatic approaches that require manual input, such as landmarks or seed points. Examples are SNT as noted above, Cardviews [Center for Morphometric Analysis, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Rademacher et al., 1992</xref>)], CARET [cortex only, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen, 2005</xref>)] and LDDMM (<xref rid="bb0050 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Beg et al., 2004; Csernansky et al., 2004</xref>). Compared to manual outlining, interobserver variation is reduced, since even if the manual input varies within a certain range, the algorithms tend to arrive at the same results. These approaches are less labor-intensive, but the costs are still closely tied to the number of target images and regions.</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p>Carry out anatomical segmentation in individual space using a fully automatic procedure. Software packages are available that implement the required functionality, but have limitations. For example, Mindboggle (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Klein and Hirsch, 2005</xref>) and its extension using multiple atlases (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2005</xref>) are designed for cortical segmentation only, while the FS + LDDMM method achieves limited accuracy (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2008</xref>). Such approaches typically place a high demand on the computing infrastructure. An exception in this respect is the work by (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Lötjönen et al., 2010</xref>), which is designed to reduce the computational demand sufficiently to make multi-atlas segmentation clinically feasible.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The present work is an instance of the fourth option. We have generated anatomical labels for ADNI MR images and provide them for download along with other ADNI data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI">http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI</ext-link>). We present segmentations of 816 subjects' screening and baseline images into 83 regions, along with a statistical description of regional volumes.</p>
      <p>To obtain automatic segmentations, we used multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration [MAPER, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al. (2010)</xref>]. This is a refined version of a previously validated approach (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al., 2006</xref>). MAPER is the first automatic whole-brain multi-region segmentation method that has been shown to yield robust results in subjects with neurodegenerative disease. It uses training data (“atlases,” images with reference segmentations) to segment T1-weighted brain MR images of any provenance into anatomical regions (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al., 2010</xref>). We showed in previous work (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al., 2006</xref>) that the accuracy achieved with MAPER is only slightly inferior to that of manual segmentation performed by a trained operator, and that the procedure is robust in the face of anatomical variation in the target subjects, specifically ventricular enlargement as seen in aging and neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p>The implementation of MAPER used here relies on software tools sourced from the Image Registration Toolkit [IRTK,<xref rid="fn0025" ref-type="fn">5</xref> <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Rueckert et al. (1999)</xref>] and from Nifty Reg,<xref rid="fn0030" ref-type="fn">6</xref> (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Modat et al., 2010</xref>). In a comparison of tools for intersubject registration of MR brain images, IRTK was recently found to be among the best-performing ones (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2009</xref>). Two other tools [SyN<xref rid="fn0035" ref-type="fn">7</xref> (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Avants et al., 2008</xref>) and ART<xref rid="fn0040" ref-type="fn">8</xref>] (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ardekani et al., 2005</xref>) achieved more consistent results than IRTK in the comparison by Klein et al. Nevertheless, when working with heterogeneous data, we found IRTK to be more robust than ART and SyN, in particular when source (atlas) MR images had been acquired on different scanners than the target data for segmentation [e.g. ADNI images, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al. (2010)</xref>]. ART and SyN have been shown to be suitable for registering pairs of images of identical provenance. MAPER is characterized by its robustness towards ventricular distension in the target subject. To achieve this, it relies on IRTK's ability to register multi-spectral tissue probability maps using cross correlation as the similarity measure, a feature that, to our knowledge, has not been implemented elsewhere. Our choice of IRTK rests on these two factors – robustness towards both intensity differences and typical pathology – although MAPER could in principle be implemented using other toolkits.</p>
      <p>We validate the results using the volumes of the segmented regions as well as agreement measures between segmentations of images that have been serially acquired at different field strengths, and document limitations of the automatic procedure and the generated results for the benefit of future users of the data. We found that signal changes caused by white-matter disease can result in misclassification of tissues and lead to distortions in the segmentations. To quantify this influence, we describe and validate an automatically generated index. Finally, we show that statistical analyses of the automatically generated segmentations confirm previous observations of morphometric changes in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.</p>

        <title>MR data</title>
        <p>Atlas data as required for MAPER consisted of 30 T1-weighted 3D image volumes acquired from healthy young adult volunteers at the National Society for Epilepsy at Chalfont, UK. Details of the acquisition are in <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al. (2003)</xref>. Hand-drawn segmentations of 83 structures had been previously prepared according to the protocols described in <xref rid="bb0140 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al. (2003) and Gousias et al. (2008)</xref>. Segmentation protocols are also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-development.org">http://www.brain-development.org</ext-link>.</p>
        <p>MR images of patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment as well as healthy elderly subjects were obtained from the ADNI database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI">www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI</ext-link>).<xref rid="fn0045" ref-type="fn">9</xref> The research presented here aligns with the primary goal of ADNI, which has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease. The full repository of ADNI images was accessed in February 2010. The clinical information was retrieved in August 2010. Each subject was assigned to one of five diagnosis groups: healthy subjects (HS), mild cognitive impairment with no conversion within the observation period (stable MCI, s-MCI), mild cognitive impairment at baseline, with progress to Alzheimer's disease within the observation period (p-MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Other (O). The latter assignment was used as a “catch-all” for subjects who did not fit the other categories, for example if ADNI noted a reversion from AD to MCI. The observation period was 24 11 months.</p>

      <sec id="s0020">
        <title>Preprocessing</title>
        <p>As envisaged in the ADNI study design, images were obtained from the ADNI database in fully preprocessed versions. Depending on the scanner source, preprocessing included all or some of <italic>GradWarp</italic> geometric distortion correction (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Jovicich et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>B1 nonuniformity correction</italic> to compensate for signal inhomogeneity (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>N3</italic> bias field correction (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Sled et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>phantom scaling</italic>. We chose the originally supplied linearly scaled images, irrespective of problems reported on a subset,<xref rid="fn0050" ref-type="fn">10</xref> as linear scaling issues do not affect the segmentation procedure. Likewise, volume measurements, once normalized by intracranial volume as measured on the same source image, are unaffected by linear scaling.</p>
        <p>To match the requirements of the MAPER procedure, we applied further preprocessing for brain extraction and tissue classification, as described in the following. Utilities used for these steps were taken from the Image Registration Toolkit [IRTK, Rueckert et al. (1999)], from the FSL suite (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2004</xref>) and from the ANTs toolkit (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Avants et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>For the brain extraction step, binary masks covering both intracranial white matter and gray matter (WM + GM) were available as the starting point. These had been generated as part of an earlier project using MIDAS, a semi-automatic procedure described elsewhere (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Freeborough et al., 1997</xref>). Each mask was extended to cover the intracranial region generously by blurring (6 mm Gaussian kernel), thresholding at 27% and hole-filling. FSL FAST was applied to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the pre-masked region. The original WM + GM mask was extended by the resulting CSF mask to obtain a complete intracranial mask that excluded meninges, sinuses and extracranial tissue. The original, semi-automatically created WM + GM mask is fully contained within the intracranial mask, reducing the impact of operator-dependent variability on the intracranial volume measurement.</p>
        <p>Individual tissue probability maps for CSF, GM and WM obtained using FSL FAST were combined into a single multi-spectral volume. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a sample section from an image of a healthy subject. A binary maximum-probability gray matter mask was extracted from the discrete tissue class image generated by FAST.</p>
        <p>T1-weighted screening (1.5 T) and baseline (3 T) images from the ADNI repository were obtained for all subjects for whom MIDAS-prepared brain masks were available. After removing data sets that had been withdrawn by ADNI after the download, a total of 996 images on 816 subjects (1.5 T: 811, 3 T: 185; of which paired: 180) were segmented and quality assessments carried out (cf. <xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Statistical and visual analysis</xref>). For statistical analysis, only subjects in the HS, s-MCI, p-MCI, and AD groups (i.e. excluding the “Other” category), and of these only those who passed the outlier analysis (<xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec">Outlier analysis</xref> section) were included (777 subjects, 953 images, 1.5 T: 772; 3 T: 181, of which paired: 176). The age distribution of included subjects is shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. A breakdown by diagnostic group and gender is given in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the 176 included subjects for whom images had been acquired at both field strengths, the 3 T image was typically acquired within weeks after the 1.5 T image (median 22 days, range 0–112 days).</p>

        <title>Segmentation</title>
        <p>The MAPER procedure for robust, automatic segmentation of T1-weighted MR images of the human brain has been described and validated previously (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al., 2010</xref>). Each target is paired with each of the atlases to generate an individual atlas-based segmentation. The steps are summarized in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In Steps 3 and 4, alignment of details in the image pair was achieved by optimizing a free-form deformation (FFD) represented by displacements on a grid of control points blended using cubic B-splines (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Rueckert et al., 1999</xref>). These steps are carried out using each of the 30 atlases in turn, resulting in 30 segmentations, which are subsequently combined using vote-rule decision fusion (<xref rid="bb0280 bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Rohlfing et al., 2004; Kittler et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast to the approach discussed in <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al. (2010)</xref>, where the entire registration was done in IRTK, we used Nifty Reg Version 1.3 (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Modat et al., 2010</xref>) to carry out the detail-level registration (Step 4). The transformed and interpolated output from IRTK was used as the starting point. Nifty Reg is a particularly efficient implementation of the same FFD registration. To compare the accuracy of MAPER based on the combination (IRTK and Nifty Reg) with MAPER based on pure IRTK, we carried out a leave-one-out cross-comparison on the 30 atlas sets with both implementations, following the method described in <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al. (2010)</xref>. Agreement between the generated and the manual label sets was measured using the mean Jaccard coefficient [<italic>JC</italic>; intersection divided by union (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Jaccard, 1901</xref>)] across all 83 regions. The mean <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> across the 30 atlas images was 0.691 for both methods [range 0.653–0.714, SD 0.0141 (IRTK), range 0.664–0.711, SD 0.0134 (IRTK and Nifty Reg)].</p>

        <title>Quantifying white-matter disease</title>
        <p>White-matter disease (WMD), characterized by diffusely hypointense regions within the white matter, is frequently seen in elderly subjects, and specifically in those with dementia (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Black et al., 2009</xref>). Such regions can adversely affect the functioning of intensity-based methods. In the case of FSL FAST, they tend to be incorrectly labeled as gray matter, and this can impact subsequent processing — in the case of MAPER, resulting segmentations can be distorted. In particular, the lateral ventricle, the caudate nucleus, and the insula can be overestimated (cf. <xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec">Outlier analysis</xref>). We developed a procedure to estimate the amount of white matter that is misclassified. The estimate is derived from a set of different label images derived from the T1-weighted image:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>•</label><p>A binary WM segmentation of the target by majority vote fusion of transformed atlas WM segmentations (each estimated from their intensities by FAST; note the atlas subjects are healthy young adults not affected by WMD): <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>W</italic></sub></p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>A binary GM segmentation of the target generated with FAST: <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub></p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>A semi-automatically generated binary label covering white matter and gray matter of the target, as described in <xref rid="s0020" ref-type="sec">Preprocessing</xref> section: <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub></p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>A binary segmentation of both lateral ventricles in the target extracted from the fusion of the transformed atlas labels: <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>V</italic></sub></p></list-item></list></p>

        <p>In subjects where WMD leads to hypointensities that coincide with white matter, as identified by transforming atlas WM segmentations, such regions will be labeled by the intermediate Image <italic>A</italic>. In subjects where hypointensities border on the lateral ventricles, Image <italic>B</italic> will capture the affected regions. The volume of the resulting label <italic>W</italic>, normalized by the intracranial volume, provides an indication of the subject's WMD load. In the following, we refer to this measure as the white-matter hypointensities index (WMHI).</p>
        <p>We assessed the validity of the WMHI by comparison with a semiquantitative rating. We adapted the rating scale described by <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Wahlund et al.

        <p>The WMHI distribution was highly nonlinear with a small number of high values. To select a subset for visual scoring, we ranked the images according to WMHI, divided the sample into three equal parts, and sampled in a proportion of 42:21:7 from each group, yielding a total of 70 images for review.<xref rid="fn0055" ref-type="fn">11</xref> An experienced rater (AH) who was blinded to WMHI, age, and diagnosis assigned the score after reviewing the T1-weighted images in three orthogonal planes. Where subjectively appropriate, based on comparisons within the sample, the rater assigned a tendency to the score, which was recorded as an addition or subtraction of 0.3 points to or from the integer score.</p>

        <title>Masking based on tissue class</title>
        <p>Depending on the application, it may be desirable to use segmented regions that have been multiplied with a binary tissue class label. In particular, since aging and Alzheimer's disease are characterized by cortical neuronal loss, the GM portion within each cortical label is often more relevant than the full label containing both GM and WM. We thus provide both raw segmentation data and masked versions. For the latter, regions with a substantial GM portion have been masked with a GM label (all except ventricles, central structures, cerebellum and brainstem), and the lateral ventricles have been masked with a CSF label. Unless otherwise noted, the analysis results reported in this work are based on the masked label sets.</p>

        <p>Segmentation failures typically lead to grossly inaccurate estimations of the volume of individual regions. To detect outliers in the data, we grouped the images by diagnosis, gender and field strength, and determined per-group means and standard deviations of the regional volume (normalized by intracranial volume; masked by GM except for ventricles, central structures, brainstem and cerebellum). On this basis, all region volumes were converted to <italic>z</italic> scores. Regions where the <italic>z</italic> score was greater than 4 or less than − 4 were flagged as outliers. Images containing outlier regions were visually assessed by an experienced reader (RAH). Label outlines were superimposed on the MRI image and the flagged region and its neighborhood viewed in the transverse, sagittal and coronal planes. The segmentation quality was rated on a visual analog scale from 1 to 5 (1: failed segmentation; 2: poor boundary matching, but correct indication of the relative position of neighboring regions; 3: fair; 4: good segmentation with minor boundary mismatches, 5: excellent segmentation with exact boundary matching). The likely cause of the outlying size of the region, based on the reader's subjective impression, was identified and recorded. The remainder of the image was searched in the transverse plane for obvious label mismatches beyond the flagged region and a note of the overall impression recorded.</p>

        <title>Outlier analysis</title>
        <p>Sixty regions in 42 subjects met the outlier criterion and were reviewed visually. Twelve subjects appeared twice in the list, two subjects appeared three times and one appeared four times. The regions that appeared most frequently in the outlier list were the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (8 right, 6 left), the caudate nucleus (7 right, 5 left), and the subcallosal area (2 right, 4 left).</p>
        <p>On visual review, the flagged regions appeared to be affected by white-matter disease in a large number of cases (WMD: 24; other flawed segmentations: 19, correct: 17). In 13 of the 19 problematic segmentations that were not WMD-related, the flaw appeared to be limited to the region in question. No further segmentation problems were detected in these cases, and the extent of over- or undersegmentation was deemed to be mild or moderate (scoring 3 or 4 on the visual analog scale described in <xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Statistical and visual analysis</xref> section). In the remaining six regions, more general problems were seen and the relevant four cases (I64189, I38944, I67210, and I91126) were excluded from further analysis (MR acquisition problems leading to lack of GM/WM contrast: four regions in three images; motion artifact: two regions in one image).</p>
        <p>WMD is a highly prevalent feature in the subjects of this cohort, frequently leading to overestimation of the caudate nuclei and the insula regions. The gray-matter portion of labels of other cortical regions often included white-matter regions that had been mistaken for gray matter by the tissue classification. Subcortical regions other than the caudate nuclei appeared largely unaffected on visual review. We determined for each image an index (cf. Quantifying white matter disease section) that signals WMD load. This index correlates well with the visual appearance of distortion (cf. Measuring WMD using white-matter hypointensities index). It is provided with the label images as part of the metadata.</p>
        <p>The raw MAPER-based label for the lateral ventricle is frequently overestimated, incorrectly including hypointense portions of white matter. We dealt with this issue by masking this region pair with the binary CSF label generated by FAST.</p>
        <p>While MAPER is robust in the majority of cases, the limitations of automatic segmentation (and, indeed, manual segmentation) need to be considered in subjects whose anatomical configuration is severely abnormal and in those who show texture abnormalities such as white matter disease.</p>

        <title>Measuring WMD using the white-matter hypointensities index</title>
        <p>The WMHI ranged from 0 (seen in 135/996 images) to 151, with the distribution strongly skewed towards 0. The distribution is best visualized using a log scale as shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> plots the rater score against WMHI. The measures are strongly correlated (Kendall rank correlation coefficient 0.71, significant at the limit of numeric precision), although there is some overlap of WMHI between adjacent score groups. One image (I79803) received a visual score of 0, although it scored high on WMHI (7.59). Review of the MR image along with the intermediate Image <italic>A</italic> showing hypointensities showed an artefactual step change of intensity in the MR along the vertical axis, which resulted in a hypointense white matter region in the brainstem. No other white matter regions where highlighted or visibly affected by white matter disease.</p>
        <p>The WMHI is intended to alert users to possible WMD-related oversegmentation when susceptible region labels are used for analysis. Such regions include the lateral ventricles before CSF-masking, the caudate nucleus and the gray-matter masked cortical regions, especially the insula. The WMHI has some value as a metadatum indicating the reliability of the segmentation. With a view to the caudate nucleus, however, its value is limited due to the way the index is generated: hypointensities adjacent to the caudate nucleus tend to be included in the generated caudate label, in which case they are not identified as WMD. Thus, it is possible for a caudate nucleus to be oversegmented due to white matter disease, even when the WMHI is zero. Random visual reviews have revealed one image where this appears to be the case (I63489). In future work, we will seek to address the issue of WMD-related oversegmentation in a principled fashion by identifying affected subjects and regions a priori and counteracting the distorting effects at the registration step. We will also search for better criteria to indicate the overall veracity of the generated segmentations.</p>

          <title>Normalization</title>
          <p>To reduce interindividual variation of region volumes, various measures have been proposed for normalization (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Free et al., 1995</xref>). In particular, normalization of brain volume by intracranial volume was found to substantially reduce variation, and to remove gender-related differences (<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2001</xref>). We found in previous work a correlation between hippocampal volume and ICV (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al., 2007</xref>), and this was confirmed in the present data (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.56 for the sum of both hippocampi in 1.5 T images of healthy subjects). Normalization by ICV also eliminates inaccuracies arising from problems with the phantom scaling, which have been reported for a subset of ADNI cases (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
          <p>Our ICV measurements were stable across the diagnostic groups (cf. <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Based on a two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Schuirmann, 1987</xref>), the null hypothesis of non-equivalence can be rejected for all paired comparisons of diagnosis groups, except (s-MCI, AD) where <italic>p</italic> = 0.056 (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05; <italic>ε</italic> = 0.05<italic>μ</italic>). In the following, individual region sizes are expressed as a fraction of ICV, scaled by an arbitrary factor of 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>
          <p>The benefit of ICV normalization can be seen in group comparisons by diagnosis: the absolute total gray matter volume differs between groups, but the distinction is comparatively weak (cf. <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, left panel).

The amygdala, the middle and inferior temporal gyrus and the fusiform gyrus are reduced in size, adding to the evidence that temporal lobe regions beyond the hippocampus are affected by the disease process. The amygdala is functionally connected with and spatially adjacent to the hippocampus, and its involvement in AD is well known from histopathology (<xref rid="bb0235 bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Kromer Vogt et al., 1990; Scott et al., 1991</xref>) and imaging research (<xref rid="bb0095 bb0180 bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Cuénod et al., 1993; Jack et al., 1997; Lehericy et al., 1994</xref>).

This finding may indicate a limitation of accuracy of the putamen segmentation in subjects with more advanced disease.</p>
          <p>The heatmap in <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> indicates for each region and selected pairs of diagnostic categories the extent to which the measured volume can serve to distinguish the diagnosis groups. Red color indicates the “most significant” results in each column. Please note that p-values in this context are not used for the usual purpose of hypothesis testing, but for comparing regions; therefore we did not employ alpha thresholding or attempt correction for multiple comparisons. Regions in the mesial temporal lobe (hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyri) are particularly prominent, along with the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle and the posterior temporal lobe. Outside of the temporal lobe, large posterior cortical regions (parietal lobe, occipital lobe) are highlighted. These observations align well with previously described AD patterns, specifically a posterior-to-anterior gradient in atrophy (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Likeman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

          <title>Asymmetry</title>
          <p>Generally, AD atrophy is described as a disseminated process with no lateral predilection. Regional counts of plaques and tangles in pathological specimens showed larger variability within one and the same region than between left and right counterparts (<xref rid="bb0190 bb0260 bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Janota and Mountjoy, 1988; Moossy et al., June, 1989; Wilcock and Esiri, 1987</xref>). Imaging studies comparing AD with other entities found that asymmetry indices may be a useful tool for differential diagnosis, as asymmetry of various regions frequently attends clinically similar conditions, specifically frontotemporal lobar degeneration (<xref rid="bb0045 bb0060 bb0165 bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2006; Boccardi et al., 2003; Horínek et al., 2007; Likeman et al., 2005</xref>) and argyrophilic grain disease (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 2010</xref>). As a differential diagnostic criterion, asymmetry thus speaks against AD according to these studies.</p>
          <p>For the hippocampus, a physiological right-larger-than-left asymmetry in healthy adults is well established [e.g. <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Pedraza et al., (2004)</xref>], but studies focussing on hippocampal asymmetry in AD have yielded varying results. Small lateral differences in atrophy rates between AD patients and controls were found by <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al. (2005)</xref>. <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. (2007)</xref>, focussing on shape characteristics rather than volume, also found small differences between AD and controls in the atrophy pattern. A metastudy on hippocampal volume found that right hippocampal volume was larger than left in all groups studied (AD, MCI and controls), with AD subjects showing smaller effect sizes due to larger variation (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Barber et al. (2001)</xref> report a loss of hippocampal asymmetry in AD patients versus controls. An increase in hippocampal asymmetry as a function of cognitive decline was seen in one study (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
          <p>In the present study, results for the hippocampal left/right volume ratio have a wide distribution. We therefore choose to report the median and the median absolute deviation (MD), which are more robust measures of central tendency and dispersion than means and standard deviations. For healthy subjects, we found the previously reported pattern of left&lt;right hippocampal asymmetry (median L/R volume ratio 0.93; MD 0.073). In AD, the median of the volume ratio appears to be somewhat reduced (0.90; MD 0.12), but the difference is not significant. The balanced asymmetry index <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is higher in AD than in healthy subjects (0.12 versus 0.08), and this difference is significant (<italic>p</italic> = 1.3 × 10<sup>− 5</sup>).</p>
          <p>Few studies have looked at asymmetry in AD beyond the hippocampus. The amygdala has been studied by <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al. (2005)</xref>, who found a significant increase of asymmetry in AD patients. <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. (1998)</xref> found asymmetries in the Sylvian fissure in normal subjects, and these were significantly accentuated in AD.</p>
          <p>We note that <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is particularly large in AD compared to HS when considering large regions (posterior temporal lobe, HS: 0.041, AD: 0.092, <italic>p</italic> = 1.3 × 10<sup>− 15</sup>, parietal lobe, HS: 0.068, AD: 0.100, <italic>p</italic> at limit of precision, cf. <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This is an area for future exploration.</p>

        <title>Consistency across field strengths</title>
        <p>High levels of agreement were seen when comparing the segmentation obtained on a 1.5 T image with that obtained on the same subject's 3 T image. The aggregate measure across all structures showed little variation between subjects (<italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> 0.802 ± 0.0146, range 0.749–0.829; corresponding to a DSC of 0.890). Results were equivalent for all four disease conditions as shown by a TOST procedure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-17 for <italic>α</italic> = 0.05 and <italic>ε</italic> = 0.04). In previous work, we used the <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> measure to assess MAPER with reference to manual segmentation in normal adults (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Heckemann et al., 2010</xref>), obtaining a mean of 0.691 (DSC 0.817). The fact that the MAPER method produces consistent results across field strengths indicates high precision and corroborates our previous findings showing the accuracy of the method.</p>
        <p>Between individual regions, we note large differences in the standard deviation of the Jaccard coefficient (<italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub>). This standard deviation, here expressed as a percentage of the mean, ranges from 1.4% (brainstem) to 17.7% (left pallidum). Labels of regions that are well-defined by gray-scale intensity gradients in the T1 image are particularly consistent across field strengths. <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub> for, e.g., the frontal horn and central part of the lateral ventricle is 3.0% (either side). For the precentral gyrus, which is a cortical region of average size within our set, <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub> is 2.3% (left) and 2.5% (right). Small regions with weakly defined boundaries are naturally difficult to segment, both manually and by automatic procedures based on manual input. In the present results, this is reflected in large standard deviation values for the pallidum (<italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub> left: 17.7%, right: 14.3%) and the nucleus accumbens (left: 12.9%, right: 11.0%).</p>

        <title>Precision based on atlas subsets</title>
        <p>There was strong agreement between independent atlas-subset based segmentations of the target images (<italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> was 0.800 ± 0.0092, range 0.771–0.819, corresponding to a DSC of 0.889). Three outliers were seen out of 996, one of each in the HS (I64867, <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> 0.765), s-MCI (I69360, <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> 0.718) and p-MCI (I97327, <italic>JC</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> 0.755) groups. On visual review of the corresponding segmentations, no substantial mislabelling was seen.</p>

        <title>Future improvements</title>
        <p>The choice of the segmentation approach employed in this work was guided by multiple considerations and represents a compromise that can be improved upon in future work. An important factor was proved robustness, as it helped to ensure that all segmentation results are traceable to a single procedure, and helped to avoid any individualized modification of the output data. As a consequence, a variety of recently published algorithmic developments have not been considered and may lead to even more accurate and detailed segmentations, once their robustness has been demonstrated. Promising developments are taking place in several areas. Registration algorithms are becoming more accurate and efficient as shown by <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Lötjönen et al. (2010)</xref> (albeit only for image pairs of identical provenance). The dependence on expensive expert input may in the future be reduced thanks to algorithms that uncover latent atlases (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Riklin-Raviv et al., 2010</xref>). Procedures that select or weight atlas images from the outset (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Aljabar et al., 2009</xref>) or at the segmentation combining stage (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Artaechevarria et al., 2009</xref>) may yield more accurate results, especially when heterogeneous repositories are used as atlas data. Algorithms that revisit the image data after segmentation in order to refine the result are showing strong promise (<xref rid="bb0390 bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Wolz et al., 2010b; van der Lijn et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>A further compromise was made with regard to the choice of the atlas data. We settled on a set that has been segmented in high detail and with strong validation (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hammers et al., 2003</xref>), although it is based on young adults and is therefore demographically dissimilar from the ADNI target images. Work by <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Wolz et al. (2010a)</xref> shows for individual regions that the LEAP approach – propagating atlas labels indirectly via intermediate images – can yield improved results on such dissimilar targets. The question of how LEAP or a similar approach can be adapted for multiple regions is another promising research avenue.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this work we present a repository of label data on healthy elderly subjects and patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. We offer segmentations of 996 screening and baseline images in 816 subjects. The data are publicly available as an accompaniment to the MRI data supplied by the ADNI project. We validated the segmentation results and presented results of statistical analysis that are congruent with established knowledge about atrophy progression in AD.</p>
      <p>We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the repository with findings from future research. In particular, we envisage developing further indices of accuracy and adding them as metadata. As improvements to the segmentation algorithm are developed and validated, we are planning to add updated segmentations, using versioning to ensure that the original set described here remains available for reference. If members of the community should express an interest in segmentations of follow-up scans, such data will also be added.</p>
      <p>For researchers working with ADNI data, the repository will provide reliable information on a large number of anatomical regions. We envisage that the segmentations be used to search for novel imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and progressive mild cognitive impairment, using regional volume, shape, and texture information that can be derived. Our data will also enable region-based analysis of the functional imaging data acquired using positron-emission tomography, and of the connectivity data acquired using diffusion tensor imaging in the respective subsets.</p>

        <p>ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public–private partnership. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., VA Medical Center and University of California San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research — approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.</p>

        <p>Originally, we had sampled 21 evenly from the ranked list. Based on the review of this original set, we decided to increase the sample size. The trisection approach allowed us to add to the existing sample, while maintaining even spacing within the parts and emphasizing the upper WMHI value range, where we expected the findings to be most relevant.</p>

        <p>Regional volumes and volume differences. Column “HS vol” shows regional volume as a fraction of ICV, averaged across healthy subjects, scaled by 10<sup>4</sup>. Columns labeled “d()” show the volume difference compared to HS as a percentage of HSvol, except “d(pMCI, sMCI)”, which shows the volume difference between p-MCI and s-MCI as a percentage of the mean volume of the s-MCI group. The sort criterion is the modulus of the difference between AD and HS. Only the 14 regions ranking highest on the sort criterion are shown. “Code” is the numerical identifier for the region used in the label maps.</p>
