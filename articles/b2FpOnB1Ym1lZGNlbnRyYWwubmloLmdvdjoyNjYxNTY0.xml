        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein SufI (FtsP) has recently been proposed to be a component of the cell division apparatus. The SufI protein is also in widespread experimental use as a model substrate in studies of the Tat (twin arginine translocation) protein transport system. We have used SufI-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusions to show that SufI localizes to the septal ring in the dividing cell. We have also determined the structure of SufI by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.9 Å. SufI is structurally related to the multicopper oxidase superfamily but lacks metal cofactors. The structure of SufI suggests it serves a scaffolding rather than an enzymatic role in the septal ring and reveals regions of the protein likely to be involved in the protein–protein interactions required to assemble SufI at the septal ring.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Currently, around 20 cell division genes have been identified in the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (reviewed in Refs. <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref>). Most of these genes have the designation <italic>fts</italic>, which stands for ‘filamentation temperature sensitive’ and reflects the fact that the first <italic>E. coli</italic> division genes were discovered in screens for mutants that divided normally at 30 °C but became filamentous and ultimately died at 42 °C. The <italic>fts</italic> genes share two critical properties. Firstly, loss-of-function mutations cause division defects. Secondly, the proteins encoded by these genes all localize to the midcell where they form a structure called the septal ring (also termed the divisome or septalsome). Many investigators regard the septal ring as an organelle that mediates cytokinesis. It assembles at the midcell prior to division and then constricts as division proceeds so as to remain at the leading edge of the developing septum.</p>
      <p>Samaluru <italic>et al.</italic> have recently shown that the <italic>E. coli</italic> gene <italic>sufI</italic> has several properties of an <italic>fts</italic> gene.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> They have proposed renaming the gene <italic>ftsP</italic> to emphasize its role in division and to avoid confusion with <italic>suf</italic> genes involved in assembly of iron–sulfur clusters.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> <italic>sufI</italic> was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of an <italic>ftsI</italic>(Ts) mutation, with the <italic>sufI</italic> designation standing for ‘suppression of <italic>ftsI</italic>(Ts)’.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> FtsI, also known as penicillin-binding protein 3, is a transpeptidase involved in synthesis of peptidoglycan cell wall during cell division.<xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9–12</sup></xref> Reddy and colleagues demonstrated several additional division-related phenotypes associated with <italic>sufI</italic>, the most noteworthy being that a <italic>sufI</italic> null mutant is filamentous when grown at elevated temperature in media lacking osmotic protectants such as NaCl.<xref rid="bib7 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,13</sup></xref> Thus, <italic>sufI</italic> acts like an <italic>fts</italic> gene, but whether it is part of the septal ring that mediates cell division remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>SufI is a water-soluble, periplasmic protein.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The sequence of SufI shows that it is a member of the multicopper oxidase superfamily.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, the SufI sequence conserves only 2 of the 12 canonical copper-binding residues found in multicopper oxidases and this has led to the prediction that SufI does not bind metal cofactors.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In addition to its involvement in cell division, SufI is of considerable interest due to its use as a model substrate in studies of the bacterial Tat (twin arginine translocation) protein transport pathway. The Tat system is used to transport folded substrate proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm across the cytoplasmic membrane (reviewed in Refs. <xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref>). SufI has a number of favourable properties for mechanistic studies of Tat transport relative to that of other <italic>E. coli</italic> Tat substrates, including that it is water soluble, monomeric, and does not require insertion of a cofactor during folding. These properties have led to the adoption of SufI as the preferred model substrate in Tat translocation studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>.<xref rid="bib15 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,20–30</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In this study, we examine whether SufI/FtsP resembles other Fts proteins in localizing to the division septum. We also determine the structure of SufI/FtsP with the aim of providing additional insight into the molecular function of the protein, as well as a structural basis for studying the interactions of SufI with other cell division proteins and with the Tat translocation apparatus.</p>

        <title>Fusion of SufI to green fluorescent protein</title>
        <p>Recent genetic evidence<xref rid="bib7 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,13</sup></xref> has demonstrated a role for SufI in protecting and stabilizing the divisional assembly under conditions of stress. Specifically the evidence implies that SufI may be a septal ring protein.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we sought to develop green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of SufI that would allow the subcellular localization of SufI under normal growth conditions to be determined. To this end we constructed separate IPTG-inducible fusions of <italic>gfp</italic> to the 5′ or 3′ ends of <italic>sufI</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). We term the protein products of these genes GFP-SufI and SufI-GFP, respectively. The fusion constructs were integrated into the chromosome in a single copy at the attachment site for phage φ80 in both a wild-type and a <italic>sufI&lt;&gt;aph</italic> null mutant background. Isogenic strains that expressed <italic>gfp</italic> alone were constructed as controls. It is important to note that GFP does not function in the periplasm unless exported via the Tat system.<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31–33</sup></xref> Because SufI is a Tat substrate, no precautions had to be taken to direct the SufI-GFP fusion to the Tat pathway. However, for the GFP-SufI protein and for GFP alone, a Tat signal sequence from TorA was incorporated at the N-terminus of the protein during the cloning steps.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The functionality of the fusion proteins was assessed by determining whether they could complement the division defects of a <italic>sufI&lt;&gt;aph</italic> null mutant (obtained from the Keio collection<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>). When grown in standard LB containing 10 g NaCl per liter, the <italic>sufI</italic> mutant exhibited normal morphology, consistent with earlier reports.<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8,13</sup></xref> However, when grown in the absence of NaCl (LB0N medium), about 20% of the cells exhibited division defects that resulted in the appearance of short filaments or chains of up to three to four cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Division defects were more pronounced at 37 °C than at 30 °C and were confirmed after eviction of the Kan<sup>r</sup> cassette to create a markerless <italic>sufI&lt;&gt;frt</italic> deletion strain (not shown). Introduction of either the <italic>gfp-sufI</italic> or <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> fusions into the <italic>sufI&lt;&gt;aph</italic> strain ameliorated the division defect observed in LB0N, with the <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> fusion giving essentially complete complementation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, both GFP fusion constructs retain the functionality of SufI. Immunoblotting these strains with anti-GFP revealed major cross-reactive bands at 75 kDa consistent with the calculated mass of 75 kDa for the SufI/GFP fusions after removal of their Tat signal peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). The immunoblot of GFP-SufI also revealed a band at about 60 kDa. Analysis of purified SufI (described below) shows that a surface loop is susceptible to clipping between residues 307–308. Cleavage at this site would produce a truncated GFP-SufI(307) with a predicted mass of 58 kDa, which correlates well with the size of the GFP-containing fragment observed in the blot. It is important to note that clipping of the surface loop does not affect the integrity of the SufI protein because the two fragments remain associated, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the clipped protein is transport competent and functional.</p>

        <title>SufI is localized to the septal ring</title>
        <p>The fusion proteins were tested for septal localization by fluorescence microscopy of live cells on an agarose pad. SufI-GFP and GFP-SufI clearly accumulated at the division site in about half of the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This was true regardless of whether the cells were grown in LB containing or lacking NaCl (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Almost all of the cells exhibiting septal localization of SufI had readily apparent constrictions. Septal localization was not observed when cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde (not shown). In fixed cells, only uniform periplasmic fluorescence was observed. Sensitivity to fixation has been observed previously with other periplasmic division proteins such as AmiC.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Division mutants sometimes have an enlarged periplasmic space. This can lead to the enrichment of periplasmic GFP signal at division sites even when the GFP fusion protein in question does not localize to the septal ring.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> To address this concern, we also localized periplasmic GFP that was not fused to another protein. As expected, isolated GFP was more uniformly distributed throughout the periplasm than GFP fused to SufI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This finding argues that septal localization of the GFP/SufI fusions is not an artifact and that any division defect in the <italic>sufI</italic> null mutant is too subtle to result in an enlarged periplasmic space (at least under these growth conditions and with this assay). It should also be noted that GFP-SufI and SufI-GFP also clearly localized to the midcell in a wild-type background, which would not be expected to have an enlarged periplasmic space (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The periplasmic location of Tat-targeted GFP in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> is evident from the fluorescent halo around the cells. Because neither GFP-SufI nor SufI-GFP showed a similar halo, it was not immediately obvious that those proteins were also periplasmic, although the complementation and septal localization data implied that both fusion proteins had to have reached the periplasm. We suspected the lack of a fluorescent halo in cells producing GFP-SufI or SufI-GFP was due to the low abundance of these proteins as evident from Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). Indeed, when GFP-SufI and SufI-GFP were produced from multicopy plasmids, the expected halos were readily apparent (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, in a Tat mutant, both GFP-SufI fluorescence and SufI-GFP fluorescence were exclusively cytoplasmic and septal localization was not observed (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, these observations confirm that GFP-SufI and SufI-GFP were exported to the periplasm by the Tat system. Because we were concerned that the chaining phenotype of Tat mutants<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> might obscure septal localization, we also examined GFP fusions to the well-characterized division proteins FtsZ, FtsI and FtsN. All three localized to potential division sites (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, production of GFP-FtsI in the Tat mutant inhibited division, while production of GFP-FtsN appeared to promote more frequent division.</p>

        <title>Recruitment of SufI to the septal ring depends on FtsN</title>
        <p>The septal ring contains 10 proteins that are essential for cell division. Studies of how these essential proteins depend on one another for recruitment to the septal ring have established a set of relationships that suggests the ring assembles by sequential addition of proteins, starting with FtsZ and ending with FtsN (reviewed in Refs. <xref rid="bib3 bib5" ref-type="bibr">3, 5</xref> and <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To determine where SufI fits into this hierarchy, we examined localization of SufI-GFP in filamentous cells that could not divide because FtsZ, FtsQ, FtsL or FtsN had been either inactivated or removed by depletion. Notably, loss of any one of these division proteins prevented SufI-GFP from accumulating at potential division sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that SufI is a late recruit to the septal ring.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Crystal structure of SufI</title>
        <p>In an attempt to gain further functional insights about SufI, the structure of overproduced, hexahistidine-tagged SufI was determined by X-ray crystallography. SufI crystallized in two crystal forms (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the homologous <italic>E. coli</italic> CueO protein [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID <ext-link xlink:href="1PF3" ext-link-type="gen">1PF3</ext-link>]<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> as the search model. Both the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystal forms contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a common dimer interface surface of 921 Å calculated by the MSD-PISA server.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> SufI elutes from a size-exclusion chromatography column at the position expected for a monomer. In addition, analysis of the dimer interface with the MSD-PISA server gave a complexation significance score of zero. This implies that the interface is not significant and most likely arises from crystal packing.</p>
        <p>The two molecules of each asymmetric unit are essentially the same within experimental error (rmsds over 408 and 406 C<sup>α</sup> atoms of 1.1 and 0.9 Å for the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals, respectively). Of the two data sets, the orthorhombic crystals diffracted to higher resolution (1.9 Å compared to 2.6 Å). The overall structure of SufI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a) is very similar to that of CueO and contains three cupredoxin-like domains. These domains consist of a beta sandwich made up of seven strands in two beta sheets, although some variations may have one or two additional strands. The beta sheets are found in variations of the Greek key beta barrel, which have some of the beta strands adjacent in space despite not being adjacent in sequence. As with CueO, SufI has a long linker peptide between domains two and three that runs around the surface of the molecule.</p>
        <p>Due to proteolysis, the SufI preparation used for crystallization is missing the first 17 amino acids of the 27-amino-acid N-terminal Tat signal peptide. The remaining 10 amino acids of the signal peptide are not ordered in any of the crystal forms. Previous circular dichroism studies of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SufI signal peptide have shown that it lacks a defined secondary structure in aqueous solution,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> which suggests that even if the full-length signal peptide were present it would be disordered. Other residues missing from the final model are listed in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In all the models, there is missing density for residues 296–311, which include the region where SufI is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (above). No electron density was observed for the hexahistidine affinity tag, with the exception of the arginine residue of the affinity tag linker in chain A of the orthorhombic structure. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c shows electron density representative of the quality of the data and phases.</p>
        <p>The main areas of difference between the two crystal forms lie between residues 42–47, 55–66 and 326–334. Residues 42–47 are found in a loop that leads into the first domain, while residues 326–334 compose the long linker between domains 2 and 3. The electron density for both of these regions was poor and often missing entirely for the side chains. This suggests that these differences between the two crystal forms arise from flexibility of the molecule in these regions. Residues 55–66 are found in an extended loop in the first domain: a short alpha-helical segment is present in this loop in the orthorhombic form, which is unravelled in the monoclinic form.</p>

        <title>SufI belongs to the multicopper oxidase family of proteins but does not bind copper</title>
        <p>The crystal structure coordinates of a SufI monomer were submitted to the DALI server.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> The closest structural relative identified by the DALI server is <italic>E. coli</italic> CueO, with a <italic>Z</italic>-score of 53. An overlay of the two structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b) has an rmsd of 1.46 Å over 406 C<sup>α</sup> atoms.</p>
        <p>CueO contains four copper atoms, which are found in a mononuclear type I (T1) copper centre and a trinuclear copper centre. SufI lacks all but two of the copper-binding residues found in CueO and has been assumed not to bind copper.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Consistent with this prediction, no electron density corresponding to copper atoms was observed in the SufI structure. The absence of bound copper or other metals in the SufI structure was confirmed by calculating an anomalous difference density Fourier map using CCP4-FFT, which failed to identify any significant peaks.</p>
        <p>The ability of SufI to bind metals could not be ruled out due to the use of metal chelate affinity chromatography during the purification protocol, which might remove bound metal ions from the protein. However, soaking of SufI crystals with a cocktail of metal ions did not result in the identification of any metal-binding sites, and using the CHED server<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> to detect/predict metal binding sites also failed to identify any putative sites.</p>
        <p>In CueO, the T1 centre is slightly buried within domain 3.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a shows the T1 copper centre in CueO overlaid onto the corresponding region in SufI. This illustrates how the N and S donor ligands favoured by copper have been almost totally replaced by O donor ligands in SufI. The trinuclear copper centre of CueO is located between domains 1 and 3 (Ref. <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and a water-filled cavity is found at the equivalent position in SufI. In CueO, the trinuclear centre is coordinated by eight histidine residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b). All but two of these histidine residues have been replaced in SufI with amino acids that would not normally be expected to coordinate copper (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). The two histidine residues retained in SufI are residues that in CueO ligate two different atoms of the trinuclear copper centre. In the SufI crystal structures these two histidines are bridged by a water molecule.</p>
        <p>A further difference between the CueO and SufI structures is the absence, in SufI, of the methionine-rich helix and loop, the so-called tower of the CueO structure. This region sits over the T1 copper site in CueO<xref rid="bib38 bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38,45</sup></xref> and constitutes an additional copper-binding site.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Taken together, these limited sequence differences are sufficient to destroy the ability to bind copper, leading to the unusual situation of highly homologous proteins with very different biological functions.</p>

        <title>Identification of potential functionally important regions of SufI</title>
        <p>In an attempt to identify structural features that might be relevant to the specific function of SufI, we looked for residues that are conserved between SufI proteins from different organisms but are not found in CueO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This approach identified two regions of particular note. The first, close to the N terminus at residues 41–47, is the motif ExRRGxP. Unfortunately, the density in this region, especially around the two arginines, is poor or missing in the models. This implies that the loop is very flexible, which could be important for any functional role it may play. The second region of interest is focussed on residues 118–128 in domain 1. Glycine residues at positions 114 and 115 of <italic>E. coli</italic> SufI are conserved in both SufI and CueO. In <italic>E. coli</italic> CueO, these glycine residues form part of a DGX motif conserved amongst all multicopper oxidases, which sits at the bottom of a surface-accessible region directly above the trinuclear copper centre (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a) and is implicated in binding of dioxygen and, potentially, proton donation.<xref rid="bib50 bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50,51</sup></xref> However, in the SufI structure, the conserved residues arginine 118, tryptophan 126 and proline 128 are positioned in the space above the same glycines, occluding access from the surface of the molecule (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). This is additional evidence that the SufI molecule has lost the ability to accept ligands and/or substrates in the pocket that in CueO accommodates the Cu centre.</p>
        <p>Using the WHISCY server,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> we examined the surface conservation of SufI residues in an attempt to identify regions of the molecular surface that may be involved in protein–protein interactions. We found a large number of conserved residues clustered to one face of SufI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c), including the conserved residues 41–47 discussed above (indicated by a black star in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c). Given the role of SufI as a cell division protein and its localization to the septal ring during cell division, we speculate that this conserved face represents a binding site for interaction with other Fts proteins.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we show that both N- and C-terminal SufI/GFP fusions accumulate at the division site in constricting cells. Such localization is characteristic of Fts proteins and supports the proposal of Reddy and colleagues that SufI is a <italic>bona fide</italic> Fts protein.<xref rid="bib7 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,13</sup></xref> Interestingly, SufI localized to the septal ring regardless of whether NaCl was present in the growth medium, implying that SufI is not recruited to the ring in response to stress. The observation that <italic>sufI</italic> mutants are sensitive to stress probably reflects redundancy rather than a specific function for SufI in protecting the divisional apparatus from stress.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Studies of Fts protein localization in various mutant backgrounds revealed that, at least in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the septal ring assembles via a largely linear pathway (reviewed in Refs. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">5 and 6</xref>). Here we have shown that SufI is a late recruit to the septal ring, as its localization depends on FtsZ, FtsQ, FtsL and FtsN. In this context, it is important to note that FtsN is the last known essential division protein recruited to the septal ring. Two additional observations also argue that SufI is a late recruit. First, septal localization was observed in only about half of the cells, which were growing with a doubling time of about 40 min. This percentage is similar to the ‘late’ proteins FtsN and AmiC.<xref rid="bib34 bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,52</sup></xref> In contrast, ‘early’ proteins such as FtsZ and FtsA show septal localization in 70–90% of the cells.<xref rid="bib53 bib54 bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53–55</sup></xref> Second, almost all of the cells exhibiting localization were already constricting, which raises the intriguing possibility that an event associated with the onset of cytokinesis (rather than the mere presence of a protein in the septal ring) is involved in SufI recruitment.</p>
      <p>SufI is the fourth soluble periplasmic protein shown to localize to the septal ring. The other three proteins are AmiC, EnvC and TolB.<xref rid="bib34 bib36 bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,36,56</sup></xref> The latter is part of the trans-envelope Tol–Pal complex implicated in facilitating constriction of the outer membrane during cytokinesis.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> AmiC and EnvC are both peptidoglycan hydrolases.<xref rid="bib36 bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36,57</sup></xref> Localization of TolB and AmiC to septal ring assemblies requires FtsN, as reported here for SufI.<xref rid="bib34 bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,56</sup></xref> Dependency studies have not been reported for EnvC, but given that it appears to join the septal ring prior to the onset of constriction, it is likely to localize ahead of SufI, AmiC and, perhaps, TolB.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Indeed, it is tempting to speculate that peptidoglycan hydrolysis by EnvC contributes to forming the nascent constrictions that might be important for recruitment of SufI and AmiC to the division site.</p>
      <p>While our results firmly establish that the physiological function of SufI is in cell division, the biochemical function remains to be determined. The structure of SufI, determined here at a resolution of 1.9 Å by X-ray crystallography, confirms that the protein belongs to the multicopper oxidase family. However, it also shows that SufI does not bind copper. Indeed, access to the region of the structure that forms the active site in multicopper oxidases is blocked in SufI by highly conserved residues. Together, these observations suggest that SufI is neither a copper-binding protein nor an enzyme. At present we favor the notion that SufI's role in cell division is to serve as a scaffolding protein that helps to maintain the coherence of the septal ring during constriction.</p>
      <p>The ability of SufI overproduction to rescue a variety of <italic>fts</italic> mutants<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> (S.J.R.A, E.P. and D.S.W., unpublished data) suggests that SufI engages in protein–protein interactions that contribute to the stability of the septal ring. Sequence analysis identified several conserved residues in SufI that were all found to map to the same face of the protein. This suggests that this face may form a binding surface for interactions with other Fts proteins at the septal ring. The osmotic remedial nature of the division defect in <italic>sufI</italic> null mutants could be explained if septal rings are somewhat unstable in the absence of SufI and if unfavorable ionic/osmotic conditions exacerbate that instability. With the insights gained from the structure in combination with the phenotypic assays described here and elsewhere,<xref rid="bib7 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,13</sup></xref> it should be possible to test these ideas by targeted mutagenesis of the conserved surface residues likely to be involved in protein–protein interactions.</p>
      <p>SufI is used extensively as the model substrate in mechanistic studies of the Tat protein translocation pathway. Since the Tat apparatus translocates substrate proteins in the folded state, knowledge of the 3D structure of the substrate is a prerequisite for detailed studies of substrate-transporter interactions in this system. The structure of SufI reported here will allow rational site-specific labelling and engineering of SufI for use in the experimental analysis of Tat mechanism.</p>

        <p>Cultures were grown at 30 °C in LB with 1 mM IPTG to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼ 0.5. Slides for visualizing live cells were prepared by pipetting 40 μl of molten 1% agarose (in water) onto a pre-warmed glass slide with two spacers made of laboratory tape. A second glass slide was placed on top to create a thin agarose pad. Once cooled, the two slides were separated and 5 μl of live culture in growth medium was applied to the agarose pad and covered with a #1 coverslip. Cells were immediately photographed at 100× magnification essentially as previously described.<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref> Typical exposure times for GFP were about 2 s. Digital images were imported to Adobe Photoshop for cropping and making minor adjustments to brightness and contrast. Final figures were assembled in Canvas.</p>
        <p>For assessing the dependency of SufI-GFP on FtsZ, strains were grown in LB with 1 mM IPTG at 30 °C to mid log phase. Then 1 ml of culture was pelleted in a microcentrifuge and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of LB0N. The washed cells were used at a dilution of 1:10 to inoculate 30 °C LB and 37 °C LB0N (both contained 1 mM IPTG). Cells were allowed to grow for 1.5 h, by which time the <italic>ftsZ</italic>(Ts) mutant in LB0N had become filamentous. Aliquots of the cultures were transferred to an agarose pad and photographed as described above.</p>
        <p>For assessing dependency on FtsL, FtsQ and FtsN, the respective depletion strains carrying pDSW932 were grown in LB containing antibiotics, 0.2% <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and 10 μM IPTG. (The arabinose induces expression of the respective <italic>fts</italic> gene, while the IPTG induces expression of the <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> fusion.) Once the cultures reached mid log phase, 1 ml was pelleted in a microcentrifuge and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of LB (for FtsL- and FtsQ-depletion strains) or 1 ml of LB0N (for the FtsN-depletion strain). The washed cells were used at a dilution of 1:50 to inoculate LB or LB0N containing antibiotics, 10 μm IPTG and either 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose. Cultures were grown at 30 or 37 °C for 3–4 h, by which time the cells growing in the presence of glucose had become filamentous. Aliquots of the cultures were transferred to an agarose pad and photographed as described above.</p>
        <p>To verify the periplasmic localization of SufI/GFP fusion proteins (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>), transformants were grown at 30 °C in LB containing Amp and 10 μM IPTG to mid log phase.

Because some of the fusion constructs were not well tolerated in the DADE background, the length of the growth period was different for different strains. GFP, GFP-SufI, SufI-GFP and FtsZ-GFP overnight cultures were diluted 1:1000 and grown for 4 h. GFP-FtsI and GFP-FtsN overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 and grown for 1 h.</p>

(c) GFP/SufI fusions rescue division defects. Derivatives of EC1751 (<italic>sufI&lt;&gt;aph</italic>) expressing the indicated <italic>gfp</italic> construct were grown in LB0N and photographed as above. The strains shown are EC1874, EC1875 and EC1876. The scale bar represents 5 μm. (d) Immunoblot of strains that express <italic>gfp</italic>, <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> or <italic>gfp-sufI</italic> under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. Sample concentrations were normalized by OD<sub>600</sub>, except that fourfold more of the <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> sample was loaded because this fusion gene is not highly expressed. The blot was probed with anti-GFP serum. The strains shown are <italic>gfp</italic> (EC1874), <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> (EC1876) and <italic>gfp-sufI</italic> (EC1875).

        <p>Recruitment of SufI to septal rings requires other Fts proteins. The top two panel sets show a wild-type (WT) strain or <italic>ftsZ</italic>(Ts) mutant grown at 30 °C in LB (permissive) or 37 °C in LB0N (non-permissive). The strains shown are EC1873 and EC2065, both of which carry a chromosomal <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> fusion. Traditionally, 42 °C has been used as the non-permissive temperature for <italic>ftsZ84</italic>(Ts), but we found that SufI-GFP was not fluorescent at 42 °C. The bottom three panel sets show FtsQ, FtsL or FtsN depletion strains. The strains shown are JM265, JOE170 and EC1908 and carry the <italic>sufI-gfp</italic> plasmid pDSW932. These strains produce the indicated Fts protein from an arabinose-dependent promoter and were grown in the presence of arabinose (permissive) or glucose (non-permissive). The cells shown are representative. For quantitative data, see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>.</p>

Residues Gly117, Arg125 and Val127 (blue sticks) form the brim of a surface cavity that exposes the 112–114 loop (DGG in CueO, conserved as DGX across all multicopper oxidases) to the solvent. (b) SufI: in green, the glycine residues Gly114 and Gly115 corresponding to the glycines in (a); in blue, the residues Arg118, Trp126 and Pro128, which are all highly conserved across SufI sequences and prevent solvent access to the 112–114 loop in the SufI structure.
