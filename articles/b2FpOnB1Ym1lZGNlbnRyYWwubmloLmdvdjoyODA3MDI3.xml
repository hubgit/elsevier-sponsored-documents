        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Translational control is widely used to adjust gene expression levels. During the stringent response in bacteria, mRNA is degraded on the ribosome by the ribosome-dependent endonuclease, RelE. The molecular basis for recognition of the ribosome and mRNA by RelE and the mechanism of cleavage are unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> RelE in isolation (2.5 Å) and bound to programmed <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> 70S ribosomes before (3.3 Å) and after (3.6 Å) cleavage. RelE occupies the A site and causes cleavage of mRNA after the second nucleotide of the codon by reorienting and activating the mRNA for 2′-OH-induced hydrolysis. Stacking of A site codon bases with conserved residues in RelE and 16S rRNA explains the requirement for the ribosome in catalysis and the subtle sequence specificity of the reaction. These structures provide detailed insight into the translational regulation on the bacterial ribosome by mRNA cleavage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rapid adaptation to environmental stress is vital for free-living bacteria. During deprivation of nutrients, uncharged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) bind to the ribosome and activate the stringent factor, RelA, which recognizes stalled ribosomes and catalyzes synthesis of the signal nucleotide, (p)ppGpp. This alarmone regulates the <italic>stringent response</italic>, a far-reaching adaptation of the bacterial metabolism to the changing growth conditions (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Potrykus and Cashel, 2008</xref>). The stringent response also leads to activation of RelE, an effective inhibitor of protein synthesis. Under normal physiological conditions, RelE forms a tight complex with another protein, RelB, and is inactive (<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib13 bib17 bib25 bib29 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Gerdes, 2003; Christensen et al., 2001; Galvani et al., 2001; Gotfredsen and Gerdes, 1998; Li et al., 2009; Overgaard et al., 2008; Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). After the controlled degradation of RelB by Lon protease, RelE is able to bind the ribosome and specifically cleave messenger RNA (mRNA) in the A site (<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib13 bib25 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Gerdes, 2003; Christensen et al., 2001; Galvani et al., 2001; Li et al., 2009; Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Such toxin-antitoxin pairs are very common in bacteria, and the RelE superfamily also encompasses HigB, YoeB, YafQ, and YhaV, associated with a variety of cellular response mechanisms (<xref rid="bib5 bib18 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Christensen-Dalsgaard and Gerdes, 2006; Grady and Hayes, 2003; Prysak et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>). The crystal structure of YoeB showed that its fold and catalytic mechanism resembles compact bacterial endonucleases like RNase T1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kamada and Hanaoka, 2005</xref>). RelE is structurally similar to YoeB (<xref rid="bib25 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009; Takagi et al., 2005</xref>) but lacks the conserved catalytic histidine and glutamate residues promoting the idea that it might work by activating an intrinsic nuclease activity of the ribosome (<xref rid="bib15 bib19 bib23 bib25 bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Garza-Sanchez et al., 2008; Hayes and Sauer, 2003; Kamada and Hanaoka, 2005; Li et al., 2009; Sunohara et al., 2004; Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). Although this could explain how pausing ribosomes are recovered for rescue by tmRNA in the absence of stringent response factors (<xref rid="bib19 bib23 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Sauer, 2003; Kamada and Hanaoka, 2005; Sunohara et al., 2004</xref>), recent data suggest that cleavage is most likely a result of the combined action of RelE-like endonucleases and exonucleases like RNase II (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garza-Sanchez et al., 2009</xref>). RelE-induced cleavage most commonly occurs after the second nucleotide of the A site codon, although it is occasionally also seen after the third nucleotide and, upon peptide release, even in the E site (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). The mRNA sequence appears to have a significant effect on the cleavage efficiency, with the UAG and UGA stop codons and sense codons like UCG and CAG, among the most efficiently cleaved (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). Together, the data suggest a subtle preference for pyrimidines in the first position of the codon, and purines in positions two and three (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>To investigate the mechanism of ribosome-dependent mRNA recognition and cleavage by RelE, we have determined the isolated crystal structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RelE at 2.5 Å resolution and structures of RelE bound to <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> 70S ribosomes in complex with mRNA and tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> in the pre- and postcleavage states at 3.3 and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that RelE only undergoes slight conformational changes upon binding the ribosome, where it occupies the A site on the 30S subunit. Binding of RelE significantly reorganizes the mRNA of the A site, leading to 2′-OH-induced hydrolysis between codon positions two and three. The structure suggests a model in which RelE uses conserved basic residues to promote activation of the RNA 2′-OH, stabilize of the transition state, and protonate of the 5′ leaving group of the reaction, and provides a firm basis for understanding both the cleavage mechanism and sequence specificity of RelE and other related ribosome-dependent endonucleases.</p>

        <title>Structure Determination</title>
        <p>Wild-type RelE (RelE<sup>wt</sup>) and an inactive mutant, RelE<sup>R45A/R81A</sup>, were expressed in complex with RelB and isolated by denaturation followed by renaturation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2002</xref>). Intact <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> 70S ribosomes were purified as previously described (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Selmer et al., 2006</xref>) and incubated with RelE, <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, and mRNA, either unmodified or 2′-O-methylated at all three nucleotides of the A site codon, prior to crystallization. Under these conditions, RelE<sup>wt</sup> cleaves the unmodified mRNA inside the ribosome, and complexes representing the uncleaved (2′-O-methyl mRNA + RelE<sup>R45A/R81A</sup>) and cleaved (unmodified mRNA + RelE<sup>wt</sup>) states were subsequently crystallized in space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> with two ribosomes per asymmetric unit (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Selmer et al., 2006</xref>). In this crystal form, the ribosomes contain a noncognate tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> bound to the AAA codon in the E site, tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> bound to the AUG codon in the P site, and UAG in the A site, a stop codon which has previously been shown to elicit efficient cleavage by RelE on the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome in vitro (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>Difference electron density maps calculated after initial refinement of diffraction data extending to 3.3 Å (2′-O-methyl mRNA + RelE<sup>R45A/R81A</sup>) and 3.6 Å (unmodified mRNA + RelE<sup>wt</sup>) using a model containing only ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins allowed modeling of mRNA and RelE in the two states (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online). The final RelE models are complete for residues 2–95 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). All three nucleotides of the A site codon (UAG) and two downstream residues (AA) could be traced in the structure determined with 2′-O-methyl mRNA and RelE<sup>R45A/R81A</sup>, representing a precleavage state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). In the structure determined using RelE<sup>wt</sup> and unmodified mRNA, cleavage has occurred prior to crystallization, and there is weak but consistent density for just positions 1 and 2 of the A site codon, thus representing a postcleavage state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Final refinement of the structures including mRNA and RelE gave crystallographic R/R<sub>free</sub> = 21.9% / 24.7% (precleavage) and R/R<sub>free</sub> = 21.5% / 24.8% (postcleavage).</p>
        <p>To analyze possible conformational changes in RelE upon binding the ribosome, we also determined the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> RelE in its isolated form. Untagged RelE<sup>R81A</sup> was expressed in complex with His-RelB, separated from His-RelB, and purified to homogeneity. The untagged form of RelE crystallized in the monoclinic space group P12<sub>1</sub>1 and diffraction data were collected to 2.5 Å. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of RelE (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and has three molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed using individual B factors with final crystallographic R/R<sub>free</sub> = 22.6% / 26.8%.</p>

        <title>Overall Structures of Isolated and Ribosome-Bound RelE</title>
        <p><italic>E. coli</italic> RelE is an 11.2 kDa protein consisting of a compact, four-stranded antiparallel β sheet flanked by three α helices (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). The crystal structure of isolated RelE is very similar to the structure determined by NMR (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>), but minor differences are observed in the loops and the C-terminal helix, which is absent in archaeal homologs of RelE and appears to be the most flexible part of the structure (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1 and S3</xref>) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). Upon binding the ribosome, RelE maintains its compact conformation, although slight rearrangements are seen where interactions are made to rRNA and mRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). Consequently, the conformation of RelE that arises immediately after degradation of RelB represents the active form of the toxin.</p>
        <p>RelE occupies the A site in near identical conformations in both the pre- and postcleavage structures and blocks access of translation factors and tRNA to the ribosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). With extended, basic residues on both sides of its compact domain, RelE precisely spans the distance and complements the shape of the space between the head and the body of the 30S subunit and makes direct contacts to helices 30–31 and helix 18 (the 530 region) of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Superposition of the structure of A site-bound tRNA shows that the side of RelE facing the P site tRNA very closely mimics the shape of A site tRNA, while the opposite side is wider and closely complements the structure of the 16S rRNA.</p>

        <title>RelE Interacts Tightly with Several Domains of 16S Ribosomal RNA</title>
        <p><italic>E. coli</italic> RelE contains 21 basic residues (out of 95) and thus possesses a large potential for interacting with negatively charged rRNA (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). In both the pre- and postcleavage structures, we observe similar, tight interactions between RelE and 16S rRNA, while contacts to the 50S subunit and ribosomal proteins are almost absent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). A large number of basic residues located on the three helices interact with 16S rRNA. Of these, residues located in α1 and α3 mainly contact the helix 31 region of the head of the 30S subunit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), while those on α2 point in the opposite direction and interact with the 530 region, 16S helix 18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Important interactions involving residues in α1 include K13 that interacts with the O4 of U957 and K17 that contacts the phosphate of U961, all in the helix 31 region (all references to rRNA in this paper correspond to the <italic>E. coli</italic> sequences; Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Interactions between residues in α2 and the body of the 30S include K28 and K29, which contact the 2′-OH and phosphate oxygen atoms of residues G517 and C518 of the 530 loop, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>RelE also interacts tightly with the 30S decoding center via the loop between α2 and β2, causing a significant change in the conformation of the conserved adenosines, A1492 and A1493, known to be directly involved in the decoding of mRNA during translation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ogle et al., 2001</xref>). Using its side chain amino group, K43 contacts the 2′-OH of A1493, while the main chain carbonyl of L44 interacts with a phosphate oxygen atom (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, this KL motif is conserved in many RelE homologs, and mutation of L44 in the archaeal RelE homolog has been shown to significantly reduce activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). As a result of RelE binding, A1492 is pulled fully out of 16S helix 44, while A1493 remains partly extruded and stacks on 23S nucleotide A1913 in the only contact to the 23S rRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). The conformation of A1492/A1493 is distinctly different from that observed in empty ribosomes or when cognate tRNA is bound in the A site (<xref rid="bib28 bib36 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ogle et al., 2001; Selmer et al., 2006; Wimberly et al., 2000</xref>) but reminiscent of the conformation seen in the presence of release factors (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib24 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Laurberg et al., 2008; Weixlbaumer et al., 2008</xref>). The close interaction between RelE and several highly conserved regions of 16S rRNA is consistent with the observation that RelE homologs from archaea are functional in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Gerdes, 2003</xref>) and, conversely, that <italic>E. coli</italic> RelE also is capable of cleaving mRNA on the eukaryotic ribosome (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andreev et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

        <title>RelE Induces a Change in the Conformation of mRNA that Promotes Cleavage</title>
        <p>Recognition of mRNA involves several highly conserved residues on the β sheet of RelE located in a cleft formed between the β sheet and α3. The region is packed with basic side chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, blue), and the most central of these have been shown to be of critical importance for the activity of <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> RelE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, green) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). The overall path of the mRNA through the RelE-bound ribosome deviates significantly from that observed in the tRNA-bound state of the ribosome with shifts, as measured by the distances between identical C1′ atoms of 7.0, 7.6, and 8.3 Å for the three A site nucleotides, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Selmer et al., 2006</xref>). In the precleavage structure, two nucleotides downstream of the A-site codon are visible in the electron density, and their position is consistent with the general path of mRNA through the 30S subunit (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Yusupova et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mRNA path inside the RelE-bound ribosome is longer than usual and likely requires one or more additional nucleotides to be threaded through the entry channel in the 30S subunit.</p>
        <p>When the A site codon interacts with RelE, the bases in positions 2 and 3 are splayed apart as conserved basic side chains interact with the phosphate group between them. This rearrangement is critical as it helps to orient the mRNA optimally for catalysis. The reorientation of the nucleotides is stabilized by stacking of the base at position 2 (A20) with a conserved tyrosine (RelE Y87) and the base at position 3 (G21) with C1054 of 16S rRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>C). C1054 is part of a highly conserved bulge in 16S helix 34, and mutation of this nucleotide seriously affects ribosomal function by causing read-through of nonsense codons (<xref rid="bib26 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murgola et al., 1988; Prescott et al., 1991</xref>). In the postcleavage structure, A20 maintains the stacking interaction with Y87 but has moved slightly back toward the normal mRNA path (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>

        <title>RelE Cleaves the mRNA after the Second Position of the A Site Codon</title>
        <p>Next, we decided to confirm that cleavage occurs at the observed position under the conditions used for crystallization by analyzing RelE-mediated cleavage of the mRNA on the ribosome in vitro. <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> 70S ribosomes were assembled in the same way as for structure determination, but with 5′-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNAs. After incubation in the presence of RelE, resulting RNA fragments were isolated by gel purification and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Spectra collected from the samples incubated in the absence of RelE showed of a peak with mass 8203 Da corresponding to the full-length mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C, blue), while a mass of 6602 Da was observed for samples containing RelE, confirming that cleavage occurs following the second position of the A site codon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C, red).</p>
        <p>We also analyzed the resulting mRNA fragments by denaturing gel electrophoresis by comparison to a reference RNA completely synthesized without A site codon (“Trunc Asite mRNA”) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). Incubation of programmed <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> ribosomes with RelE<sup>wt</sup> consistently resulted in RNA fragments appearing 1 nucleotide longer than the reference RNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 3, 4, and 7), while incubation of the mRNA alone or in the presence of either programmed 70S ribosomes or RelE<sup>wt</sup>, but not both, did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 1, 2, 6, and 15). Although this could be interpreted as cleavage after position 1 of the A site codon, it must be borne in mind that RNAs arising from hydrolysis by internal attack of the 2′-OH on the phosphate contain an additional 3′ phosphate group compared to synthesized RNAs and typically run between ½ and 2 nucleotides faster than their 3′-OH counterparts (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cruz-Reyes et al., 1998</xref>). The combined results are therefore consistent with a model whereby cleavage occurs at position 2 of the A site codon by a mechanism involving the 2′-OH as an internal nucleophile.</p>

        <title>mRNA Cleavage by RelE Follows a Mechanism Involving 2′-OH-Induced Hydrolysis</title>
        <p>To precisely define the involvement of the ribose 2′-OH of mRNA in the cleavage reaction, we repeated the experiments using RNAs modified by 2′-O-methylation at A site codon position 1 (MAO), positions 1 and 2 (MAO2), or all three positions (MAO3), containing a 2′-deoxy ribose at position 1 (MAD), or phosphorothioate linkages after positions 1 and 2 (MAP) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). RelE cleaved both the phosphorothioate-modified RNA (lane 5) as well as mRNAs containing a 2′-O-methyl group (MAO, lane 11) or a 2′-deoxyribose at position 1 of the A site codon (MAD, lane 14) to the same extent as unmodified RNA, showing that the 2′-OH of the first nucleotide of the codon is not directly involved in the reaction. In contrast, 2′-O-methylation of both positions 1 and 2 (MAO2, lane 12) or all three codon positions (MAO3, lane 13) shifted the cleavage position downstream to the first or second unmodified nucleotide, indicating that RelE only cleaves at positions where the 2′-OH is available. Surprisingly, the mutant RelE<sup>R45A/R81A</sup> did cleave mRNA to some extent (data not shown), but not the mRNAs modified by 2′-O-methylation at all three positions even after overnight incubation (lane 18), suggesting that the same conserved basic residues are involved in all the cleavage events observed. This strongly suggests that there is only a single active site in RelE and, consequently, that the mRNA most likely shifts inside the ribosome to allow cleavage in other places than between A site position 2 and 3. Ultimately, it is possible that even cleavage of mRNA in the ribosomal E site is a result of such mRNA frame-shifting (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, our results also demonstrate that R81, which is one of the most conserved amino acids in RelE and is known to be required for efficient inhibition of translation in vivo (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2002</xref>), is not absolutely essential for catalysis, but greatly enhances the reaction rate.</p>
        <p>The involvement of the 2′-OH in the reaction can be confirmed further by close inspection of the mass spectrometry spectra (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). After cleavage, we observe an RNA fragment with a mass of 6602 Da, more closely matching a situation where cleavage occurs after the second position of the A site codon with a 3′-phosphate (6621 Da) than a 3′-OH (6541 Da, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). But most precisely, the measured mass matches that of a cyclic 2′-3′ phosphate (predicted to 6603 Da), which lacks an oxygen atom compared to a 3′-phosphate monoester and can only be generated by internal attack of the 2′-OH. The combined results therefore strongly support a model in which RelE-mediated cleavage of mRNA occurs after position 2 of the A site codon by a 2′-OH-induced hydrolytic mechanism, leading to a 2′-3′ cyclic phosphate at the newly formed 3′ end and a 5′-OH. In addition, and unlike other structurally related nucleases such as RNase T1, RelE does not appear to catalyze the subsequent hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate to 3′-phosphate (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Heinemann and Saenger, 1983</xref>).</p>

        <title>mRNA Cleavage Requires Both RelE and the Ribosome</title>
        <p>RelE is structurally related to a group of sequence-specific, extracellular microbial endoribonucleases that cleave polyribonucleotides independently of the ribosome specifically after guanosine residues, but it lacks their conserved active site residues (<xref rid="bib20 bib25 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Heinemann and Saenger, 1983; Li et al., 2009; Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). Structural alignment of RNase T1 bound to two guanosine molecules representing a postcleavage state (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zegers et al., 1994</xref>) with RelE bound to mRNA, however, reveals a similar position and to some extent orientation of nucleotides 2 and 3 of the A site codon in the precleavage structure to the guanosine residues in RNase T1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A). This observation suggests that RelE nevertheless shares the location of its active site with the microbial RNases and, consequently, that it might recognize RNA by a similar mechanism.</p>
        <p>The reaction mechanism proposed for RNase T1 involves E58 acting as a general base to activate the 2′-OH of guanosine for an S<sub>N</sub>2-type nucleophilic attack on its 3′ phosphate group, H92 (general acid) stabilizing the leaving 5′-OH, and formation of a 2′-3′ cyclic phosphodiester intermediate product (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Heinemann and Saenger, 1983</xref>). In RNase T1, correct orientation of the substrate for inline attack is achieved by “sandwiching” of the guanine base between Y42 and Y45, similar to the stacking of Y87 of RelE with the second base of the A site codon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It can be noted that Y87 is shifted about 14 Å away in the RelE-RelB complex, thus effectively destroying the active site when the antitoxin is bound. In addition, Y87 is the closest functional group to the 2′-OH of the second A site nucleotide in the ribosome-bound structure (3.8 Å), suggesting that it could be important for the catalytic function of RelE. In RNase T1, the downstream nucleotide is held tightly in place by an aromatic stack formed by H92 and F100, but such aromatic residues are absent in RelE and the nucleotide is instead stabilized by stacking with C1054 of 16S rRNA. The structurally related YoeB, which has retained both the active site histidine (H83) and glutamate (E46) and therefore most probably employs the classical cleavage mechanism, has been shown to be able to cleave RNA independently of the ribosome in vitro (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kamada and Hanaoka, 2005</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that it only acts on the ribosome in vivo (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Christensen-Dalsgaard and Gerdes, 2008</xref>), and comparison with RelE reveals that YeoB also lacks the hydrophobic stack required for orientation of the nucleotide downstream of the cleavage point. It may therefore be that it is the combination of a noncanonical active site and lack of the hydrophobic stack that together leads to the strict requirement for the ribosome in the case of RelE. In summary, structural comparison suggests that RelE cleaves mRNA with an active site related to that used by extracellular bacterial endonucleases like RNase T1 and, consequently, that the ribosome is not directly involved in catalysis. However, the involvement of 16S rRNA in orienting the mRNA correctly for the cleavage reaction rationalizes why the ribosome is critical for RelE activity.</p>

        <title>A Mechanism for the Ribosome-Dependent mRNA Cleavage by RelE</title>
        <p>RelE contains no functional equivalents of H92 and E58 that are required for catalysis in RNase T1, but instead depends on a set of conserved basic residues (e.g., K52, R61, and R81) for activity, as shown for the archaeal RelE (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2005</xref>). In ribosome-bound RelE, most of these residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, marked with <sup>∗</sup>) cluster around the scissile phosphate ester bond (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, arrow) and the stack between Y87 and the second base of the A site codon, but their involvement in catalysis has so far been unclear. However, cleavage of RNA by attack of the 2′-OH is a chemically well understood mechanism employed by many ribozymes, and a set of general requirements can be defined (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cochrane and Strobel, 2008</xref>). First, the 2′-OH must be activated by abstraction of the proton by a general base, allowing it to act as a nucleophile and the RNA to orient itself for an inline attack at the phosphate; second, the negatively charged, trigonal bipyramidal transition state must be stabilized; and third, the leaving 5′-OH group should be stabilized through donation of a proton by a general acid. Superposition of RelE with RNase Sa2, another related bacterial endonuclease, reveals that the general base in RNase Sa2, E56 (E58 in RNase T1), aligns with K52 in RelE, while the general acid, H86 (H92 in RNase T1), coincides with R81 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bauerova-Hlinkova et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B). In addition, R61 and K54 in RelE align well with two arginine residues critical for stabilizing the transition state in RNase Sa2, R71 and R67, and are both conserved in many RelE homologs, suggesting that these residues may play a similar role here.</p>
        <p>To clarify the involvement of the individual residues in catalysis, we constructed K52A, K54A, R61A, R81A, Y87A, and Y87F mutants of RelE and measured their cleavage efficiencies on <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> 70S ribosomes in vitro (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Based on our structures, we additionally designed a R81A/Y87F double mutant that we expected to have the strongest effect. Neither the lysine (K52A, K54A) nor the Y87F mutants showed a significant decrease in activity. However, mutation of either of the arginines (R61A, R81A) or the tyrosine (Y87A) significantly lowered the cleavage efficiency. Most remarkably, the R81A/Y87F double mutant almost completely abolished RelE activity. Together, these data indicate that both the arginines and the stacking of Y87 with the mRNA are important for the cleavage reaction and that the loss of the Y87 η-OH group can be compensated only when R81 is retained.</p>
        <p>Both the structural and functional data thus indicate that Y87 and the arginines R61 and R81 are critically involved in catalysis. The lysines, K52 and K54, also have the potential to function in general acid/base catalysis, but our cleavage assay suggests that they are less important. However, they might contribute toward stabilization of the negatively charged transition state by analogy with RNase Sa2. The combined data therefore suggest a model for catalysis in which the mRNA is drawn into the active site by electrostatic forces from several basic side chains, while Y87 and 16S rRNA C1054 orient the substrate correctly for a nucleophilic attack of the 2′-OH of the second nucleotide in the A site on its own 3′-phosphate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). We propose that the high local concentration of positive charges in the active site lowers the pK<sub>a</sub> of Y87 by stabilizing the negatively charged, deprotonated form. Y87 is then able to activate the 2′-OH by acting as a general base, possibly stabilized by hydrogen bonding to a water molecule observed at this location in the precleavage structure (Figures <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>C). The reaction then proceeds toward inversion of the phosphate geometry via a negatively charged, trigonal bipyramidal transition state, most likely stabilized by R61 and possibly K54. A central role for R61 in transition state stabilization is consistent with the strong influence on RelE activity and the function of the corresponding R71 in RNase Sa2 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bauerova-Hlinkova et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, R81 is in position to stabilize the leaving 5′-OH group by donating a proton during the final stage of the cleavage reaction and hence acting as a general acid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). One question that this mechanism raises is why the effect of the single mutations Y87F and R81A is so relatively weak when the combined effect of their mutation effectively abolishes the activity of the enzyme. It is possible that even in the absence of the Y87 OH group, the high concentration of arginine and lysine residues in the active site lowers the pK<sub>a</sub> of the 2′-OH enough to alleviate the requirement for a specific general base. Furthermore, the side chain of Y87 is held in check by hydrogen binding to R81, so it is possible that lack of both the OH group and the R81 side chain leave the tyrosine in a conformation in which it is energetically unfavorable to stack with the critical second base of the codon. In summary, the structural and functional data presented here have allowed us to propose a detailed mechanism for RelE-mediated mRNA cleavage on the ribosome; however, a full understanding of all aspects of the reaction mechanism will probably require additional work by complementary techniques.</p>

        <title>The Sequence Specificity of the Reaction</title>
        <p>RelE cleaves different codons with varying efficiencies, and although there appears to be no consensus sequence, most efficiently cleaved codons seem to follow the pattern Py-Pu-G, where Py is a pyrimidine and Pu a purine (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). In the precleavage structure, the first base of the A site codon is rotated back and contacts the P site tRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). This conformation would be difficult to achieve with a large purine base and could contribute to the subtle preference for pyrimidines at the first position. Likewise, the stacking interactions seen at positions 2 and 3 might be more stable in the presence of the larger purine bases. In the third position, the precleavage structure is consistent with an interaction between the guanine base and the region in RelE around E82, which could confer a more direct specificity toward G. However, none of these interactions seem essential for RelE binding, explaining why most codons are be cleaved with some efficiency, but they may explain some of the observed variations in activity.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In this paper, we present crystal structures of the isolated ribosome-dependent endonuclease, RelE, and its complex with the ribosome in both pre- and postcleavage states. We present evidence that cleavage of mRNA on the ribosome is carried out by RelE and not by the ribosome itself, and we are able to propose a detailed reaction mechanism for RNA cleavage. These results have important implications for our understanding of the roles of RelE and other ribosome-dependent endonucleases in translational regulation.</p>
        <p>The classical description of RelE as a toxin implies that it is a nonspecific inhibitor of translation, most compatible with a role in cell growth stasis or even cell death. However, the effect of RelE induction is more likely a reduction of the global rate of translation during amino acid starvation, leading to increased levels of charged tRNA and increased fidelity of translation (<xref rid="bib9 bib30 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2002; Sorensen, 2001</xref>). This is supported by the observation that deletion of <italic>relBE</italic> and four other toxin-antitoxin loci encoding mRNA cleaving enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic> significantly increases the global translational error rate, consistent with a role of RelE in quality control (K.G., unpublished data). The enzymes have more likely evolved to allow fast adaptation of bacterial cells to changing environments by modulation of the global rate of translation, and the term “toxin” is therefore misleading.</p>
        <p>Ribosome-dependent endonucleases are widespread in free-living bacteria, and many are probably yet to be discovered. But sequence similarity can be very low between members of the family, so many are often only discovered after structural studies. One such example is RegB from bacteriophage T4, which was recently shown to be a member of the RelE superfamily by structural homology (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Odaert et al., 2007</xref>). RegB participates in the life cycle of the phage by favoring the degradation of early mRNA with specific sequences inside the ribosome. It is therefore quite possible that the overwhelming number of RelE-like nucleases in bacteria act as “adaptation enzymes,” each appropriate for a specific environmental situation. Sequence-specific degradation of mRNA by ribosome-associated nucleases might therefore allow the control of translation as response to a range of conditions, including stress response, viral infections, and ribosome stalling.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Cleaved mRNAs</title>
        <p>All mRNAs were 5′ end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP-γ<sup>32</sup>P and complexed formed essentially as described above but only with 3.5 μM mRNA. Reactions contained a 5-fold excess of RelE and were incubated for 10 min at 37°C followed by 30 min at 20°C. For the mutagenesis screen, 2.2 μM of each RelE mutant (0.5-fold) was incubated in triplicate independent reactions with 4.4 μM programmed 70S ribosomes formed in polymix buffer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jelenc and Kurland, 1979</xref>) for 15 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by addition of phenol/chloroform, the RNA extracted and concentrated with ethanol precipitation, and separated by 18% urea denaturing PAGE. Bands were recorded on a phosphor imaging plate, visualized with a Typhoon scanner, and quantified with Image Quant TL (both GE Healthcare). For mass spectrometry, samples were prepared with unlabeled mRNA and incubated with and without RelE<sup>wt</sup>. After gel purification and precipitation, the dried pellets were resuspended in water, desalted, and prepared with ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and analyzed with an Ultraflex III MALDI TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in positive ion, linear mode (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Spottke et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <p>(B) Proposed reaction mechanism for the cleavage of mRNA by RelE with residues from RelE shown in blue, 16S C1054 in green, and the mRNA in purple. Stacking of the second A site base with Y87 and the third base with 16S rRNA nucleotide C1054 (double arrows) first orients the RNA correctly for an inline attack. A high local concentration of positive charge shifts the pK<sub>a</sub> of Y87 to allow it to act as a general base and abstract a proton from the 2′-OH promoting its attack on the phosphate between A site positions 2 and 3. The negatively charged bipyramidal transition state is stabilized by R61, while R81 acts as a general acid to protonate the 5′ OH leaving group, generating a 2′-3′ cyclic phosphate at the new 3′ end.</p>
