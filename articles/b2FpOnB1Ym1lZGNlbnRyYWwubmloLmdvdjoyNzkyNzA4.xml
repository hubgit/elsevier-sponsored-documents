        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The C-type lectin superfamily is highly represented in all metazoan phyla so far studied. Many members of this superfamily are important in innate immune defences against infection, while others serve key developmental and structural roles. Within the superfamily, many proteins contain multiple canonical carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs), together with additional non-lectin domains. In this report, we have studied two gastrointestinal nematode parasites which are widely used in experimental rodent systems, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> and <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>. From cDNA libraries, we have isolated 3 new C-type lectins from these species; all are single-CRD proteins with short additional N-terminal domains. The predicted <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 protein contains 156 aa, <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 191 aa and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2 183 aa; all encode predicted signal peptides, as well as key conserved sequence motifs characteristic of the CTL superfamily. These lectins are most similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic> CLEC-48, 49 and 50, as well as to the lectin domains of mammalian immune system proteins CD23 and CD206. RT-PCR showed that these <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> genes are primarily expressed in the gut-dwelling adult stages, although <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2 transcripts are also prominent in the free-living infective larval (L3) stage. Polyclonal antibodies raised to <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 reacted to both proteins by ELISA, and in Western blot analysis recognised a 15-kDa band in secreted proteins of adult <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> (NES) and a 19-kDa band in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> ES (HES). Anti-CTL-1 antibody also bound strongly to the cuticle of adult <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>. Hence, live parasites release C-type lectins homologous to some key receptors of the mammalian host immune system, raising the possibility that these products interfere in some manner with immunological recognition or effector function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The C-type lectin (CTL) superfamily has emerged as one of the largest and most widely expressed set of proteins among metazoan organisms in general <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. They are characterized by a conserved 115–130 amino acid carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) which includes multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, which determine the calcium (C-type) dependency of ligation. They contain 4 critical cysteine residues which stabilise a two-loop structure, with the key residues involved in sugar binding located on a long flexible loop.</p>
      <p>CTLs may be secreted or transmembrane proteins, and in the latter case they are classed as type II with an intracellular N-terminus. They often comprise multiple domains which confer higher avidity for their ligand. For example, mammalian macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) contains a tandem array of 8 CRDs <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, additional functions are often incorporated through non-CRD domains, such as the collagenous stalk of collectin proteins <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Some members of the gene family have lost lectin activity through evolution—such as the NK receptors Ly49, NKG2, and CD94 NK receptor families, which bind MHC Class I in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner; these homologues tend to have more compact structures with shorter loops <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref><bold>.</bold></p>
      <p>CTLs are perhaps most prominent in the mammalian immune system <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. Well-known examples include the selectins which mediate inflammatory extravasation through binding of leukocyte integrins (CD11/CD18) to E-selectin expressed on activated epithelial cells <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In serum, soluble C-type lectins such as mannose binding protein (MBP) recognise terminal mannose residues found on nonmammalian glycans, and activate the complement cascade. Additionally, CTLs on the surface of immune cells <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> include CD23, the low affinity Fcε receptor <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, CD206 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, Dectin-1, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN (CD209) <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the lattermost mediating endocytosis and breakdown of glycosylated proteins for antigen presentation. In the case of Dectin-1, the CTL contains an intracellular motif allowing it to transduce a cell-activating signal, so that binding of fungal β-glucan can initiate an innate immune response <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Helminth parasites can establish long-term infections in mammalian hosts, attributed to their ability to neutralise host defence mechanisms <xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>. Interestingly, L-SIGN <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, DC-SIGN <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and other CTL family members <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> recognise schistosome egg glycans, indicating that C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) may constitute an ancient pattern recognition system mediating innate interactions between mammals and helminth parasites. The finding that helminths themselves also encode C-type lectin-like genes <xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>, raised the possibility that they may function to interfere with host immunity <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Nevertheless, it is clear that other roles are fulfilled by CTLs within the nematode phylum. Most conspicuously, the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> encodes at the genomic level no fewer than 278 CTL-like proteins <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and several of these have been demonstrated experimentally to be up-regulated and protective in the event of bacterial infection of the worm <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Indeed, it now appears clear that the CTL response to microbial challenge is an ancient and conserved system common to worms and mammals. Most remarkable, perhaps, is the role of a CTL (<italic>Mermaid</italic>) from the marine nematode <italic>Laxus oneistus</italic>, which is expressed on the worm surface and binds symbiotic bacteria necessary for the metabolism of the worm <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Hence, in nematodes as well as in other contexts such as snake venoms <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, CTLs may fulfill not solely a defensive role, but a broader one in regulating interactions with other organisms, be they pathogens, symbionts, prey or hosts.</p>
      <p>Amongst the parasitic nematodes, two of the most widely-studied model systems are <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> and <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>, natural parasites of mice and rats respectively. These parasites have been studied in particular for their ability to drive Th2 immune responsiveness <xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[25–28]</xref>, and to modulate host immunity <xref rid="bib13 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[13,29,30]</xref> through the secretion of immunomodulatory proteins <xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[31–33]</xref>. In this report we identify new C-type lectins from these rodent parasites which, as we show, are preferentially expressed by the mature, gut-dwelling adult stages and form part of the parasite secretions presumed to mediate immunological interactions with the host.</p>

        <p>The gastrointestinal nematode parasite <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> (syn. <italic>Nematospiroides dubius</italic>) was maintained as originally described elsewhere <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Briefly, CF1 mice were infected with 400–600 infective stage larvae by gavage, and maintained in individually-ventilated cages for up to 28 days. Faecal pellets were collected from day 10 onwards, and plated with activated charcoal to provide culture conditions for eggs to hatch and larvae to grow over a 9-day period to the infective larval (L3) stage. Larvae were collected from plates and washed 3 times in water. Larvae were stored for up to 60 days at 4 °C before use. Adult worms were collected 14–28 days post-infection by Baermannization and used immediately for mRNA isolation or in vitro culture for secreted antigens.</p>

        <title><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> cDNA library construction and identification of <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1</title>
        <p>A Uni-ZAP XR cDNA phage library was constructed from approximately 400 µl packed volume of adult worms taken 28 days post-infection. Following RNA extraction in TriZOL and DNase treatment, the poly-A+ mRNA fractions were isolated using an Ambion Micropoly(A) Purist kit. First strand cDNA synthesis was primed from an oligo-d(T) primer with an unmethylated <italic>Xho</italic>I site. Second strand synthesis by DNA polymerase I followed RNase H treatment of the template. Blunt-ended cDNAs were ligated to <italic>EcoR</italic>I adapters, phosphorylated and digested with <italic>Xho</italic>I. cDNAs were then size fractionated over Sepharose and ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector arms. Following phage packaging, XL1-Blue MRF′ cells were infected to determine the library titre of 2.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml on the basis of blue/white selection. Plaques from this primary titration were picked at random, insert sizes determined by PCR with M13F and M13R primers, and sequenced on an ABI9600 capillary DNA sequencer as part of a larger-scale EST analysis (Harcus, Y., Filbey, K., Blaxter, M. and Maizels, R., unpublished). The library was amplified before storage at a titre of 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/ml. One of the first randomly-picked sequences corresponded to a full-length 156-aa open reading frame with significant similarity to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian C-type lectins. The ORF encoding the full-length mature protein (without predicted signal sequence) was amplified for expression of recombinant protein in pET21b in <italic>E. coli</italic> using the following primers : forward primer (<italic>Nde</italic>I site underlined) CGC <underline>CAT ATG</underline> AAT GAA TGT TGG TAT GTG (nt 67-84 of CDS); and reverse primer (<italic>Xho</italic>I site underlined) CCG <underline>CTC GAG</underline> AAT CTT ACA AAC GTA GCC (nt 468-451 of CDS). PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T, sequenced to verify no error had occurred, and plasmid DNA prepared for restriction digestion and insertion into pET21b. The cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank as <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-n:FJ456978" ext-link-type="uri">FJ456978</ext-link>.</p>

        <p>The gastrointestinal nematode parasite <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> was maintained in rats as described elsewhere <xref rid="bib26 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[26,35]</xref>. Infective L3 larvae were collected from plates of charcoal-faecal culture; 4000 L3 were injected into SD rats, and lung-stage L4 collected 48 h later by Baermannisation. Adult parasites were taken 6 days post-infection.</p>

        <p>A <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> Uni-Zap phage library from M. Selkirk (Imperial College London) prepared from day 5 mixed-sex adults as described elsewhere <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and multiple clones sequenced for EST analysis <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Cluster NBC00175 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nematodes.org/nembase3/cluster.php?cluster=NBC00175" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nematodes.org/nembase3/cluster.php?cluster=NBC00175</ext-link>) was found to contain a 480-nt sequence with similarity to C-type lectins, and was designated <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1. Additional ESTs subsequently extended this cluster to 592 nt, but no start site was included. An identical cluster was also assembled as NB01234 at nematode.net. Primers made to isolate 5′ and 3′ ends by PCR with appropriate vector primers from the cDNA library were as follows : for 5′ end, YMH-L-R1 (223-202): GCC CTC CTT TAT CCT GGC AGC G ; for 3′ end, YMH-L-F1 (524-538): ATA TCC GTT GTG ACG CG (numbers relate to nt positions in final, full-length sequence). Because <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 contains an internal <italic>Nde</italic>I site (nt 491-496 of ORF), an alternative expression system was employed. cDNA encoding recombinant <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 protein (aa 21-191) was amplified with primers containing <italic>BamH</italic>I sites (underlined): YH-EXP-F (58-78): <underline>GGA TCC</underline> G ACA TTC AAG GCG ATA GCG CCG; YH-EXP-R (556-576, including stop codon): <underline>GGA TCC</underline> CTA AAC TGC GAC TTC GCA CAC. The amplicon was ligated into pGEM-T, colonies from transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> were picked and sequenced, and the appropriate plasmid preparation was digested with BamHI enzyme. Gel-purified inserts were ligated into pET15b, transformants were colony screened for orientation, and expression was induced as described below. The coding region cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank as <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-n:FJ456979" ext-link-type="uri">FJ456979</ext-link>.</p>

        <title>RT-PCR</title>
        <p>First strand cDNA was prepared from L3, lung L3, gut L4, male and female worms and eggs. In each case, approximately 50 µl of packed parasites were homogenised in 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen), and the aqueous layer recovered after centrifugation was mixed with isopropanol to precipitate RNA. The RNA pellet was washed in ethanol, air-dried, and treated with DNase (Ambion DNA-free kit). Reverse transcription was performed with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions.</p>
        <p>First strand cDNA was then used for conventional PCR using the following primers, and the programme of 5 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min for 28 cycles and 72 °C for 10 min. For <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> CTL-1-specific RT-PCR, the same primers were used as described in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1</xref>, complementary to nt 67-84 and 468-451 of the coding sequence. Species-specific actin primers were used as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Actin 216-237: TGA GCA CGG TAT CGT CAC CAA C</p></list-item><list-item><p>Actin 918-897: TTG AAG GTC TCG AAC ATG ATC TG.</p></list-item></list></p>

        <title>Protein expression</title>
        <p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) bacteria were transformed with recombinant pET15b (<italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1) or pET21 (<italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1); cultures were then induced to express protein in the presence of 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. Pilot experiments had established that the proteins were insoluble in the absence of 8 M urea. Bacteria were therefore recovered by centrifugation and pelleted cells were taken up in binding buffer containing 8 M urea. This suspension was sonicated and the soluble supernatant was recovered following centrifugation.

All three proteins contained a hexa-histidine tag to permit affinity chromatography by nickel-chelating columns.</p>

        <title>Sequences of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> CTL genes</title>
        <p><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> are the two most widely-studied nematode parasites of rodents, and are natural parasites of the intestinal tract of mice and rats respectively. As part of a larger transcriptomic project on these species, we noted clones with significant sequence similarity to the C-type lectin family. From an adult <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> cDNA library, we identified <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 as a full-length transcript encoding a 22-aa predicted signal peptide and a 135-aa single-domain CRD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), with a predicted mature mol.wt. of 17,811 before signal peptide cleavage is taken into account.</p>
        <p>In the case of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, two clusters of ESTs were identified from adult cDNAs, one of which required additional amplification with library vector primers to ascertain the complete sequence. In both cases, full-length sequences were verified from multiple PCR-derived clones from the cDNA library. The two genes, assigned <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 and -2, encode predicted proteins of 191 and 183 aa respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Both contained predicted signal sequences, in the first case of 20 aa, while in the second there was a similar likelihood of signal peptidase cleavage after 20 or 23 aa. The three CTL amino acid sequences were between 38–52% identical to one another. It was also noted that minor sequence variants were present in different clones from the cDNA library of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, indicating some degree of polymorphism at these gene loci; similar minor variation has been noted with CTL sequences from the tissue-dwelling nematode <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. None of the proteins from <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> or <italic>H polygyrus</italic> include potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, which contrasts with the significant <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation (as well as O-glycosylation) of secreted CTLs of <italic>T. canis</italic> <xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Similarities with C-type lectins</title>
        <p>The full-length sequences were first used to search other nematode datasets for further homologues. The closest similarity was found to <italic>C. elegans</italic> CLEC-48 (for <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2) and 50 (<italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), two highly homologous proteins which appear to have recently duplicated in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Interestingly, CLEC-50 is known to be expressed in the worm intestine and to be up-regulated during infection of <italic>C</italic>. elegans with the bacterial pathogen <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, indicating that this gene product acts in the innate immune defence system of the worm.</p>
        <p>Further homologues were then identified in vertebrate databases. Indeed, the two most similar protein sequences in the entire NCBI non-redundant database to <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 were CD206 the macrophage mannose receptor, and CD23, the low affinity Fcε receptor <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and in the latter case the similarity was highest to the homologue from the rat, the natural host species for <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>. For <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1, similarity to CD206 was also found although to a lesser degree than to lectin-like sequences from the snake <italic>Liophis poecilogyrus</italic> and the carp <italic>Cyorinus carpio.</italic> There were also similarities to other invertebrate lectins such as that from the sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>.</p>
        <p>The three dimensional structures of many of the mammalian CTL family members (including CD206) have been resolved, and the role of many key residues determined <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The protein has two loops, stabilised by 2 disulphide bonds between C1–C4 and C2–C3, the latter holding in place a long protruding flexible loop which interacts with calcium and sugar ligands. Each of these cysteine residues is perfectly conserved in the new nematode lectins. Some 26 additional residues are implicated in forming the stable hydrophobic core of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>); some 21 of these are fully conserved in all 3 new sequences described here, including the characteristic WIG (or WIGL) motif (highlighted in red in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that the strongylid proteins share a similar 3-dimensional structure to those known for mammalian CTLs. Importantly, the flexible loop of the newly-identified CTL homologues is of similar length to those of functional mammalian lectins, and not abbreviated as is observed in related proteins such as CD94 which have lost carbohydrate-binding capacity <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The key contact residues between CTLs, two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, and the sugar ligand, have been determined for a number of mammalian lectins. For example an EPN motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is associated with mannose binding, while QPD is linked to galactose specificity; in addition, a glutamic acid residue adjacent to C2, and an Asn–Asp pair close to C3 are also involved. These positions are well conserved in the strongylid lectins, indicating that they may be functional sugar-binding proteins, although confirmation of this awaits experimental investigation with correctly-folded recombinant proteins.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
        <p><italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> are within the same taxonomic superfamily (Trichostrongyloidea) as the sheep nematode <italic>H. contortus,</italic> which is currently the subject of complete genome sequencing. Both EST and genomic <italic>H. contortus</italic> datasets were searched using interfaces at Washington University and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute respectively. The same highly similar homologue was found in both transcriptomic and genomic sets (HC01174), which predicts a 171-aa full-length protein. In addition, more distantly related C-type lectins from a range of other nematode parasite species were noted. Interestingly, the new CTLs aligned with subsets of those in the free-living species <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> as well as the marine nematode <italic>Laxus oneistus</italic> <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> .</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic analysis of existing and newly-identified nematode parasite CTLs, together with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CLEC proteins, showed that within-species similarities are common (indicating recent diversification within each lineage), and also a close relationship between <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>H. contortus</italic> CTLs, supported by bootstrap analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). With the growing number of known nematode CTL sequence, and with better ability to discriminate between true orthologues and paralogues, the phylogeny of this gene family should become increasingly well-resolved.</p>

        <title>Expression is predominantly by the adult stages</title>
        <p>For both <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, the original CTL-encoding ESTs had been isolated from adult worm cDNAs, and expression of a <italic>ctl</italic> gene by the related human hookworm <italic>Necator americanus</italic> has previously been shown to be restricted to the adult stage <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. To investigate expression at different points in the life cycle of these parasites, RT-PCR was employed with cDNA prepared from larval (free-living) and adult (intestinal) stages and eggs, as well as (for <italic>N. brasiliensis)</italic> the intermediate larval forms from the lung of rats. To distinguish <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2 mRNA, gene-specific primers were designed, and in each case products of the PCR reactions were sequenced to verify authenticity of the amplicons. The results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) show that lectin gene expression is primarily restricted to the adult, intestinal-dwelling, stages of both species, although there are differing degrees of expression by immature stages. Thus, both <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 are present only in the adults and eggs, with the latter showing considerably lower levels of transcript. However, <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2 mRNA is present in all stages tested, including the free-living L3 form.</p>
        <p>Because the L3 of <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> is a transmission stage in readiness to penetrate mammalian skin, expression at this point does not preclude a functional role in interacting with the host immune system. In all cases, expression by the gut-dwelling adults also raises the possibility that these gene products fulfill a function in this key interface with the mammalian host. However, an alternative possibility is that gut-dwelling nematodes utilise CTL proteins to counter resident bacterial populations, in a manner analogous to the antibacterial defence functions of homologues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Antibodies to CTLs react with ES proteins and with CTLs from both species</title>
        <p>Recombinant <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 proteins were produced in <italic>E. coli,</italic> but as reported for other nematode CTLs (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) proved to be insoluble in aqueous buffer, indicating mis-folding. Proteins were solubilised in urea and alum-precipitated for immunisation of rats, or added directly to ELISA coating buffer. Rat anti-<italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 antibodies bound the recombinant protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A), but not an unrelated protein (<italic>Bm</italic>-Galectin) produced in the same bacterial expression system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Significantly, anti-<italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 antibodies reacted strongly to the secreted protein fraction of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, HES (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C), although to a lesser degree than anti-HES antiserum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D). However, anti-HES antibodies did not bind to the recombinant protein, which may reflect the fact that the incorrectly folded <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 antigen used in ELISA lacks the conformational epitopes of the native protein. Both native and recombinant proteins, however, would share linear epitopes, allowing antibodies to misfold recombinants to recognise the native antigen.</p>
        <p>Anti-<italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 antibodies were also found to react strongly to the homologous recombinant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) and not to the control protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Reactivity to <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> secretions (NES) was also found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C) although less convincingly than with the equivalent experiment with HES (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). It was also found that antisera to either <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 or <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 cross-reacted with the other lectin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D, E). The two lectins shared 38% aa identity (55/143 positions); hence it is likely that the same antibodies would also recognise <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2 (52% aa identity, 85/163).</p>

        <title>Secretion of C-type lectins by adult parasites</title>
        <p>To identify protein products of the CTL genes, the reactive antisera tested above were used in Western blots of various preparations of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>. Extracts and secretions (HES, NES) were separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE, and blotted proteins probed with anti-CTL serum or normal rat serum (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Strong reactivity was observed to a single 19-kDa band in somatic extracts or secretions (HES) of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>; this size is larger than the predicted mol.wt. of <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 following cleavage of the signal peptide (15.6 kDa), but is within the range accountable by post-translational modifications (such as O-glycosylation) and/or anomalous gel migration. These factors are thought to account for the 32-kDa apparent mol.wt. of <italic>T. canis</italic> CTL-1, which is encoded by a polypeptide with predicted mol.wt. of 21.5 kDa <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. With <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, a 15-kDa NES component was identified, which in this case is smaller than the 19.5 kDa prediction for the unmodified protein.</p>
        <p>An inherent problem with large multi-gene families such as the CTLs, is that closely-related gene products may not be distinguished by antibody binding. Hence, while our data do not unequivocally identify CTL-1/2 as constitutents of HES and NES, it can be concluded that either these or very closely-related proteins are secreted by adult stage of both parasites. Moreover, the RT-PCR data showing selective up-regulation of the CTL-1/2 genes in adult worms, shows that each gene follows an expression pattern consistent with secretion by the adult parasites.</p>

        <title>Localization of C-type lectin to the cuticle of adult <italic>H. polygyrus</italic></title>
        <p>To localize CTL expression within the parasite, adult <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> worms subjected to immunofluorescent staining with polyclonal anti-<italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 rat antiserum. The results, shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, revealed preferential binding to the adult cuticle. A similar finding was reported for <italic>T. canis</italic> CTL-1 (TES-32), which is both secreted by larval parasites of this species, and localized to the cuticle by immuno-electron microscopy <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, it is not known whether, in the case of <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> adult worms, secretion takes place as is thought to occur in <italic>T. canis</italic> larvae. To establish whether <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 was differentially expressed by male and female adult worms, individuals of either gender were tested by immunofluorescence, and showed equal intensity of cuticular staining with anti-CTL-1 antiserum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E, G).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The C-type lectin domain is an ancient and versatile evolutionary unit which is widely expressed throughout the metazoa. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> alone, there are over 270 potential CTL gene products, while the recently-completed genome of the plant-parasitic nematode <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> encodes over 50 homologous genes <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Even within ~ 130 ESTs taken from a single tissue (the intestine of <italic>H. contortus</italic>), 9 CTL-like transcripts were found <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, indicating that many more family members may exist. These proteins may act in many different biological systems, from developmental to structural, and many members of the broader CTL superfamily no longer show sugar binding but have evolved alternative functions on the basis of the same general molecular scaffold <xref rid="bib2 bib40 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[2,40,46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it is already established that within the single Nematode phylum CTL proteins in different environments appear to mediate very different interactions with other organisms. In the free-living <italic>C.elegans</italic>, CTLs such as CLEC-50 are defence proteins against bacterial infection <xref rid="bib22 bib47" ref-type="bibr">[22,47]</xref>, while in the marine Stilbonematodes the Mermaid lectin captures symbiotic bacteria <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The release of CTLs by infective stages of parasitic species has led us to postulate they act in an “offense” capacity, perhaps by interfering with normal lectin–glycan interactions of the host immune system <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This proposition remains conjectural, although some parasite secreted lectins are known to bind host ligands, as in the CTL-4 lectin elaborated by tissue-dwelling <italic>T. canis</italic> larvae <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. An intriguing possibility is that the lectins of gastrointestinal nematodes may interact with the complex mucin oligosaccharides which are known to alter significantly in response to worm infection <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It should also be noted that other parasite lectins appear to play physiological roles within the parasite, for example that from <italic>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic> <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, which is a functional Glc-NAc-binding lectin and most highly expressed in male gonads and sperm, indicating that its function is in worm reproduction.</p>
      <p>Our report now extends the spectrum of known parasite CTL-like proteins, and by demonstrating secretion, suggests that lectin-like activity may be a more general feature of the nematode–host interface. The origin of the secreted lectins remains to be determined, and it will be important to distinguish between products released, for example, in the nematode digestive tract, and those which may be directed for secretion into the host environment. Functional testing of these new gene products, by expression of authentically folded proteins in eukaryotic expression vectors, will ascertain if indeed they are able to interfere with host recognition and/or effector processes.</p>

        <p>Sequence conservation of CTLs from trichostrongyloid nematodes. Sequences of C-type lectins (CTLs) from <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, compared with known sequences from two <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologues (CLEC-48 and CLEC-50), and two mammalian homologues (CD23, and MR or CD206). Accession numbers for <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 and -2 are <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-n:FJ456978" ext-link-type="uri">FJ456978</ext-link>, FJ456979 and FJ456980FJ456979FJ456980 respectively. The <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> CTLs correspond to clusters for <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 designated NBC00175 at Nembase3 and NB01234 at nematode.net; and for <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2, NBC00697 at Nembase 3 and NB00604 at nematode.net databases. The C-terminal domains (aa 175-324) of both CLEC-48 and CLEC-50 are shown, as is also the case for rat CD23 (175-312, <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-p:AAH78749" ext-link-type="uri">AAH78749</ext-link>). The 8th CRD of mouse MR/CD206 (aa 1222-1356, <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-p:ABC87985" ext-link-type="uri">ABC87985</ext-link>) is shown. Predicted signal peptides of <italic>Hp</italic>-CTL-1 and <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-1 and -2 are shown in red letters; for <italic>Nb</italic>-CTL-2, cleavage sites at 20/1 and 23/24 are of similar likelihood, but only the shorter signal peptide is indicated. The characteristic CTL motif WIGL is highlighted in red background. Residues implicated in calcium and sugar binding are shown in green letters or green background. Conserved cysteine residues are in yellow letters and numbered C1-C4. Residues involved in forming the hydrophobic core are labelled according to Zelensky <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, with prefixes indicating structural units (β sheets β1, β2, β3; alpha helices α1, α2; and Long loop region); suffixes indicate individual amino acid, or type of amino acid (ϕ, aromatic; Ω, aliphatic or aromatic; θ, aliphatic; ψ, charged).
