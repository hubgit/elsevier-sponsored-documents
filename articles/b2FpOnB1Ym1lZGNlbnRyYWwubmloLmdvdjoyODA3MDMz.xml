        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Nucleoprotein complexes present challenges to genome stability by acting as potent blocks to replication. One attractive model of how such conflicts are resolved is direct targeting of blocked forks by helicases with the ability to displace the blocking protein-DNA complex. We show that Rep and UvrD each promote movement of <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes blocked by nucleoprotein complexes in vitro, that such an activity is required to clear protein blocks (primarily transcription complexes) in vivo, and that a polarity of translocation opposite that of the replicative helicase is critical for this activity. However, these two helicases are not equivalent. Rep but not UvrD interacts physically and functionally with the replicative helicase. In contrast, UvrD likely provides a general means of protein-DNA complex turnover during replication, repair, and recombination. Rep and UvrD therefore provide two contrasting solutions as to how organisms may promote replication of protein-bound DNA.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many barriers to replication fork progression exist within cells, all of which must be removed or bypassed for the completion of genome duplication. Failure to do so may lead to cell death, but blocked replisomes may also cause potentially catastrophic genome instability associated with cancer and many genetic disorders (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008</xref>). One class of potent blocks to replication are proteins bound to the template (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007</xref>), with such collisions being numerous and unavoidable (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>). Complexes associated with transcription present a particular problem, with direct collisions between replisomes and transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) causing fork pausing in bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref rid="bib2 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et al., 2009; French, 1992</xref>). The importance of resolving these conflicts is supported by the ability of mutations within RNAP to suppress DNA repair defects in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking the Holliday junction resolvase RuvABC (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000</xref>). Suppression by these <italic>rpo<sup>∗</sup></italic> mutations occurs by direct destabilization of RNAP elongation complexes, suggesting that RNAPs may be potent replicative blocks (<xref rid="bib46 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Trautinger et al., 2005; Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). The multiple mechanisms employed in all organisms to restart or displace stalled transcription complexes underline the importance of resolving such conflicts (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rudolph et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recombination enzymes play important roles in processing of blocked replication forks. RecA is required for processing of forks blocked by UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in <italic>E. coli</italic> via a mechanism that requires the RecA loading factors RecFOR, RecJ exonuclease, and RecQ helicase (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Courcelle et al., 2003</xref>). Induction of a nucleoprotein replication fork barrier, <italic>RTS1</italic>, in <italic>S. pombe</italic> also creates a requirement for recombination to maintain cell viability, suggesting that recombination-dependent processing of blocked forks is a general feature of genome duplication (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>). However, recombination provoked by <italic>RTS1</italic>-dependent replication blockage causes gross chromosomal rearrangements (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>). Hyperrecombination near Tus-<italic>ter</italic> and <italic>lac</italic> repressor-operator complexes in <italic>E. coli</italic> also indicates that genome instability is a general feature of recombination-dependent processing of blocked replisomes (<xref rid="bib28 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Louarn et al., 1991; Vilette et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>Alternatively, helicases could displace nucleoprotein complexes ahead of replisomes and so facilitate fork movement without the involvement of recombination, a possibility consistent with the displacement of proteins bound to DNA by many helicases and translocases (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Yancey-Wrona and Matson, 1992</xref>). Bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase promotes movement of T4 replisomes along DNA bound by RNAPs in vitro (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bedinger et al., 1983</xref>), but Dda destabilizes transcription complexes independently of DNA replication (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, Dda may target transcription complexes rather than replication forks. However, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells lacking Rrm3p helicase have elevated pausing and breakage of replication forks at sites corresponding to nonhistone protein-DNA complexes, implicating Rrm3p as an accessory replicative helicase (<xref rid="bib2 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et al., 2009; Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>E. coli</italic> Rep and UvrD are helicases that translocate from 3′ to 5′ along ssDNA (<xref rid="bib32 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Matson, 1986; Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>). Although cells bearing single mutations in <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>uvrD</italic> are viable, <italic>rep uvrD</italic> cells are not (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taucher-Scholtz et al., 1983</xref>), while in cells lacking Rep, forks translocate at half the speed of those in wild-type (WT) cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Denhardt, 1975</xref>). However, slower movement of forks in <italic>rep</italic> cells could reflect the function of Rep along with PriC in the reassembly of replisomes away from <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Heller and Marians, 2005</xref>), although lack of Rep-dependent replisome reloading is not responsible for <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lestini and Michel, 2008</xref>). UvrD, unlike Rep, also has the ability to disassemble RecA nucleoprotein filaments in vitro (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Veaute et al., 2005</xref>), as do <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Srs2 and human RTEL orthologs (<xref rid="bib3 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Barber et al., 2008; Krejci et al., 2003</xref>). UvrD also counters toxic effects of RecQ-dependent recombination intermediates in vivo (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Magner et al., 2007</xref>), while <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality can be suppressed by mutations in <italic>recF</italic>, <italic>O</italic>, <italic>R</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> (<xref rid="bib26 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lestini and Michel, 2008; Petit and Ehrlich, 2002</xref>). UvrD might therefore function to inhibit formation of recombination intermediates at blocked forks (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Magner et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that Rep and UvrD promote movement of replisomes along protein-bound DNA regardless of the identity of the blocking nucleoprotein complex, that transcription complexes present the most significant of such blocks in vivo, and that accessory helicase function must be directed to the template strand opposite to that bound by the primary replicative helicase. Moreover, physical and functional interaction of Rep but not UvrD with the replicative helicase indicates that Rep is a component of the replisome. We conclude that Rep provides a fork-specific motor to facilitate replication of protein-bound template, whereas UvrD, highly abundant in vivo, provides a generalized motor for nucleoprotein complex turnover. Rep and UvrD therefore illustrate two solutions to the direct promotion of replisome movement along protein-bound DNA.</p>

        <title>Rep and UvrD Promote Replication of Protein-Bound DNA In Vitro</title>
        <p>To search for helicases that might promote fork movement through protein-DNA complexes, we analyzed movement of reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes along template DNA bound by a model protein-DNA replication block. EcoRI E111G binds to its recognition sequence but has greatly reduced cleavage activity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 1989</xref>) (see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B, lanes 1–3). Replication of plasmids bearing <italic>oriC</italic> and two or eight EcoRI sites was initiated by addition of DnaA and replisome components followed by cleavage with EagI. Cleavage enabled passage of a single fork through the EcoRI sites to be monitored, since fork progression in the absence of a topoisomerase could occur only after relief of replication-induced positive supercoiling by restriction enzyme cleavage (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Marians et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Ab and 1Ac). In the absence of E111G, replication generated lagging strands of approximately 0.5 kb and leading strands of 4.7 and 1.3 kb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1D, lane 1). Upon addition of E111G, there was a decrease in the amount of the 4.7 kb leading strand, together with the appearance of a 3.2 kb product with a greater inhibitory effect observed for eight as opposed to two EcoRI sites (compare lanes 1 and 2 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). This 3.2 kb product was the size expected if clockwise-moving forks stopped at the E111G complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>Ad). Generation of this 3.2 kb leading strand also required EcoRI sites within the template DNA in addition to E111G, while levels of this truncated leading strand were dependent on E111G concentration (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). EcoRI E111G bound to its cognate DNA-binding site therefore provided a barrier to replisome movement.</p>
        <p>The template bearing eight EcoRI sites was employed to provide an easily detectable signal for screening of <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes that could relieve replisome inhibition. Helicases/translocases were chosen that have been implicated in processing of blocked forks or in displacement of proteins ahead of forks. Addition of Rep or UvrD after replisomes had become blocked resulted in increased levels of the 4.7 kb product, whereas RecG, PriA, and TRCF had no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). The same pattern was observed on the template bearing two rather than eight EcoRI sites, with eight out of ten blocked forks being able to complete replication of the template when Rep or UvrD were present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D–1F). In contrast, RecG, PriA, and TRCF were not able to promote fork movement through this reduced nucleoprotein replicative barrier (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). The relative increases in levels of the 4.7 kb product with Rep and UvrD were greater with two rather than eight EcoRI sites (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1E), demonstrating that the ability of Rep and UvrD to relieve inhibition of replication was dependent on the number of E111G-DNA complexes.</p>
        <p>Thus, Rep and UvrD promoted fork movement through E111G-DNA complexes, whereas RecG, PriA, and TRCF did not. Rep and UvrD both translocate 3′-5′ along ssDNA rather than dsDNA (<xref rid="bib32 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Matson, 1986; Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>), implying that fork movement was not promoted by translocation of Rep or UvrD along dsDNA ahead of the fork. Indeed, neither Rep nor UvrD displaced E111G from linearized, unreplicated DNA, as judged by their inability to relieve E111G-dependent inhibition of DNA cleavage by a catalytically competent EcoRI (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). Promotion of replisome movement along protein-bound DNA by Rep and UvrD therefore did not occur by indirect action along dsDNA remote from the fork. We conclude that the replication fork itself was required to provide ssDNA for Rep/UvrD binding and subsequent translocation.</p>

        <title><italic>rep uvrD</italic> Lethality Is Dependent on Growth Conditions</title>
        <p>We analyzed whether <italic>rep uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taucher-Scholtz et al., 1983</xref>) was linked to promotion of replication through nucleoprotein complexes by Rep and UvrD. The basis of this lethality was probed using a plasmid loss assay employing a very low-copy, highly unstable plasmid bearing <italic>lacIZYA</italic> (pRC7), whose retention or loss in the absence of antibiotic selection can be monitored by blue/white colony color in strains harboring chromosomal Δ<italic>lacIZYA</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt and de Boer, 2004</xref>). Maintenance of pRC7 derivatives expressing <italic>uvrD</italic> or <italic>rep</italic> was studied in <italic>rep<sup>+</sup> uvrD<sup>+</sup></italic>, single-mutant and double-mutant strains. On rich growth medium, pRC7-encoded UvrD could be lost with high frequency in <italic>rep</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>uvrD</italic><sup>+</sup> and in strains bearing single mutations in either gene, but no plasmidless colonies were detected in a Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> strain, as expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Aa–2Ad, top row). In contrast, on minimal medium, plasmidless colonies formed regardless of the presence or absence of <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>uvrD</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Aa–2Ad, bottom row). When plasmidless segregants of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> obtained on minimal agar were cultured in liquid minimal medium and then plated onto Luria-Bertani medium (LB), there was a large decrease in colony-forming ability as compared with Δ<italic>rep</italic> or Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> strains, a viability defect not seen when the same liquid minimal medium cultures were plated onto minimal agar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2D, compare N6577, N6632, and N7120). The original plasmidless colonies obtained upon plating <italic>uvrD<sup>+</sup></italic>/Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> onto minimal agar did not, therefore, contain suppressor mutations that alleviated Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> inviability. We conclude that absence of Rep and UvrD is lethal under rich but not minimal medium growth conditions.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Suppression of <italic>rep uvrD</italic> Rich Medium Lethality</title>
        <p>Plating of plasmidless segregants of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> grown in liquid minimal medium onto LB agar did generate a few large colonies at low dilutions, indicating that effective suppression of rich medium lethality could occur (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, N7120). Nine independent suppressors of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> rich medium lethality were isolated using this approach. These suppressors conferred on Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells plating efficiencies on LB similar to those seen with <italic>rep</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>uvrD</italic><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, compare N7122 with TB28). Reintroduction of pRC7 encoding UvrD into each Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> suppressor strain also revealed that large plasmid-free colonies could now form with high frequency on LB (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Ad with 2Ba; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) (data not shown). Thus, mutations could arise that restored the viability of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells on rich medium.</p>
        <p>Null mutations in <italic>recF</italic>, <italic>O</italic>, <italic>R</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> suppress Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="bib26 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lestini and Michel, 2008; Petit and Ehrlich, 2002</xref>).

However, large plasmidless Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD recF</italic>/<italic>Q</italic>/<italic>J</italic> colonies were obtained at high frequency on minimal agar, as seen with Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD rec</italic><sup>+</sup> (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Bb–2Bd with 2Ad, bottom row). Plasmidless segregants were, as before, grown in liquid minimal medium and then plated onto both minimal and LB agar. Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD recF</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>, and <italic>J</italic> strains formed very small colonies at reduced frequencies on LB agar as compared with the suppressors isolated above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, compare N7121, N7129, and N7559 with TB28 and N7122; data not shown). In contrast, sizes and frequencies of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD recF</italic>/<italic>Q</italic>/<italic>J</italic> colonies on minimal agar were indistinguishable from all other tested strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>
        <p>We conclude that lack of RecF, Q, or J provides very limited suppression of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> rich medium lethality, in contrast to the high-level suppression found in the suppressors isolated in this study. RecFORQJ-dependent formation of RecA nucleoprotein filaments is not, therefore, the primary cause of rich medium lethality in Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells.</p>

        <title><italic>rep uvrD</italic> Cells Are Hypersensitive to Nucleoprotein Barriers to Replication</title>
        <p>We sought to identify the suppressor mutations, isolated above, that restored Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> rich medium viability. These suppressors were WT for <italic>recF</italic>, <italic>recO</italic>, <italic>recR</italic>, <italic>dnaC</italic>, and <italic>ssb</italic>, as shown by DNA sequencing, while cotransduction analyses excluded mutations in the RNAP genes <italic>rpoA</italic> and <italic>rpoC</italic> (data not shown). Inactivation of either <italic>recQ</italic> or <italic>recJ</italic> could also be excluded based on the levels of suppression seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D.

Seven of these suppressors remain unidentified, but two of the suppressed Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> strains contained mutations in <italic>rpoB</italic>, encoding the β subunit of RNAP, as determined by sequencing. N7122 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D) harbored <italic>rpoB</italic>[T3713C], encoding a L1238P mutation, while N7181 bore <italic>rpoB</italic>[C2489T], encoding T830I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Both L1238 and T830 lie near to the DNA-binding channel in RNAP (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vassylyev et al., 2007</xref>). Suppression of the DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and cell division defects in strains lacking the Holliday junction resolvase RuvABC or the dsDNA end-specific helicase/exonuclease RecBCD can be effected by a class of RNAP mutations termed <italic>rpo<sup>∗</sup></italic>, most of which also lie adjacent to the path of DNA through transcribing RNAP (<xref rid="bib33 bib45" ref-type="bibr">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000; Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). Suppression via <italic>rpo<sup>∗</sup></italic> correlates with destabilization of transcription complexes, demonstrating that conflicts between replication and transcription pose major barriers to cell viability (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Trautinger et al., 2005</xref>). We tested, therefore, whether a well-characterized <italic>rpo<sup>∗</sup></italic> mutation shown to destabilize stalled transcription complexes in vitro, <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> encoding H1244Q (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Trautinger et al., 2005</xref>), could suppress the rich medium lethality of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic>. <italic>uvrD</italic><sup>+</sup>/Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> formed large, plasmidless colonies at high frequency on LB, demonstrating that <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> provided very effective suppression of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). A second <italic>rpo<sup>∗</sup></italic> mutation, encoding <italic>rpoB</italic>[G1260D] (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>), provided a similar level of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> suppression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).</p>
        <p>The stringent response regulator ppGpp, like <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic>, destabilizes transcription complexes (<xref rid="bib39 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Trautinger et al., 2005</xref>), while a mutation that increases ppGpp levels 10-fold, <italic>spoT1</italic>, also suppresses DNA repair defects of <italic>ruv</italic> and <italic>recB</italic> strains (<xref rid="bib33 bib45" ref-type="bibr">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2000; Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). <italic>uvrD</italic><sup>+</sup>/Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD spoT1</italic> cells formed large plasmid-free colonies on LB, demonstrating that enhanced ppGpp levels suppressed the viability defects of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Methods of strain construction used in analysis of <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic>, <italic>rpoB[G1260D]</italic>, and <italic>spoT1</italic> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>) demonstrate that suppression is a direct consequence of these mutations. The decrease in transcription complex stabilities in vitro shown by both the <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic>-encoded RNAP and by elevated ppGpp (caused by <italic>spoT1</italic>), together with the strong correlation between this destabilization and suppression of multiple genome stability defects in vivo, have been characterized extensively (<xref rid="bib39 bib46 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Trautinger et al., 2005; Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). Suppression of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality by <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> and <italic>spoT1</italic> indicates, therefore, that suppression may occur directly via destabilization of transcription complexes and that this destabilization reduces the known barriers to replication posed by direct collision between replisomes and transcribing RNAPs (<xref rid="bib2 bib11 bib34 bib40 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et al., 2009; French, 1992; Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007; Rudolph et al., 2007; Trautinger et al., 2005</xref>). However, suppression by <italic>rpo</italic> or <italic>spoT1</italic> mutations could conceivably occur indirectly via mechanisms unrelated to the lowering of replicative barriers posed directly by transcribing RNAPs. RNAP mutations and elevation of ppGpp levels may alter global patterns of transcription, increasing or decreasing levels of specific gene products (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Potrykus and Cashel, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, Rep and/or UvrD could conceivably have uncharacterized roles in the maintenance of transcription, such as removal of protein roadblocks out of the path of transcribing RNAPs rather than out of the path of replisomes.</p>
        <p>A corollary of direct suppression by lowering of transcription complex barriers to replication is that lack of Rep and UvrD reduces the capacity of replisomes to move through protein-DNA complexes, while <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> compensates by reducing the stability of a major class of protein-DNA complexes (transcription complexes) encountered by replisomes. In contrast, suppression by altered patterns of gene expression or by bypass of Rep/UvrD function in transcription would not entail any reduced ability of replisomes to move along protein-bound DNA. We tested, therefore, whether Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> cells had a reduced ability to tolerate nucleoprotein complexes as compared with <italic>rep<sup>+</sup> uvrD<sup>+</sup> rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> cells or cells lacking only one helicase. In other words, could the effects of <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> on Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells be reversed by induction of a stable nucleoprotein replicative barrier?</p>
        <p>Thirty-four chromosomal tandem <italic>lac</italic> repressor-operator complexes provide an inducible replicative barrier that is tolerated in otherwise WT cells and in cells lacking either Rep or UvrD (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>lacO<sub>34</sub></italic> was introduced into <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> strains, and the consequences of repressor expression on colony-forming ability were evaluated in the presence or absence of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Expression of repressor had no detectable effect on viability of <italic>rep</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>uvr<sup>+</sup> rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> or of strains bearing mutations in either helicase gene with or without IPTG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4C). However, the colony-forming ability of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> was reduced dramatically upon repressor expression, a reduction that was alleviated by IPTG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Suppression by <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> was reversed, therefore, by the tandem repressor-operator complexes, demonstrating that cells lacking both Rep and UvrD have a reduced inherent capacity to tolerate stable nucleoprotein complexes. Thus, suppression by <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> does not occur via altered patterns of gene expression, nor by circumvention of direct roles of Rep or UvrD in transcription. Instead, these data strongly support a model in which <italic>rpoB<sup>∗</sup>35</italic> suppresses <italic>Δrep ΔuvrD</italic> lethality by direct reduction of the replicative barriers posed by transcription complexes.</p>
        <p>We conclude that Rep and UvrD promote movement of forks through blocking protein-DNA complexes and that this promotion occurs regardless of the identity of the nucleoprotein complexes, but that in WT cells, transcribing RNAPs provide the most significant type of nucleoprotein barrier encountered by forks.</p>

        <title>Correlation of In Vitro Promotion of Fork Movement with Complementation of <italic>rep uvrD</italic> Lethality</title>
        <p>Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality can be complemented by a Rep/UvrD homolog from <italic>Bacillus</italic>, PcrA (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Petit et al., 1998</xref>). We found that PcrA, like Rep and UvrD, promoted movement of reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes through DNA-E111G complexes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Rep, UvrD, and PcrA are all Superfamily 1 helicases that translocate 3′-5′ along ssDNA to effect duplex unwinding (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>). We tested whether Superfamily 1 helicases that move in the opposite direction along ssDNA also promote replisome movement along protein-bound DNA. However, neither bacteriophage T4 Dda (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jongeneel et al., 1984</xref>) nor <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> RecD2 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Julin, 2004</xref>) could promote movement of <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes through E111G complexes in vitro (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Indeed, addition of RecD2 resulted in decreased production of the full-length 4.7 kb leading strand (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), implying that RecD2 reduced readthrough of replisomes at DNA-E111G complexes. Thus, the ability of helicases to promote fork movement through protein-DNA complexes in vitro correlates with polarity of helicase translocation along ssDNA. This translocation polarity, 3′-5′, is opposite to that of the replicative helicase DnaB.</p>
        <p>The ability of Dda and RecD2 to complement Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality was also tested. <italic>rep</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>uvrD</italic><sup>+</sup> and Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> strains containing plasmids bearing inducible helicase genes were generated on minimal medium and then plated onto rich medium ± arabinose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). As expected, high-level expression of <italic>rep</italic>, <italic>uvrD</italic>, or <italic>pcrA</italic> complemented Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>Db and 5Eb). Complementation of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality was also observed with pBAD<italic>rep</italic> in the absence of arabinose, albeit with reduced colony size, indicating that low-level expression of <italic>rep</italic> but not <italic>uvrD</italic> or <italic>pcrA</italic> could maintain viability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Ea). However, neither <italic>dda</italic> nor <italic>recD2</italic> expression promoted survival of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E).

        <p>Complementation of Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality in vivo was therefore observed only with helicases that also promoted replisome movement along protein-bound DNA in vitro. Moreover, complementation required high-level expression of <italic>uvrD</italic> (and <italic>pcrA</italic>) but not of <italic>rep</italic>.</p>

        <title>Rep Interacts with DnaB Physically and Functionally</title>
        <p>The above data indicate that Rep and UvrD function at forks blocked by nucleoprotein complexes. We therefore screened for interactions between UvrD, Rep, and components of the replisome. No interactions with either UvrD or Rep were detected with primase; SSB; β sliding clamp; the DNA polymerase III αɛ; χψ or γ complexes; or θ, δ, δ′, χ, and γ subunits, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (data not shown). However, Rep did interact with the replicative helicase DnaB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). This interaction was specific. No interaction was detected between UvrD and DnaB, while there was greatly reduced interaction between Rep and <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> DnaB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Moreover, using Rep and UvrD proteins as bait in pull-down experiments from <italic>E. coli</italic> whole-cell extracts, DnaB associated with Rep but not with UvrD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 7). Gel shift analyses indicated that while Rep in the absence of DnaB did not form a stable complex with a forked DNA substrate possessing both 3′ and 5′ ssDNA arms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C, lanes 2–5), a specific DNA complex requiring both Rep and DnaB did form (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C, compare lanes 5, 6, and 10, complex II). In contrast, no detectable UvrD-DnaB-DNA complex was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Thus, a UvrD-DnaB complex could not form either in the absence or the presence of DNA.</p>
        <p>The same forked DNA substrate was used to analyze DNA unwinding by DnaB (a 5′-3′ translocase) in the absence and presence of Rep or UvrD (3′-5′ translocases) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). Enhanced unwinding was detected with DnaB + Rep but not with DnaB + UvrD, relative to levels of unwinding by the individual helicases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F and 6G). High levels of cooperativity were detected at all tested concentrations of Rep, but not of UvrD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H and data not shown). Enhanced unwinding was not, therefore, due simply to a lowering of the processivity barrier for Rep by limited unwinding by DnaB or vice versa, since such a generalized mechanism would have been applicable to UvrD also. Thus, Rep and DnaB interact functionally as well as physically.</p>
        <p>We screened Rep mutants for their ability to interact with DnaB. The autoregulatory Rep 2B subdomain (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brendza et al., 2005</xref>) was not responsible for the Rep-DnaB interaction (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). We next tested Rep lacking the C-terminal 33 residues, RepΔC33. These residues are not conserved in UvrD and are disordered in Rep crystals (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Korolev et al., 1997</xref>). No interaction between RepΔC33 and DnaB was observed, either by pull-down experiments from whole-cell extracts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6) or by SPR (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, DnaB bound to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 33 residues of Rep (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that the Rep C terminus contacts DnaB directly. The affinity of this interaction was high, with the apparent K<sub>D</sub> (equilibrium dissociation constant) of DnaB for Rep and C33<sup>Rep</sup> being less than 100 nM, whereas that for RepΔC33 was 1700 nM (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>RepΔC33 had a greatly reduced ability to promote movement of replisomes through DNA-E111G complexes in vitro (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7B), even though RepΔC33 retained helicase activity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>). Moreover, unlike WT <italic>rep</italic>, a plasmid bearing <italic>repΔC33</italic> failed to complement <italic>Δrep ΔuvrD</italic> rich medium lethality in the absence of high-level expression of the helicase gene (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Da). High-level expression of <italic>repΔC33</italic> did complement to some extent, demonstrating that elevated concentrations of RepΔC33 were needed to compensate for lack of the Rep C terminus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>Db). Thus, the pattern of complementation by <italic>repΔC33</italic> resembled that of <italic>uvrD</italic> rather than WT <italic>rep</italic>. We conclude that interaction between the Rep C terminus and DnaB promotes Rep function in vitro and in vivo.</p>
        <p>Interaction of Rep with DnaB implies that Rep is located at the replication fork. Fluorescent protein fusions to Rep, although complementing Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality, did not form detectable foci in vivo (data not shown) and so could not be used to probe the location of Rep. We therefore employed a second approach to probe the location of Rep. DnaB forms a stoichiometric complex with DnaC, a helicase loader that is essential for binding of DnaB to SSB-coated ssDNA during replisome assembly, but which dissociates from DnaB once DnaB is bound to ssDNA (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wahle et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, DnaB exists as a DnaB<sub>6</sub>.DnaC<sub>6</sub> complex prior to replication initiation but is not bound by DnaC upon binding of DnaB to the chromosome. We tested the effect of DnaC upon the interaction of DnaB with the Rep C terminus and found that the interaction of DnaB with C33<sup>Rep</sup> was severely inhibited in the presence of DnaC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>I and 6J). DnaC alone did not interact with the peptide, demonstrating that this inhibition was not due simply to competition between DnaB and DnaC for binding to the peptide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I). We conclude that interaction of Rep with DnaB is inhibited within the context of a DnaB<sub>6</sub>.DnaC<sub>6</sub> complex and that binding of Rep and DnaB occurs only after loading of DnaB onto the chromosome.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have discovered that cells lacking Rep and UvrD die primarily because of hypersensitivity to nucleoprotein replicative blocks, that this hypersensitivity correlates with the ability of either helicase to resuscitate replisomes blocked by protein-DNA complexes in vitro, and that Rep likely provides this function in WT cells by forming a dual motor complex with the replicative helicase. The requirement for such activities demonstrates a critical need for nonrecombinogenic mechanisms to underpin replication fork movement in protein-rich environments and provides insight into the multiple ways in which such activities may be provided.</p>
      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>Requirement for an Accessory Replicative Helicase In Vivo</title>
        <p>We found that cells lacking both Rep and UvrD were inviable under rapid growth conditions but that this inviability was suppressed by growth on minimal medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Suppression was also achieved by mutations known to destabilize transcription complexes (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>Ba and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), reflecting a general hypersensitivity to the presence of high-affinity nucleoprotein complexes rather than any direct effects on transcription (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Both Rep and UvrD also promoted resumption of replication by forks blocked at protein-DNA complexes in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), while possession of this in vitro activity correlated with the ability of helicases to complement Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates in Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells, although somewhat deleterious, was not the primary cause of inviability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D), consistent with the ability of RuvABC, present in Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> cells, to remove such intermediates in the absence of UvrD (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Magner et al., 2007</xref>). We conclude that, under rapid growth conditions, fork movement along protein-bound template must be underpinned either by Rep or UvrD and that, in the absence of both these helicases, efficient chromosome duplication cannot be effected by the replicative helicase DnaB alone.</p>
        <p>Might accessory replicative helicase activity be essential in all organisms? <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells lacking the probable accessory replicative helicase Rrm3p are viable (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Keil and McWilliams, 1993</xref>), arguing against such a requirement, but our data imply that other helicases might be able to substitute at least partially for Rrm3p in <italic>rrm3</italic> cells. Indeed, while Rrm3p is needed to minimize replisome pausing at many nonhistone protein-DNA complexes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>), it has little impact on pausing within highly transcribed RNAP II genes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). Other helicases might therefore promote fork movement through such genes in the absence of Rrm3p.</p>

        <title>Action of Rep and UvrD at Replication Forks</title>
        <p>Promotion of fork movement by accessory replicative helicases could conceivably occur by direct targeting of forks or by movement of helicases along duplex DNA remote from forks. However, neither Rep nor UvrD possessed the ability to displace EcoRI E111G from unreplicated DNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>), consonant with both helicases being ssDNA translocases (<xref rid="bib32 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Matson, 1986; Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>). Thus, promotion of fork movement by Rep and UvrD occurred via targeting of blocked forks directly. Indeed, replication forks are the only plausible means of providing ssDNA for Rep/UvrD binding and subsequent translocation. The 3′-5′ polarity of Rep and UvrD and the critical contacts made with at least five nucleotides of ssDNA (<xref rid="bib21 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Korolev et al., 1997; Lee and Yang, 2006</xref>) imply that direct targeting of forks requires a minimum of five nucleotides exposed on the leading strand template at the fork, ahead of the leading strand polymerase.</p>
        <p>Polarity of helicase translocation also appears critical in promotion of fork movement. A third helicase with 3′-5′ polarity along ssDNA promoted fork movement in vitro and complemented Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality in vivo, whereas those with 5′-3′ polarity did neither (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, if 3′-5′ helicases translocate along the leading strand template to displace blocking nucleoprotein complexes, translocation along the lagging strand template by 5′-3′ helicases may be restricted. Such a restriction might be due to insufficient ssDNA being available on the lagging strand template for accessory helicase binding due to occlusion of this ssDNA by DnaB. This model implies that the template strand to which the replicative helicase binds might dictate the required polarity for ssDNA-specific helicases to act as accessory replicative helicases. Eukaryotic replicative helicases have a polarity opposite to that of bacterial DnaB (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Forsburg, 2004</xref>). Helicases that promote fork movement might therefore require 5′-3′ translocation along ssDNA in eukaryotes, opposite to that determined for a bacterial system in this study. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rrm3p, the only eukaryotic helicase for which evidence exists of accessory replicative helicase function, is a 5′-3′ helicase that translocates along ssDNA, consistent with our proposal (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title>Why Does the Replicative Helicase Require Backup?</title>
        <p>Why might recruitment of Rep or UvrD succeed in promoting fork movement through a protein-DNA complex when DnaB translocation has failed? Successive loading of helicases, one behind the other, may promote protein displacement (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Byrd and Raney, 2004</xref>). While there is no known mechanism to load additional DnaB hexamers onto a replisome to provide such assistance, probably as a consequence of the need to control replication initiation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>), binding of successive monomers of Rep or UvrD at a blocked fork could facilitate protein displacement. Tight control of replicative helicase loading is a conserved feature of replication systems, suggesting that similar considerations may apply to all organisms.</p>

        <title>Generalized and Fork-Specific Helicases Can Underpin Replication of Protein-Bound DNA</title>
        <p>Rep and UvrD underpinned fork movement along protein-bound DNA in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B–1F), and each helicase provided this function in vivo in the absence of the other enzyme (<xref rid="fig2 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 and 4</xref>). However, low-level expression of Rep, but not UvrD, complemented Δ<italic>rep</italic> Δ<italic>uvrD</italic> lethality (Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D), a property that correlated with the ability of Rep to interact physically and functionally with DnaB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A–6C, 6E–6H, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4, and S5</xref>). Moreover, lack of this interaction abrogated Rep accessory helicase function in vitro and inhibited complementation of <italic>Δrep ΔuvrD</italic> lethality in vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These data indicate that Rep, present in low abundance in vivo (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Kornberg, 1978</xref>), acts as the accessory replicative helicase in WT cells via physical and functional interaction with DnaB. Inhibition of the Rep-DnaB interaction by DnaC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>I and 6J) implies that Rep-DnaB complex formation likely occurs only after the initiation of replication. In contrast, UvrD may function as an accessory helicase only in the absence of Rep by virtue of the high abundance of UvrD (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Janion, 2001</xref>). UvrD might therefore act as a generalized protein displacement motor during DNA replication in addition to nucleotide excision repair and recombination (<xref rid="bib35 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Orren et al., 1992; Veaute et al., 2005</xref>). However, regardless of helicase priority, our data demonstrate that accessory replicative helicase function may be provided by both a fork-specific and a non-fork-specific motor.</p>

        <title>Replication Fork Progression in a Protein-Rich Environment</title>
        <p>Displacement of blocking proteins out of the path of advancing replication forks by an accessory helicase obviates the need for recruitment of recombination enzymes and the attendant risks of genome rearrangements. Minimizing recombination may be critically important, given the frequency with which collisions must occur between replication forks and nucleoprotein complexes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ivessa et al., 2003</xref>), especially transcribing RNAPs (<xref rid="bib2 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Azvolinsky et al., 2009; Trautinger et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, although recombination is important in facilitating replication of template containing DNA damage, excision repair mechanisms ensure that replisome collisions with DNA lesions are infrequent, except when such damage is extensive (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rupp et al., 1971</xref>). Thus, although recombination may be essential for survival in the face of programmed replication fork barriers located ectopically (<xref rid="bib6 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Bidnenko et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 2005</xref>), accessory replicative helicases may act as a first line of defense against “accidental” fork blockage by nucleoprotein complexes. Our data therefore imply that such helicases may be ubiquitous, allowing genome duplication to occur concurrently with other essential DNA metabolic functions, and that within a single organism, multiple helicases may be able to perform such a function.</p>
