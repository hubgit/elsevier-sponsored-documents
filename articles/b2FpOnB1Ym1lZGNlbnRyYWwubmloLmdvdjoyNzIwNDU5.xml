          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in attention, increased motor impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Preliminary work in mice and humans has suggested the X-linked gene <italic>STS</italic> (which encodes the enzyme steroid sulfatase) as a mediator of attentional functioning and as a candidate gene for ADHD.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>The effects of modulating the murine steroid sulfatase axis pharmacologically (through administration of the substrate dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS], 0–40mg/kg, or acute inhibition of the enzyme by COUMATE, 10mg/kg) or genetically (through loss of the gene in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice) were assayed using the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) a test of visuospatial attention and response control, and a locomotor activity paradigm.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>DHEAS administration improved 5-CSRTT performance under attentionally demanding conditions, whereas steroid sulfatase inhibition impaired accuracy under the same conditions. Loss of <italic>Sts</italic> expression constitutively throughout development in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice resulted in deficits in 5-CSRTT performance at short stimulus durations and reduced anticipatory responding. Neither the pharmacologic nor the genetic manipulations affected basic locomotor activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These data provide converging evidence indicating a role for steroid sulfatase in discrete aspects of attentional functioning and are suggestive of a role in motor impulsivity. The findings provide novel insights into the neurobiology of attention and strengthen the notion of <italic>STS</italic> as a candidate gene for the attentional component of ADHD.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in attention, hyperactivity, and increased motor impulsivity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although environmental factors may play a role in precipitating the disorder (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), there is also a strong underlying genetic component (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Diagnosis of ADHD is approximately 4 times more common in males than in females (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and the etiology of the disorder is sex-specific (<xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>); therefore, genes on the sex chromosomes may influence susceptibility.</p>
    <p>Evidence for an X-linked gene influencing attention has come from work in Turner syndrome (TS) subjects. Individuals with TS are females who, most typically, lack a whole X chromosome. They are impaired on neuropsychological and real-life tests of attention (<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>) and are at increased ADHD risk relative to 46,XX subjects (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). We have previously shown that female mice with a single X chromosome (39,XO) also show attentional deficits relative to their 40,XX litter mates (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, we showed that 40,XY*<sup>X</sup> mice (essentially 39,XO mice bearing a small number of extra genes on the Y*<sup>X</sup> chromosome) do not differ from 40,XX mice in terms of their attentional performance, implying that Y*<sup>X</sup> genes can influence attention. We argued that <italic>Sts</italic>, encoding the enzyme steroid sulfatase, represents the best candidate for this “rescue” effect on the basis of its expression pattern and function (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In humans, as in mouse, <italic>STS</italic> escapes X-inactivation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); thus, it may be regarded as a candidate gene for the TS attentional deficits.</p>
    <p>Steroid sulfatase converts various sulfated compounds to their nonsulfated forms, notably the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to DHEA (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); DHEAS and DHEA have important effects on neural function, including cognition (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the mouse brain, <italic>Sts</italic> is most highly expressed in the cortex, hindbrain, and thalamus, with lower expression elsewhere (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Levels peak around the perinatal period and are relatively low thereafter (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In humans, <italic>STS</italic> is expressed in the neocortex (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Steroid sulfatase influences the malignancy of hormone-dependent cancers (probably by enhancing the availability of free steroid precursors). Consequently, substantial effort has been invested in developing specific inhibitors of the enzyme for therapy, for example, the arylsulfamate-based compound COUMATE (<xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">19,20</xref>). In mice, systemic COUMATE administration results in profound attenuation (∼ 70%) of brain steroid sulfatase activity within 24 hours (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>Previous data have implicated <italic>STS</italic> in ADHD risk: males with cytogenetic deletions encompassing the gene (or with inactivating mutations within it) appear to show an enhanced vulnerability to the disorder (<xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">22–25</xref>). However, the pleiotropic effects of multiple gene deletions, the small sample sizes used, and the lack of appropriate control samples means that the conclusions of these studies should be interpreted cautiously. We directly tested the hypothesis that steroid sulfatase could influence ADHD endophenotypes (attention, motor impulsivity, and activity) using mouse models. Two approaches were employed: in a pharmacologic approach, adult mice were given DHEAS or COUMATE to ascertain the effects of acute manipulation of the steroid sulfatase axis. Because ADHD can persist into adulthood with adverse consequences (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), such an approach could shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of adult ADHD. In a parallel genetic approach, 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O male mice (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) were compared with 40,XY males. 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice have a single large sex chromosome comprising the X and Y attached via an end-to-end fusion of their pseudoautosomal regions, with both copies of the <italic>Sts</italic> gene deleted but a normal complement of all other X and Y genes (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Using this model, the effects of loss of steroid sulfatase function throughout development could be determined.</p>
    <p>Attention was assayed using the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) in which subjects must respond as accurately and as rapidly as possible with a directed nose-poke response to the presentation of a light stimulus presented pseudo-randomly in one of five spatial locations to gain a reinforcer. This task also provides an index of motor impulsivity in that it is possible to measure the ability of the subjects to withhold responding in a pause (the “intertrial interval”) before the onset of the stimulus. The neural substrates underlying 5-CSRTT performance have been well specified in rodents (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
    <p>On the basis of our previous findings (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the main prediction at the outset of the experiments was that pharmacologic or genetic manipulations (or both) influencing the steroid sulfatase axis would result in alterations in attention.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.1">
        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>For the pharmacologic study, we used male MF1 mice (Harlan, Bicester, United Kingdom). Behavioral testing commenced at approximately 5 months of age. For the genetic study, 40,XY and 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O male mice on identical genetic backgrounds were imported from Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, United Kingdom. 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice were produced from two separate crosses: 39,X<sup><italic>Paf</italic></sup>O x 40,XY* and 39,X<sup><italic>Paf</italic></sup>O x 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O (see <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">Supplement 1</xref>). Behavioral testing commenced at 4–6 months of age. Mice were treated in accordance with the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (United Kingdom, 1986). For details of animal husbandry, see <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">Supplement 1</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.2">
        <title>Reinforcer Preference, 5-CSRTT Training to Stable Baseline Performance</title>
        <p>Reinforcer preference was carried out as described previously (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), with the main index of preference being the amount of reinforcer (10% condensed milk solution, Nestle, Croydon, United Kingdom) drunk on the final day of preference testing as a percentage of total fluid consumption (choice between water and reinforcer). The 5-CSRTT apparatus, behavioral shaping, trial design, and training are described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) (see also <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">Supplement 1</xref>). At baseline stimulus durations of 1 sec, mice performed more than 50 trials at greater than 80% accuracy (i.e., correct:incorrect responses) and less than 30% omissions (i.e., no response to stimulus presentation); the intertrial interval (ITI) was set to 5 sec.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec1.3">
        <title>5-CSRTT Manipulations</title>
        <p>At stable baseline performance (baseline criteria for ≥ 5 consecutive days), three behavioral manipulations designed to affect different aspects of attentional load/impulse control were performed with 2 or more days of consecutive baseline performance between each manipulation session: 1) short stimulus durations (.25, .5, .75 and 1.0 sec), 2) extra-short stimulus durations (.1, .3, .5, and .7 sec; short stimulus durations increasing attentional load), and 3) long ITI (5, 6, 7, and 8 sec; long ITIs taxing the ability to withhold responding). During manipulation sessions, the various parameters were presented pseudo-randomly. Where relevant, following completion of these manipulation sessions in the 5-CSRTT, the extent to which any effects on behavior could be attributed to attentional processes was further assessed in a 1-choice version of the task (1-CSRTT) in which attentional demands of the task were reduced by only presenting the stimulus in the central response hole (<xref rid="bib12 bib29" ref-type="bibr">12,29</xref>). Stimulus duration manipulations were performed after five or more sessions at criterion on the modified task.</p>

        <title>Behavioural Measures on the 5-CSRTT/1-CSRTT</title>
        <p>The following behavioral measures were recorded: number of trials, accuracy and omissions, (indexing failures of detection and/or motivational/motor deficits) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), number of premature responses (i.e., nose pokes made in the ITI before stimulus presentation, indexing motor impulsivity) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), correct response latency (defined as the time taken to nose poke in the illuminated hole following stimulus onset), and the latency to collect and consume the reinforcer.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.5">
        <title>Pharmacological Analysis in the 5-CSRTT/1-CSRTT</title>
        <p>In the first part of the pharmacologic study, DHEAS (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, United Kingdom) was administered to mice (<italic>n</italic> = 12) at stable baseline performance on the 5-CSRTT 1 hour before behavioral testing. Each mouse received four doses of drug (0, 5, 15, and 40 mg/kg in distilled water intraperitoneal [i.p.]) with at least 72 hours washout between treatments; the order in which the doses were given was pseudo-randomized to negate possible order effects. The drug doses selected have previously been shown to influence behavior in mice (<xref rid="bib21 bib31" ref-type="bibr">21,31</xref>). Subsequently, each mouse was given either vehicle or 40 mg/kg DHEAS (pseudo-randomized) and tested specifically on the 5-CSRTT short-stimulus-duration manipulation; following washout, mice were given the opposite drug/vehicle treatment and retested on the task manipulation. In the second part of the study, mice (<italic>n</italic> = 12) were pseudo-randomly injected either with vehicle (.5% methylcellulose, .9% NaCl in distilled water per os [p.o.]) or with COUMATE (10 mg/kg in the same vehicle p.o., COUMATE made according to [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) 24 hours before behavioral testing on the short-stimulus-duration manipulation in the 5-CSRTT. After at least 72 hours washout, mice were given the opposite drug/vehicle treatment and retested. The effects of COUMATE administration were then tested in the 1-CSRTT under the same conditions.</p>

        <title>Locomotor Activity</title>
        <p>Locomotor activity was measured in dim lighting (5 lux) using cages each fitted with two infrared beams. Mice were allowed to explore freely for a 1-hour session, with the number of individual infrared beam breaks indexing their activity. For the pharmacologic study, mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were run for 6 days (1 session per day) to habituate them to the apparatus and to limit any interactions between drug treatment and reactivity to novelty. They were then treated with either vehicle or COUMATE 24 hours before testing. After washout, the mice were given the opposite treatment and rerun. The 40,XY (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O (<italic>n</italic> = 14) mice were run on 3 consecutive days to ascertain the effects of <italic>Sts</italic> loss on reactivity to a novel environment and basic locomotor activity.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.7">
        <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
        <p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS12. Data were subject to <italic>t</italic> test or repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) if normal, with factors Drug Treatment/Genotype and Task Manipulation/Day or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test (if not normal). <italic>t</italic> tests, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests, and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks tests were used to analyze overall performance in the task. Percentage data (accuracy and omissions) and premature response data were arcsine or square root transformed, respectively, before ANOVA (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). If ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between factors, post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey's honestly significant difference test. Values of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 were regarded as significant. The results were not corrected for multiple testing. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error of the mean.</p>

          <title>39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O Mice Show Increased Omissions Relative to 40,XY Mice Under Attentionally Demanding Conditions; This Group Difference Is Abolished in the 1-CSRTT</title>
          <p>To further tax attention, we compared the performance of 40,XY and 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice on two manipulations in which stimulus durations were attenuated: one with stimulus durations ranging from 1.0 to .25 sec and a second, more attentionally demanding manipulation, with stimulus durations ranging from .7 to .1 s. On the first manipulation, there was no effect of Genotype with respect to the two main indices of attention, accuracy and omissions [<italic>F</italic>(1,19) = .31, ns, and <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = .00, ns, respectively], although there was a trend for 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice to make more omissions than 40,XY mice at the shortest stimulus duration (Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 1.54, ns]. On the second manipulation, this effect on omissions was more pronounced, giving rise to a significant Genotype × Task Manipulation interaction <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 4.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01] and a significant pairwise comparison at the shortest stimulus duration of .1 sec (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Importantly, this effect occurred in the absence of any Genotype effects on markers of motivation including trial number [<italic>t</italic>(19) = −1.07, ns, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A], correct response latency [<italic>F</italic>(1,19) = .43, ns, Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = .45, ns, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D], latency to collect the reinforcer [<italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 1.39, ns, Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 1.38, ns], and latency to consume the reinforcer [<italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 1.46, ns, Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 2.02, ns]. Although accuracy did not differ significantly between genotypes on this latter manipulation [Genotype, <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = .02, ns], there was a trend toward impaired performance in the 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O group at the shortest stimulus duration of .1 s [Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 1.71, ns, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B].</p>
          <p>Baseline performance of 40,XY and 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice in the 1-CSRTT was equivalent and superior to that in the 5-CSRTT (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the 1-CSRTT, there were no stimulus duration-dependent group effects on omissions [Genotype, <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 3.15, ns; Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = .97, ns, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E]. Furthermore, accuracy did not differ significantly between the groups on the 1-CSRTT short-stimulus-duration manipulation [Genotype, <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 1.18, ns; Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = .13, ns]. However, 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice tended to respond correctly more slowly for all values of stimulus duration than 40,XY mice [Genotype, <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 5.66, <italic>p</italic> = .03, Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 1.47, ns]. The only other significant effect of Genotype was in the “long ITI” 5-CSRTT manipulation. As expected, premature responding increased with increased ITI length [Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = 6.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005], but unexpectedly 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice made fewer anticipatory responses than 40,XY mice for all values of ITI [Genotype, <italic>F</italic>(1,19) = 4.39, <italic>p</italic> = .05, Genotype × Task Manipulation, <italic>F</italic>(3,57) = .32, ns, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>] suggesting that the former group display a reduced tendency for impulsive responding.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies have suggested that the enzyme steroid sulfatase, encoded by the X-linked gene <italic>STS</italic>, and a modulator of neuroactive steroid activity (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), may play a role in attention (<xref rid="bib12 bib23" ref-type="bibr">12,23</xref>). We tested this idea using pharmacologic and genetic approaches in mouse models.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that haploinsufficiency for steroid sulfatase could account for attentional deficits in 39,XO mice through limiting the conversion of DHEAS to DHEA (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Hence, we expected that DHEAS administration (which leads to a rise in brain DHEAS and DHEA within 1 hour) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) may act to improve aspects of attention. DHEAS administration did indeed improve 5-CSRTT performance at the shortest stimulus duration. Whether it is DHEAS or one of its downstream metabolites (e.g., DHEA or androstenediol) that causes this effect remains to be clarified, but this finding is consistent with work showing that DHEA augmentation in schizophrenic patients improves sustained attention (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Because methylphenidate treatment has been shown to increase systemic DHEA levels in ADHD subjects (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), we propose that DHEA administration may also improve attentional function in ADHD.</p>
      <p>We further anticipated that inhibition of steroid sulfatase would elicit deficits on the 5-CSRTT that recapitulated those seen in the 39,XO mouse. Like 39,XO mice, COUMATE-treated mice showed specific impairments in accuracy at short stimulus durations on the 5-CSRTT, and, as in 39,XO mice, these drug-induced deficits were rescued in the less attentionally demanding 1-CSRTT. Together these findings suggest that steroid sulfatase influences ongoing attentional processes. Moreover, the data indicate that steroid sulfatase plays a similar role in attention in both male (COUMATE-treated) and female (39,XO) mice.</p>
      <p>The 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice, which lack steroid sulfatase expression throughout development, demonstrated impaired 5-CSRTT performance (significantly increased omissions and a nonsignificant trend toward impaired accuracy at short stimulus durations) relative to 40,XY control mice; these deficits were rescued in the 1-CSRTT. As 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice performed equivalently to 40,XY mice at longer stimulus durations, and because the two groups of mice were equally motivated, these results may again reasonably be interpreted as a specific impairment in attention. These data, together with previous findings in other models, support the conclusion that alterations in steroid sulfatase function can lead to specific changes in performance on the 5-CSRTT and that these changes are likely to reflect attentional effects. Future work may assess the effects of DHEAS and COUMATE administration in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice on 5-CSRTT performance to determine the extent to which the behavioral effects mediated by these compounds are truly Sts-dependent.</p>
      <p>We note the discrepancy between the measures influenced by acute inhibition of steroid sulfatase in COUMATE-treated mice and constitutive loss of the <italic>Sts</italic> gene in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice (effects on accuracy and omissions, respectively). Such a discrepancy may arise because of enzyme inhibition via COUMATE causing acute, and only partial, loss of function, whereas <italic>Sts</italic> deletion causes complete loss of the enzyme throughout development. Interestingly, a similar dissociation between the effects of acute pharmacologic and genetic manipulations of the cholinergic axis on accuracy and omissions has been described previously (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Although both accuracy and omissions may be regarded as indices of attention, the precise relationship between the two measures, and the extent to which they index common psychology and neurobiology in rodents, is unclear.</p>
      <p>We also tested whether steroid sulfatase influences other ADHD endophenotypes. Pharmacologic manipulations of the steroid sulfatase axis had no effect on motor impulsivity (as indexed by the degree of anticipatory responding), whereas constitutive loss of <italic>Sts</italic> in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice resulted in both significantly fewer nose pokes per trial and reduced premature responding. Because ADHD is characterized by increased motor impulsivity and because the incidence of hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD in Turner syndrome is elevated (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), these latter results are surprising. The dissociation between acute drug effects and <italic>Sts</italic> loss may reflect the differential effects of steroid sulfatase on ongoing and developmental processes, respectively. In terms of developmental effects, DHEA is known to influence neurogenesis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The dissociable effects of steroid sulfatase manipulations on attention and impulse control suggest that it would be interesting to perform other assays of response inhibition (e.g., stop-signal or delayed reinforcement paradigms) (<xref rid="bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr">38, 39</xref>). Neither steroid sulfatase inhibition nor <italic>Sts</italic> loss resulted in effects on locomotor activity. These data, in conjunction with previous data showing an absence of effects of 40mg/kg DHEAS on locomotor activity in mice (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), indicate that steroid sulfatase is unlikely to influence neurobiological pathways underpinning activity. ADHD is often comorbid with conduct disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder, which are typified by heightened aggression (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In light of this, and bearing in mind that coadmininstration of COUMATE and DHEAS has previously been shown to increase aggression in mice (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it was interesting to observe that 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice appeared more overtly aggressive than their 40,XY counterparts.</p>
      <p>The neurobiological substrates of the behavioral effects described herein are unknown. <italic>Sts</italic> is expressed predominantly in the thalamus, with lesser expression in the cortex and hindbrain (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Structural or functional changes in one or more of these brain regions, together with their associated circuitry, may underlie the behavioral effects. We have compared the expression of a number of candidate attentional genes in vehicle and COUMATE-treated mouse frontal cortex and thalamus but have failed to find any significant differences between the two groups to date (<xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>In rats, lesions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex produce specific deficits in accuracy that resemble those seen in COUMATE-treated mice (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), whereas lesions of either the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) or the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) produce a pattern of deficits analogous to that observed in 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice (increased omissions and reduced accuracy at short stimulus durations and reduced premature responding). In rodents, the basal forebrain cholinergic complex (which includes the nucleus basalis magnocellularis) projects directly to the cortex and hippocampus and also to the thalamus, whereas the pontine cholinergic system exerts its influence mainly through intralaminar thalamic nuclei, but it also connects to the basal forebrain and provides a minor innervation of the cortex (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Hence, our behavioral findings, in combination with previous data indicating links between steroid sulfatase and neurosteroid action on cholinergic systems (<xref rid="bib45 bib46 bib47 bib48" ref-type="bibr">45–48</xref>), suggest that these manipulations may affect attentional functioning by influencing cholinergic transmission (<xref rid="bib49 bib50" ref-type="bibr">49,50</xref>).</p>
      <p>A modulatory role for the steroid sulfatase axis on attention through γ-aminobutyric acid(GABA)-ergic function is also possible: DHEAS is a known negative allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-gated chloride channels (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and <italic>Sts</italic> expression correlates with the expression of certain GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Infusion of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol into the subthalamic nucleus in rats (a site of <italic>Sts</italic> expression) produces an array of deficits recapitulating those seen in mice with compromised steroid sulfatase function (i.e., reduced accuracy, slowed correct responses, increased omissions and decreased premature responding) (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Although any suggestion of a mechanistic link between neurosteroid and acetylcholinergic/GABAergic effects on attention is speculative, it may be pertinent that cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain exhibit high expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub> α3 subunit (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), the expression of which is reduced in the attentionally impaired 39,XO mouse (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is also noteworthy that 1) α4β2-type nicotinic receptors can control GABAergic transmission in the thalamus (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), 2) the gene encoding the α4 nicotinic receptor subunit is associated with ADHD (<xref rid="bib56 bib57 bib58" ref-type="bibr">56–58</xref>), 3) α7-type nicotinic receptors may be found on GABAergic interneurones (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and 4) α7 nicotinic receptor knockout mice show attention deficits (increased omissions) in the 5-CSRTT (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In vivo microdialysis in COUMATE-treated and 39,X<sup>Y</sup>*O mice, coupled with pharmacologic manipulations of the acetylcholinergic and GABAergic systems, could be used to test the idea that steroid sulfatase dysfunction causes attentional deficits through perturbations in these systems.</p>
      <p>Our data strengthen the case for <italic>STS</italic> as a candidate gene for attentional (dys)function in humans and suggest that it would be worthwhile to investigate association between the gene and ADHD endophenotypes. Recent, as yet unreplicated, work does appear to show an association between <italic>STS</italic> variation and ADHD (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Our data suggest that variation within <italic>STS</italic> may be particularly associated with the inattentive subtype of ADHD and underlying differences in the structure or function of the thalamocortical circuitry.</p>
