          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>The identification of signaling pathways involved in megakaryocytopoiesis is essential for development of novel therapeutics to treat hematological disorders. Following our previous findings that megakaryocytes express functional channel-forming <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, here we aimed to determine the glutamate release capacity in undifferentiated and differentiated megakaryocytes and the role of soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins that are known to be associated with vesicular exocytosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Materials and Methods</title>
          <p>Using the megakaryocytic cell line MEG-01, primary megakaryocytes, and tissue sections of bone marrow, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunolocalization were employed to detect factors required for vesicular glutamate release. Vesicle recycling was monitored by acridine orange and FM1-43 staining and glutamate release activity was assessed by an enzyme-linked fluorimetric assay. Genetically modified MEG-01 cells, with deletion or overexpression of SNARE and vesicular proteins, were also examined for glutamate release activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We demonstrated that megakaryocytes express numerous proteins required for vesicular glutamate release, including core SNARE proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein, soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein−23, and syntaxin, as well as specific glutamate-loading vesicle proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Moreover, active vesicle recycling and differentiation-dependent glutamate release were observed in megakaryocytes. Vesicle-associated membrane protein−deficient MEG-01 cells, which are impaired in vesicle recycling, showed a 30% decrease in released glutamate, whereas overexpression of VGLUT1 exhibited up to a 2.2-fold increase in glutamate release.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>These data show that glutamate release from megakaryocytes occurs in a SNARE-dependent, exocytotic manner and is increased during differentiation, suggesting that manipulation of glutamate signaling could influence megakaryocytopoiesis and, therefore, offer a suitable target for the treatment of thrombosis and other hematological disorders.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Megakaryocytes (MKs) are required for production and release of platelets (thrombopoiesis). In order to maintain normal hemostasis, i.e., adequate numbers of platelets circulating in peripheral blood, the c-Mpl ligand thrombopoietin (TPO) acts as the major hormone controlling megakaryocytopoiesis <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. Numerous additional cytokines, such as stem cell factor, interleukin-1(IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, are also involved <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. However, the exact cell signaling pathways involved in this process are still to be determined. In addition, there are at least four recognized TPO-independent signaling mechanisms that regulate megakaryocytopoiesis: gp130-dependent pathways, Notch, stromal-derived factor/fibroblast growth factor 4, and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate signaling <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Glutamate signaling was once thought to be restricted to the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), where it is involved in aspects of normal brain function, including learning, cognition, and memory <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. However, glutamate signaling networks have been identified in non-neuronal tissues, such as bone, spleen, lung, liver, pancreas, heart, stomach, testis, and intestine <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. We have previously reported that primary human MKs, rat bone marrow MKs, and the MEG-01 megakaryoblastic cell line express functional channel-forming NMDA-type glutamate receptors, and that antagonism of the NMDA receptor by MK-801 inhibited normal MK development and platelet production <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. Glutamate transporters, which are responsible for glutamate uptake, have been identified on platelets <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>, and it has been demonstrated that functional α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid−type glutamate receptors are expressed by platelets and are required for platelet activation <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Together, these findings indicate that glutamate signaling has a fundamental role in MK development as well as platelet production and function. However, the local cellular source of the glutamate agonist and the mechanisms that regulate its release are not known. We hypothesized that MKs were also able to send glutamate signals using exocytotic mechanisms similar to presynaptic neurons.</p>
    <p>Membrane trafficking in presynaptic nerve terminals in the CNS is essential for glutamate secretion and involves biogenesis of specialized vesicles that perform a regulated cycle of fusion, exocytosis, and regeneration <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Exocytosis of neurotransmitter is a complex and highly regulated process involving specific protein−protein interactions. The current model is the soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) receptor (SNARE) hypothesis, which proposes that specific vSNARE proteins on the vesicle membrane recognize and interact with the target protein tSNAREs on the plasma membrane of presynaptic cells <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This membrane protein complex is composed of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) alias synaptobrevin (vSNARE) and the tSNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa). These proteins interact with each other in a structurally conserved parallel four-helix bundle, which brings the vesicle and plasma membranes into close contact so that they are ready to fuse <xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[18–20]</xref>. There are numerous SNARE-interacting proteins that regulate SNARE complex assembly and disassembly. SNARE assembly is triggered by the binding of calcium to a putative calcium sensor, synaptotagmin. This induces the fusion of synaptic vesicles docked at the active zone close to calcium channels. Following membrane fusion, disassembly of the SNARE complex is regulated by two proteins, the ATPase N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and an adapter protein α-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein). SNARE complex formation is also regulated by syntaxin-interacting proteins, such as MUNC-18; guanosine triphosphate−binding protein Rab 3, and Rab 3−binding proteins Rabphilin 3, which are involved in exocytosis via hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate, and vesicular adapter proteins Doc-2 and Mint, which regulate MUNC-18/syntaxin interactions <xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[21–25]</xref>. Specific transporters expressed on the vesicle membrane determine the transmitter cargo that will be packaged, carried, and subsequently released following fusion with the plasma membrane. The vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are markers of presynaptic glutamatergic neurons and were thought to be restricted to the CNS, where they function to load glutamate into recycling intracellular vesicles <xref rid="bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[26–28]</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this study, we demonstrate that MKs express a range of functional SNARE and related proteins required for vesicular glutamate exocytosis confirming glutamatergic signaling activity in MKs, which is further increased after differentiation.</p>

Treatment of MEG-01 with tetanus toxin decreased VAMP protein in MEG-01 cells in the absence and presence of PMA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Transient transfection of MEG-01 cells with tetanus toxin induced a 30% decrease (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in released glutamate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). MEG-01 cells overexpressing the VGLUT1 protein showed a 2.26- and 1.69-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of released glutamate and a 2.29- and 1.69-fold elevation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of intracellular glutamate, respectively, when compared to the respective vector control (pcDNA3.1/V5-His B and pEGFP-N2) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that MKs have the ability to release glutamate in a manner similar to presynaptic neurons in the CNS involving SNARE-dependent exocytosis. Several components of the core exocytotic complex and accessory proteins are the same as those identified in the CNS as mediators for glutamate exocytosis <xref rid="bib17 bib18 bib20 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[17,18,20,37]</xref>. Instead of SNAP-25, which is present in the SNARE complex in neuronal cells, expression of its homologue tSNARE SNAP-23, which is vital for membrane fusion and vesicle docking in non-neuronal tissues <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, has been found in MKs. SNARE complex factors were also identified on the protein level in MKs. Consequently, the detection of SNARE complex factors and accessory proteins not only in cell cultures but also in sections of bone marrow, i.e., in situ, supports our results obtained by using a MK cell line and primary MKs. As one of the core proteins of the SNARE complex, VAMP was detected by Western blotting at approximately 36 kDa in MKs corresponding to its homodimeric form, whereas additionally, a monomeric VAMP band (18 kDa) and a 68-kDa band, according to literature corresponding to VAMP/synaptophysin heterodimers, were identified in the human brain lysate control <xref rid="bib22 bib39" ref-type="bibr">[22,39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in MKs suggests that these vesicular glutamate transporters play a role in MKs similar to that seen in the CNS, where they are required for the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles in glutamate-releasing neurons <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We observed immunolocalization of endogenous VGLUT proteins in both primary MKs and MEG-01 cells, as well as localization of EGFP-tagged VGLUT1 in MEG-01 cells prominently at the plasma membrane consistent with vesicular release activity identified in peripheral specialized zones in neuronal cells <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of VGLUT1 in MEG-01 cells significantly increased the amount of glutamate released. Previous in vitro studies have detected increased glutamate release at synapses of VGLUT1-overexpressing glutamatergic neurons <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and overexpression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> VGLUT in motoneurons in vivo has been reported to augment vesicular glutamate release, with an increase in synaptic vesicle volume and a decrease in the number of released vesicles to maintain normal levels of excitation at the synapses <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These data confirm the specificity of our findings and that glutamate signaling in MKs is at least in part VGLUT-dependent.</p>
      <p>Endocytosis and exocytosis of acidic vesicles in MKs were monitored using the pH-sensitive dye acridine orange, as has been described for acidic neurotransmitter-containing vesicles in synaptosomes <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In neuronal cells, glutamate loading acidifies recycling synaptic vesicles and the simultaneous uptake of acridine orange results in red fluorescence. With exocytosis, this dye is released from synaptosomes, which decreases red fluorescence, while green fluorescence of the dye reports its non−vesicle-associated form. In both MEG-01 cells and hMKs, we identified abundant acidic vesicles in the cytosol with mainly peripheral localization in MEG-01 cells. Moreover, we employed FM1-43, a styrylpyridinium dye, to observe vesicle recycling, as has been shown for synaptosomal recycling in a range of species, including mouse, frog, and rat <xref rid="bib44 bib45 bib46 bib47" ref-type="bibr">[44–47]</xref>. The incorporation of FM1-43 dye into MKs during a 20-minute time course indicates that vesicular endocytosis takes place within MKs. Destaining experiments, i.e., removal of the dye from the culture medium, caused a reduction of fluorescence, which provides evidence for vesicular exocytosis. Taking the results of both acridine orange and FM1-43 staining into account, they provide evidence that acidic neurotransmitter-containing vesicles are present in megakaryocytes and that they are participating in active vesicle recycling, as described for neuronal cells.</p>
      <p>We next determined if megakaryocytes released glutamate in a SNARE-dependent manner similar to neurotransmitter release in synaptosomes <xref rid="bib17 bib18 bib20 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[17,18,20,37]</xref>. Depletion of VAMP, which is mandatory for the formation of the SNARE complex <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, decreased glutamate exocytosis, whereas VGLUT overexpression increased SNARE glutamate release by stimulating the loading of glutamate into intracellular vesicles <xref rid="bib26 bib27 bib28 bib48" ref-type="bibr">[26–28,48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in mature megakaryocytes, which were obtained by differentiation of MEG-01 cells with PMA, VGLUT1 protein was more prominent in the differentiated state and glutamate release was significantly elevated. Recently, Isakari et al. <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> confirmed that treatment of MEG-01 cells with PMA can be used as a model of human megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Their gene expression study also revealed elevated messenger RNA levels for SNAP-23 within 24 hours of differentiation. We observed SNAP-23 expression at the RNA, as well as on the protein level in both undifferentiated and differentiated MEG-01 cells after 72 hours of PMA treatment; however, we could not detect differential expression. This could be due to the different time points examined, but nevertheless confirms the activity of SNARE-associated factors during megakaryocytopoiesis.</p>
      <p>The identification of key regulatory proteins, namely the putative calcium sensor synaptotagmin and Rab3A, in MKs provides evidence for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of vesicular glutamate exocytosis in these cells. Via real-time glutamate-release monitoring, we could demonstrate that MKs released glutamate in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However unlike neuronal cells, MKs are classified as nonexcitable cells and are not believed to express voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref rid="bib50 bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr">[50–52]</xref>. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels enable rapid influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a fast response to an incoming stimulus, leading to neurotransmitter release. During this process, an intracellular linker that associates with synaptic proteins like synaptotagmin provides a tight interaction between presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and the SNARE complex, which is essential for stabilizing neurotransmitter release <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Therefore, even though MKs express Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable NMDA glutamate receptor, our observations suggest that glutamate release mechanisms in MKs are different than those described for neurons; MKs rather seem to spontaneously release glutamate, which is increased during differentiation. This further implies that factors regulating the passive and active exocytosis of glutamate, respectively, play an important role during MK differentiation and should be addressed in future work.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our previous studies have shown that NMDA glutamate receptor signaling within MKs is important for megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production in vitro <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. Here, we provide strong evidence that SNARE-dependent glutamate-release mechanisms, similar to but distinct from those identified in the CNS, are present in MKs. The release of glutamate from MKs provides a cellular source of glutamate within the bone marrow compartment, which can potentially activate their NMDA glutamate receptors in an autocrine fashion controlling megakarocytopoiesis and platelet production. Moreover, we have previously shown that osteoblastic cells also express SNARE-associated and accessory proteins and are able to release glutamate <xref rid="bib32 bib54" ref-type="bibr">[32,54]</xref>. This indicates that the osteoblastic cells provide an additional source of glutamate for the MKs and that both cell types may interact in the bone marrow. Together, these findings suggest that SNARE-dependent glutamate signaling plays a critical role in MK development and platelet production and may represent a route for novel therapeutic approaches to maintain normal hemostasis, for example, by generating anti-thrombotic agents.</p>

        <p>Expression of soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex and accessory genes by megakaryocytes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to determine messenger RNA expression of SNARE complex and accessory proteins in MEG-01 cells (left panel), primary murine megakaryocytes (MKs, middle panel) and primary human MKs (right panel). For MEG-01 cells, expression in the undifferentiated (−phorbol myristate acetate [PMA]), as well as differentiated (+PMA) state is shown. Human fetal forebrain or mouse whole brain was used as a positive control. Negative controls (no reverse transcriptase [RT] and water) were performed in parallel.</p>

        <p>Glutamate release in megakaryocytes. (<bold>A</bold>) After 72 hours of cultivation, an enzyme-linked fluorimetric assay was used to detect glutamate release from MEG-01 cells in the undifferentiated (−phorbol myristate acetate [PMA]) as well as differentiated (+PMA) state and from primary murine and human megakaryocytes (MKs) (n = 3, mean + standard deviation; <sup>∗∗∗</sup><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). (<bold>B</bold>) Western blot analysis (evaluated by densitometry normalized to the housekeeping protein glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) demonstrated that treatment with 100 nM tetanus toxin decreased vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) protein levels in MEG-01 cells in the undifferentiated (−PMA; 45% decrease compared to undifferentiated control) as well as differentiated (+PMA; 94% decrease compared to differentiated control) state, which inhibits formation of the SNARE complex. (<bold>C</bold>) Using the enzyme-linked fluorimetric assay with MEG-01 cells overexpressing the tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) demonstrated a 30% reduced glutamate release as a result of the inhibition of the SNARE complex due to reduction of VAMP compared to empty vector control (pcDNA3.1/V5-His B; n = 3, mean + standard deviation; <sup>∗∗∗</sup><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). (<bold>D</bold>) Two different transfection vectors (pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS B and pEGFP-N2) were used to introduce VGLUT1 overexpression into MEG-01 cells. Glutamate released from VGLUT-overexpressing cells, as well as intracellular glutamate was detected by an enzyme-linked fluorimetric assay. Compared to empty vector controls (pcDNA3.1/V5-His B and pEGFP-N2, respectively), glutamate release was 2.26- and 1.69-fold increased and intracellular glutamate was 2.29- and 1.69-fold elevated in pcDNA3.1/V-His B hVGLUT1- and pEGFP-N2 VGLUT1-transfected cells, respectively (n = 3, mean + SD; <sup>∗∗∗</sup><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
