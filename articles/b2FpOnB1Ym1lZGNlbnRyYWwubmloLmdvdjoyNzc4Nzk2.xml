          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Our previous studies showed that the direct injection of an adenovirus construct expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) into experimental venous thrombi significantly reduces thrombus weight. The systemic use of adenovirus vectors is limited by inherent hepatic tropism and inflammatory response. As macrophages are recruited into venous thrombi, it is reasonable to speculate that these cells could be used to target the adenovirus uPA (ad-uPA) gene construct to the thrombus. The aims of this study were to determine whether macrophages transduced with ad-uPA have increased fibrinolytic activity and whether systemic injection of transduced cells could be used to target uPA expression to the thrombus and reduce its size.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>The effect of up-regulating uPA was examined in an immortalized macrophage cell line (MM6) and macrophages differentiated from human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HBMMs). Cells were infected with ad-uPA or blank control virus (ad-blank). Fibrinolytic mediator expression, cell viability, and cytokine expression were measured by activity assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Monocyte migration was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. A model of venous thrombosis was developed and characterized in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This model was used to study whether systemically administered macrophages over-expressing uPA reduced thrombus size. Uptake of HBMMs into the thrombus induced in these mice was confirmed by a combination of PKH2-labeled cell tracking and colocalization with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) by immunohistology.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Compared with ad-blank, treated HBMMs transduction with ad-uPA increased uPA production by &gt;1000-fold (<italic>P</italic> = .003), uPA activity by 150-fold (<italic>P</italic> = .0001), and soluble uPA receptor (uPAR) by almost twofold (<italic>P</italic> = .043). Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and PAI-2 was decreased by about twofold (<italic>P</italic> = .011) and threefold (<italic>P</italic> = .005), respectively. Up-regulation of uPA had no effect on cell viability or inflammatory cytokine production compared with ad-blank or untreated cells. Ad-uPA transduction increased the migration rate of HBMMs (about 20%, <italic>P</italic> = .03) and MM6 cells (&gt;twofold, <italic>P</italic> = .005) compared with ad-blank treated controls. Human macrophage recruitment into the mouse thrombus was confirmed by the colocalization of HLA with the PKH2-marked cells. Systemic injection of uPA-up-regulated HBMMs reduced thrombus weight by approximately 20% compared with ad-blank (<italic>P</italic> = .038) or sham-treated controls (<italic>P</italic> = .0028).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Transduction of HBBM with ad-uPA increases their fibrinolytic activity. Systemic administration of uPA up-regulated HBBMs reduced thrombus size in an experimental model of venous thrombosis. Alternative methods of delivering fibrinolytic agents are worth exploring.</p>

        <title>Clinical Relevance</title>
        <p>The use of thrombolysis in the treatment of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis is not suitable for all patients. Our previous studies have shown that direct injection of an adenovirus construct expressing urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) into experimental venous thrombi significantly reduced thrombus weight. The systemic use of adenovirus vectors is, however, limited by both their inherent hepatic tropism, which precludes targeted delivery to disease sites, and by the associated host inflammatory response. As macrophages are recruited into venous thrombi, these cells could be used to target uPA gene constructs to the thrombus after systemic administration.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The changes that lead to post-thrombotic syndrome are caused by a combination of valvular damage and persistent venous outflow restriction. Rapid recanalization of veins preserves valve integrity and is associated with a lower incidence of reflux.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Patients with shorter recanalization times have an improved clinical outcome.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> It is therefore reasonable to expect that enhancing thrombus resolution may reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic complications.</p>
    <p>Venous thrombosis is usually treated by anticoagulation, which reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism, prevents thrombus propagation, and allows slow natural resolution.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Anticoagulants do not, however, promote natural resolution and can cause bleeding complications. Thrombolytic agents and thrombectomy remove thrombus rapidly in some patients who are treated early but their use is limited.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Novel strategies that replace or augment anticoagulation and hasten thrombus resolution without the risk of hemorrhage are therefore attractive. Natural thrombus resolution is regulated by an inflammatory response involving the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, followed by endothelial cells and myofibroblasts, leading to thrombus organization, contraction, and recanalization of the vein lumen.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
    <p>There is a progressive increase in plasminogen activator (PA) activity within the thrombus as organization proceeds that appears to be associated with the influx of monocytes<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> that are recruited into the thrombus in a temporal pattern.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The fibrinolytic system is an important mediator of cell migration and tissue remodelling.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Net fibrinolytic activity is the product of the relative abundance of PAs and their inhibitors, PAI-1 and PAI-2.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
    <p>Deletion of the gene encoding the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) prevents thrombus resolution, and this is associated with a marked reduction in monocyte ingress into the thrombus.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> These findings have led to the hypothesis that monocyte recruitment, regulated through the expression of uPA, is an essential mechanism in thrombus resolution.</p>
    <p>Direct injection of an adenovirus construct expressing uPA (ad-uPA) into experimental venous thrombi significantly reduces thrombus weight.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The systemic use of adenovirus vectors, however, is limited by their inherent hepatic tropism, which precludes targeted delivery to alternative organs or disease sites, and by the host inflammatory response.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> As monocytes are recruited into venous thrombi, it would be reasonable to speculate that these cells could be used to target the ad-uPA gene construct to the thrombus after systemic administration. The aims of this study were therefore to determine whether monocytes transduced with ad-uPA have increased fibrinolytic activity and whether systemic injection of transduced cells could be used to target uPA expression to the thrombus and reduce its size.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that adenovirus-mediated up-regulation of uPA in monocytic cells reduces the weight of experimentally induced venous thrombi. Transduction of HBMMs with ad-uPA resulted in &gt;150-fold increase in uPA-mediated fibrinolytic activity compared with ad-blank–transfected cells, without affecting their viability or inflammatory responses in vitro. The increased uPA activity was observed 4 days after transduction in vitro. We have previously shown that direct injection of the construct used in this study results in increased uPA activity in the thrombus for at least 7 days,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> while others have reported that this construct expresses active uPA for at least 14 days in vivo.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The increased fibrinolytic activity of ad-uPA up-regulated HBMMs was also associated with a modest but significant rise in the expression of uPAR and a reduction in PAI-1 and PAI-2 protein levels. The higher levels of soluble uPAR produced by the cells treated with ad-uPA may have reflected the cleavage of uPAR at the cell surface by the increased amounts of uPA expressed. Urokinase mediates the cleavage of uPAR as part of a negative feedback mechanism to regulate activation of plasminogen on the surface of monocytic cells.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The reduced levels of PAI-1 and PAI-2 cannot be explained by the inability of the ELISAs to discriminate between PAI:uPA complexes, because there was no difference in the ELISA signal generated after the addition of excess PAI to a standard amount of uPA compared with uPA alone (data not shown). The reduced expression of both PAI-1 and PAI-2 after transduction with the ad-uPA construct may have been the result of their internalization by endocytosis after inhibition of uPA:uPAR complexes by either of these PAIs.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Levels of the uPAR would be less affected by this process as it is subsequently recycled to the cell surface.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Treatment of isolated HBMMs with ad-uPA did not appear to induce an inflammatory response. This finding is similar to that obtained after ad-tPA transduction of human mononuclear cell isolates<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> but contrasts with studies on the effect of general adenoviral infection on mononuclear cell responses.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> It is difficult, however, to compare these studies because there are a number of differences in the methods used, including different isolation procedures and cell pre-treatments that may affect the expression of inflammatory mediators by macrophages. Some of the cytokines assessed in this study could not be measured because they fell below the sensitivity of their respective assays. It is possible that there were minor differences between treatments that we could not detect. No difference was found between ad-uPA, ad-blank, or uninfected cells in the levels of inflammatory cytokines that were measurable.</p>
      <p>The model of venous thrombosis in the SCID mouse was based on our previous mouse models.<xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,11</sup></xref> Thrombus formation was highly reproducible, whereas the pattern of resolution was similar to that seen in wild-type controls, suggesting that lymphocytes do not participate in thrombus organization. The absence of lymphocytes did not appear to affect the number and distribution of other leukocytes found within the resolving thrombi. Neutrophils, which are the most common type of inflammatory cells found in the thrombus at an early stage after its formation,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> were present in similar numbers in the SCID mice and their wild-type controls. Neutrophils have both fibrinolytic<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and antifibrinolytic activity<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> that appears to regulate thrombus size.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
      <p>A similar temporal and spatial distribution of monocyte recruitment and revascularization was also seen in the thrombi produced in SCID mice compared with their wild-type controls. The model allowed us to use human monocytes, which are more easily isolated, in larger numbers and with greater purity than rodent monocytes. This negated the use of large numbers of donor animals.</p>
      <p>Because the binding of uPA to its receptor is species specific, it was necessary to transduce the HBMMs with the human uPA gene.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A weakness in this approach is that although human uPA can activate mouse plasminogen, it does this with less efficiency than human plasminogen (data not shown). The use of murine cells up-regulated with murine uPA was, however, precluded because the isolation of pure populations of these cells in sufficient numbers was not possible. It is conceivable, however, that a larger effect on thrombus size might have been achieved if murine macrophages upregulated for murine uPA had been used.</p>
      <p>We have previously demonstrated that direct injection of macrophages into the thrombus significantly reduces thrombus size.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> These cells may stimulate resolution by expressing a variety of enzymes, growth, and chemotactic factors that stimulate organization and recanalization.<xref rid="bib7 bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,32</sup></xref> Our previous work has shown that systemically injected rodent mononuclear cells are recruited into resolving thrombus.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This study provides evidence that systemically injected human monocytes (HBMMs) are also recruited into the thrombus and that up-regulating uPA expression in these cells results in enhanced resolution. There are several plausible explanations for this effect:</p>
      <p>First, uPA accelerated monocyte migration and delivered fibrinolytically active monocytes much earlier to the thrombus. The in vitro studies showed a faster migration rate for both HBMMs and MM6 cells transfected with ad-uPA, confirming the work of others.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Urokinase has a well-documented action on surface proteolysis, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and migration and these effects have been noted both in vitro and in vivo.<xref rid="bib10 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,33,34</sup></xref> Mice lacking the uPA gene fail to recruit cells (monocytes in particular) into the thrombus.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Urokinase-dependent conformational change in uPAR mediates cytoskeletal changes, activation of kinases, and directional cell migration.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Urokinase also generates plasmin by cleaving the proenzyme plasminogen. Plasmin is not only fibrinolytic but also activates other proteases that are crucial for cell migration in tissues.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Reliable quantification of the numbers of HBMMs recruited was, however, difficult because of the background fluorescence associated with this label. Attempts at quantifying HBMM numbers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were not successful. Better methods of tracking injected monocytes using reporter gene technology in combination with imaging methods such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) or micro-PET would allow a sensitive, noninvasive (longitudinal), quantitative tracking of injected ad-uPA-transduced monocyte recruitment during resolution.</p>
      <p>Secondly, these cells may have promoted resolution by enhanced fibrinolysis mediated by the extra uPA generated within the thrombus. This is in keeping with our previous work showing that the induction of picogram quantities of uPA activity within the thrombus (generated from direct ad-uPA injection) is sufficient to increase the resolution of the thrombus.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Thirdly, it is also possible that ad-uPA-transduced monocytes accelerated resolution through other mechanisms that could include increasing endogenous monocyte influx by releasing chemotactic cytokines at an early stage in resolution.</p>
      <p>The development of methods capable of quantitatively tracking both endogenous and exogenously administered monocytes would help to define how these cells exert their effect on thrombus resolution.</p>
      <p>Altered macrophages have been used therapeutically in humans for the treatment of malignant disease<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and might also be used as gene delivery vehicles because they have a natural tendency to migrate to the site of disease, such as the thrombus. Using cells that have been altered by ex vivo manipulation may obviate some of the problems of administering virus alone, including rapid loss to the liver and lack of penetration into tissue.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Targeting transduction to circulating monocytes may also be possible by coating the viral particles with sugars that bind to specific receptors on these cells.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> This would prevent loss of the adenovirus to the liver after systemic administration.</p>
      <p>One study suggested that up-regulation of macrophage uPA might enhance atherogenesis,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> but that study was done in animals whose macrophages constitutively over-expressed uPA. The method of uPA up-regulation used in this study is transient (approximately 15 days) and is therefore unlikely to cause long-term problems.</p>
      <p>Further studies are required to determine whether:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1</label><p>the time of delivery of the fibrinolytically overactive macrophages to the thrombus is important;</p></list-item><list-item><label>2</label><p>injected monocytes enhance resolution directly or indirectly by promoting endogenous monocyte recruitment;</p></list-item><list-item><label>3</label><p>the effect of concomitantly up-regulating other factors, known to increase uPA activity, such as its substrate plasminogen could enhance their ability to resolve thrombus;</p></list-item><list-item><label>4</label><p>the use of more powerful viral promoters that generate higher and more sustained levels of uPA production have greater efficacy; and</p></list-item><list-item><label>5</label><p>it is possible to reduce loss of injected cells to other tissue sinks.</p></list-item></list></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study provides evidence that up-regulating monocyte uPA enhances thrombus resolution. Our previous studies have shown that thrombus resolution can be enhanced through the direct injection of monocytes<xref rid="bib7 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,31</sup></xref> or adenovirus constructs over-expressing uPA<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> or vascular endothelial growth factor.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Increasing the circulating concentrations of monocyte chemotaxins and angiogenic agents may be counterproductive because they could reduce recruitment of monocytes and other cells important in thrombus organization by overwhelming chemotactic gradients. Monocytes could act as vectors that allow more specific targeting of the thrombus. The proteins that are up-regulated and the means by which this is achieved would obviously require refinement.</p>
      <p>There is also increasing evidence to suggest that macrophages display phenotypic heterogeneity, with at least two subtypes that are associated with either proinflammatory activity (M1-type macrophages) or remodelling (M2-type) processes.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> All monocytes isolated and used in this study were pretreated with MCSF, which is thought to induce an M2 phenotype.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> We do not know, however, whether viral transduction or the thrombus milieu had an effect on this.</p>
      <p>The development of any treatment that uses exogenous altered cells, promotes their number through bone marrow stimulation, or alters the activity of endogenous circulating cells will rely on a better understanding of how these phenotypes contribute to thrombus resolution.</p>
