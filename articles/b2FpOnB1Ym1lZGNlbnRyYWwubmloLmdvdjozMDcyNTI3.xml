      <abstract>
        <p>Inhibitors of proteasomes have been shown to affect endocytosis of multiple membrane receptors, in particular at the step of cargo sorting for lysosomal degradation. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of proteasomes causes specific redistribution of an endosomal adaptor APPL1, which undergoes initial solubilization from APPL endosomes followed by clustering in the perinuclear region. MG132 treatment decreases APPL1 labeling of endosomes while the staining of the canonical early endosomes with EEA1 remains unaffected. Upon prolonged treatment with proteasome inhibitors, endogenous APPL1 localizes to the site of aggresome formation, with perinuclear APPL1 clusters encapsulated within a vimentin cage and co-localizing with aggregates positive for ubiquitin. The clustering of APPL1 is concomitant with increased ubiquitination and decreased solubility of this protein. We determined that the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 enhances polyubiquitination of APPL1, and the ubiquitin molecules attached to APPL1 are linked through lysine-63. Taken together, these results add APPL1 to only a handful of endogenous cellular proteins known to be recruited to aggresomes induced by proteasomal stress. Moreover, our studies suggest that the proteasome inhibitors that are already in clinical use affect the localization, ubiquitination and solubility of APPL1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a process by which cells internalize extracellular ligands. It is initiated by the inward budding of plasma membrane vesicles containing ligands bound to specific transmembrane receptors. Among other routes, receptors can be internalized via clathrin-coated pits that pinch off, lose their clathrin coat and fuse with an endosomal compartment where the cargo is sorted towards recycling or degradation in lysosomes. Several endosomal populations can be distinguished based on the presence of specific markers as well as functional and morphological characteristics. Early endosomes that contain the small GTPase Rab5 and EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) are the first cargo sorting platform <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A subpopulation of early endosomes, initially characterized by the presence of APPL1 protein as a unique marker <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, are called APPL1-positive vesicles or APPL endosomes <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. From early endosomes various types of cargo are transported to recycling endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes, or towards the Golgi apparatus.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitination acts as a signal for the internalization and sorting of plasma membrane proteins along the endocytic route (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>). In contrast to the well-established function of polyubiquitination in proteasome-dependent protein degradation, the ubiquitination involved in endocytosis does not lead to protein destruction in proteasomes. Still, during endocytic trafficking of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor there are several stages sensitive to the inhibitors of proteasome, namely the sorting from early to late endosomes and the translocation of activated EGF receptor from the outer limiting membrane to the inner membranes of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) <xref rid="bb0025 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. Ubiquitin-dependent sorting is specific to endocytosed cargo, as proteasomal inhibitors block ligand-induced internalization of glutamate receptors, but not of transferrin receptor <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In general, inhibition of proteasomes blocks the sorting of membrane receptors towards degradation without interfering with the transport of soluble proteins or recycling cargo <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The application of proteasome inhibitors decreases the rates of lysosomal degradation of multiple transmembrane receptors, including those for EGF <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, growth hormone and nerve growth factor <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, platelet-derived growth factor <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, hepatocyte growth factor <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, interleukin-2 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the general knowledge about the involvement of ubiquitin–proteasome system in endocytosis, specific effects of proteasome inhibitors on early endosomes are not known. In particular, we were interested in the fate of the subpopulation of early endosomes marked by the presence of APPL1, which act as a sorting and signaling platform. APPL endosomes are positive for Rab5 but not EEA1 (which is a marker for the canonical early endosomes), and are preferentially localized underneath the plasma membrane <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. APPL1 is primarily recruited to endocytic membranes through binding to the small GTPase Rab5. The endocytic compartments are highly dynamic, and changes in the composition of phosphoinositides on early endocytic membranes cause a selective recruitment of either APPL1 or EEA1 to Rab5-positive endosomal vesicles <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. APPL endosomes participate in endocytic trafficking of EGF receptor <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and transferrin receptor (our unpublished results). In addition, they function as platforms for the assembly of signaling complexes that control distinct signal transduction pathways, e.g. the Akt and MAPK pathways <xref rid="bb0015 bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[3,13]</xref>. APPL1, a unique marker of APPL endosomes, interacts with Akt and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, as well as with several membrane receptors (including adiponectin receptor 1 and 2, netrin-1 receptor DCC, follicle stimulating hormone receptor<bold>,</bold> and nerve growth factor receptor TrkA), contributing to signal transduction downstream of these receptors (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>). The cellular functions of APPL1 are not limited to endocytosis, and include also regulation of gene transcription, metabolism, cell proliferation and cell survival <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, we reported that APPL1 can activate β-catenin-dependent transcription <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and interact with the NuRD chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex <xref rid="bb0010 bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[2,16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While proteasomal inhibition affects endocytic trafficking already upon short application (1 h or less), prolonged (12–24 h) treatment causes massive changes in the turnover of cellular proteins. Proteasome deficiency stimulates a cellular stress response by inducing time- and dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, arrest of the cell cycle, apoptosis, as well as the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in the intracellular ROS levels <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Compromised proteasomal function leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins which become sequestered into large, insoluble, non-membranous protein deposits called aggresomes. These structures were first described by Wojcik et al. in HeLa cells treated with a peptide aldehyde proteasomal inhibitor PSI <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and named aggresomes by Johnston et al. <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Aggresomes appear either as a single sphere with a diameter of 1–3 μm positioned at an indentation of the nucleus, or as an extended ribbon around the nuclear envelope <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Aggresomes assemble in the perinuclear region near the microtubule organizing center, and their formation involves trafficking of aggregated proteins along microtubules and reorganization of intermediate filaments <xref rid="bb0095 bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[19–21]</xref>. Aggresomes recruit chaperones, ubiquitination enzymes and components of the ubiquitin–proteasome machinery, to help in the disposal of aggregated proteins. The process of aggresome clearance is largely dependent on the autophagy–lysosome system. The cellular site of aggresome formation is enriched in double-membrane vesicles representing autophagosomes, and blockage of autophagy impairs the clearance of aggresomes <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Lysosomes gather close to the aggresome and eventually digest the proteins forming the inclusions.</p>
      <p>Here, we aimed to characterize an effect of proteasomal inhibition on APPL endosomes. We analyzed the localization and morphometric features of APPL1-positive endosomes upon a range of incubation times with proteasome inhibitors. Strikingly, we observed initial solubilization of APPL1 from endosomal membranes followed by its relocalization to aggresomes which correlated with increased ubiquitination and insolubility of APPL1.</p>

Statistical parameters were calculated per overall area occupied by the cells. Quantification of the endocytic phenotypes included the following parameters: the number of vesicles, the mean apparent area of the cross section of vesicles expressed in μm<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to the average vesicle size), and the total fluorescence of a fluorophore detected in all vesicles, defined as the total integral vesicle intensity.

        <title>Inhibition of proteasomes causes redistribution of APPL1</title>
        <p>In order to investigate the effect of proteasome inhibitors on APPL endosomes, we looked at the distribution of endogenous APPL1 in HeLa cells treated with MG132, ALLN, or bortezomib. Both MG132 and ALLN are cell-permeable peptide aldehydes commonly used as reversible inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity of the proteasome. Bortezomib (Velcade), a dipeptide boronic acid analogue, has increased affinity for the catalytic subunits of the proteasome and reduced multidrug resistance sensitivity. It represents a prototype of highly effective anti-cancer agents, used for treatment of two B-cell malignancies: multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma <xref rid="bb0145 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>. We used MG132 at two concentrations (5 or 10 μM), ALLN at 50 μM, and bortezomib at 1 μM, for times ranging from 1 h till 20 h. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows representative images of maximal intensity projection (MIP) covering the entire cell volume. The individual confocal scans taken from the bottom and the middle of the cells are shown in <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. In DMSO-treated control cells, APPL1-positive endosomes are dispersed in the cytoplasm and in particular concentrated underneath the plasma membrane. One-hour treatment with the inhibitors did not cause any observable changes compared to the control cells (data not shown). Both 6- and 20-h treatments with the inhibitors caused a marked decrease in the number of APPL endosomes close to the ventral cell membrane facing the glass (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, middle panels). Interestingly, we observed clusters of APPL1-positive structures formed in the perinuclear region upon 20-h treatment with MG132, ALLN and bortezomib (<xref rid="f0005 f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 and Fig. S1</xref>, right panels).</p>
        <p>In order to check whether the changes in APPL1 distribution upon prolonged proteasomal inhibition are specific, we looked at the localization of other proteins residing on early or late endosomes as well as at the distribution of other cellular organelles (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We found that the distribution of early endosomal marker Rab5, present on APPL endosomes, followed the pattern of changes displayed by APPL1: both proteins were solubilized from endosomal membranes upon 6-h MG132 treatment, and co-localized in perinuclear clusters upon 20-h treatment. In contrast, EEA1, selectively residing on the canonical early endosomes, showed no obvious redistribution (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). CD63, a marker of late endosomal and lysosomal membranes, changed the localization in cells treated for 20 h with MG132, but it did not co-localize with APPL1 clusters (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The same was true for mitochondria (stained with MitoTracker Orange probe) and the Golgi apparatus (stained with anti-GM130 antibody) (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The observed redistribution of cellular organelles was in agreement with the literature data <xref rid="bb0155 bb0160 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[31–33]</xref>. We conclude that proteasomal stress selectively affects endosomes containing APPL1 and Rab5.</p>
        <p>In order to quantify the extent of observed changes in APPL1 localization, morphometric features of APPL1- and EEA1-containing endosomes were compared using the image analysis software MotionTracking <xref rid="bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[27,28]</xref>. Upon analysis of the double-immunolabelled images, we quantified the following parameters for APPL1 and EEA1 endosomes: the number of vesicles, the average vesicle size (mean apparent area), and the total integral vesicle intensity (sum of fluorescence of all vesicles) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A–C and <xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> shows representative images used for the measurements. We observed that the number of APPL endosomes decreased upon MG132 treatment (to 42% and 51% of control value after 6 and 20 h of MG132 treatment, respectively) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Proteasomal inhibition caused an initial decrease of mean area of APPL vesicles (to 78% of control after 6 h), which returned to the control levels after 20 h (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). In addition, the overall number of APPL1 molecules residing on endosomes dropped upon MG132 treatment (measured as total integral intensity of all vesicles, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C) to 31% and 41% of control value after 6 and 20 h, respectively.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the EEA1 endosomes displayed much less changes. The number of EEA1 endosomes was not affected by MG132 treatment (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The area of EEA1 endosomes was consistently decreased by MG132 treatment at 6 and 20 h (to 75% of control; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Correspondingly, the integral vesicle intensity for EEA1 was reduced to 72% and 70% of control, for 6- and 20-h MG132 treatment, respectively (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Based on this data, we could conclude the following: (a) Inhibition of proteasomes decreased the number of detectable APPL endosomes by half, while it did not affect the number of observed EEA1 vesicles; (b) Mean size of APPL vesicles initially decreased and then returned to the control levels upon MG132 treatment, with a heterogeneous vesicle population after 20 h (bigger vesicles in the perinuclear cluster and smaller ones scattered in the cytoplasm); (c) MG132 treatment solubilized APPL1 from vesicles, as the massive decrease in the amount of APPL1 bound to vesicles could not be explained by the observed changes in the vesicle size; (d) MG132 treatment reduced the size of EEA1 vesicles and, proportionally, the amount of vesicle-bound EEA1. Clearly, MG132 affects both early endosomal compartments (as expected due to multiple morphological changes seen in other membraneous cellular structures). However, the extent and timing of MG132 effects seem to be substantially different in the case of APPL1 and EEA1 endosomes. In the case of EEA1, MG132 treatment primarily affected the vesicle size. In the case of APPL1, changes were much more pronounced and involved the decreased amounts of vesicle-bound APPL1 molecules as well as the decreased number of detectable APPL1-positive vesicles.</p>
        <p>Although the morphometric image analysis provided us with quantitative data, due to averaging of analyzed parameters within endosomal populations it was not optimal for characterizing distinct patterns of APPL1 redistribution upon the two time periods of MG132 treatment. To complement the initial analysis, we counted the number of HeLa cells containing perinuclear clusters of APPL1 upon treatment with DMSO or MG132 for 4 or 20 h. Representative images are shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D. While clusters of APPL1 were a rare event in control cells or upon 4-h MG132 treatment, upon 20-h MG132 application the number of cells containing the perinuclear clusters of APPL1 reached almost 50% of all counted cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>At this point it was important to determine whether perinuclear clustering of APPL1 represents its recruitment to endosomes relocalized in the cell center or a formation of proteinaceous aggregates without a surrounding membrane. We checked this by employing continuous uptake of fluorescently labeled cargo during the incubation with MG132 for 18 h. We used transferrin that is constitutively recycled and EGF that undergoes degradation in lysosomes, both labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. In addition, the cells were stained for APPL1 and for vimentin in order to visualize aggresomes (see <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A for more explanations). As shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F, neither transferrin nor EGF accumulated at the sites of perinuclear APPL1 clusters, suggesting that these are not functional endosomes transporting extracellular cargo. In the cells treated with MG132 for 18 h some peripheral APPL1-positive endosomes contained transferrin, while there was no co-localization of APPL1 and EGF. As previously reported <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, MG132 markedly decreased degradation of EGF, which accumulated in the cells treated with MG132 to a larger extent than in control-treated cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Taken together, the above-presented data allowed concluding that upon a prolonged proteasomal inhibition APPL1 is solubilized from endosomes and relocalizes to the perinuclear region where it forms clusters, which are most likely proteinaceous aggregates. These clusters are not functional cargo-bearing vesicles and do not co-localize with early or late endosomes, mitochondria or the Golgi apparatus.</p>

        <title>Co-localization of clustered APPL1 with aggresomes upon proteasomal inhibition</title>
        <p>As the observed perinuclear clusters of APPL1 did not represent functional endosomes, we wished to further characterize these aggregates. We performed a series of co-stainings of APPL1 with proteins known to participate in aggresome assembly in order to check whether the perinuclear clusters of APPL1 co-localize with an aggresome.</p>
        <p>One of the most typical components of aggresomes is an intermediate filament protein vimentin that during aggresome formation is displaced from its normal fibrillar cellular distribution and forms a cage surrounding the core of aggregated proteins <xref rid="bb0095 bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[19–21]</xref>. <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A shows that APPL1 clusters are confined within the collapsed vimentin cage in cells treated for 20 h with MG132. Markedly, under this treatment every cell containing an aggresome surrounded by vimentin also contains clustered APPL1. The one cell marked with an asterisk in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A has neither collapsed vimentin nor clustered APPL1. Similarly, we saw co-localization of APPL1 and vimentin in cells treated for 20 h with other proteasomal inhibitors, bortezomib and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Interestingly, already upon 6 h of MG132 treatment we could observe cells containing collapsed vimentin cages, but no APPL1 clusters (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Another component of aggresomes formed in response to a failure of proteasome machinery are ubiquitinated proteins <xref rid="bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. We checked whether clusters of APPL1 form at the sites of ubiquitin aggregation by co-staining of APPL1 and ubiquitin. Indeed, all clusters of APPL1 were localized at a close proximity to the perinuclear ubiquitin aggregates (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The third feature of aggresomes is their dependence on transport along microtubules <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We co-treated cells with MG132 and nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent, which prevents the assembly of aggregated proteins into a large perinuclear aggresome. Upon treatment with MG132 for 20 h in the presence of nocodazole, we could neither see the formation of ubiquitin aggregates nor clustering of APPL1 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). However, nocodazole did not affect the localization of APPL1 in DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C).</p>
        <p>It has been previously reported that several endocytic proteins are recruited to aggresomes via their interaction with a protein called ubiquilin that bears ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). These are proteins possessing ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs): Eps15, Hrs and STAM2 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In particular, Eps15 has been shown to participate in the formation of aggresomes <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We expressed GFP-Eps15 in HeLa cells and checked its localization in parallel to an endogenous APPL1 upon treatment with DMSO or MG132 for 6 or 20 h (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). There was no co-localization of Eps15 and APPL1 in control cells or cells treated with MG132 for 6 h. Interestingly, upon 20-h MG132 treatment we observed not only an aggregation of both proteins in the same region of the cells, but also a recruitment of APPL1 to the GFP-positive aggregates in cells expressing high levels of GFP-Eps15 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). In agreement with these observations, we could also detect Eps15 co-precipitating with APPL1 (data not shown).</p>
        <p>On the basis of the above microscopical data, we conclude that the perinuclear clusters of APPL1 formed upon proteasomal inhibition co-localize with the commonly accepted aggresome markers.</p>

        <title>Role of APPL1 in the formation and clearance of aggresomes</title>
        <p>Since other endocytic proteins (i.e. Eps15) have been shown to affect aggresome formation <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we checked the influence of APPL1 on proteasome-dependent aggregation. We overexpressed GFP-APPL1 in HeLa cells and treated them with control DMSO or MG132 for 6 or 20 h. Similarly to an endogenous protein, GFP-APPL1 was localized in punctate endosomal structures under control conditions, as previously reported <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and was solubilized from endosomes upon 6 h of MG132 treatment. Upon 20 h of MG132, GFP-APPL1 was concentrated in multiple large perinuclear structures which were encapsulated by ubiquitin (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). To test whether APPL1 overexpression influences formation of aggresomes, we compared the localization of ubiquitin-rich aggregates in the transfected versus untransfected cells upon treatment with MG132 for 6 and 20 h. Ubiquitin accumulated in perinuclear areas already at 6 h of MG132 treatment, and after 20 h virtually all cells contained aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins. However, the extent of their formation in cells overexpressing GFP-APPL1 did not differ from the neighboring untransfected cells, indicating that an increased level of APPL1 does not modulate or enhance the proteasome-dependent aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Similarly, knockdown of APPL1 by siRNA had no significant effect on the formation of MG132-indduced ubiquitin-rich aggregates (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Since in HeLa cells we achieved only partial silencing of APPL1, it remains formally possible that the complete knockout would affect aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins upon proteasomal impairment. However, it is rather likely that clustering of APPL1 is an event rather successive to than causative of aggresome formation.</p>
        <p>The aggregates formed upon treatment with MG132 are reversible, and typically cells return to their normal morphology within 24–72 h after the removal of the inhibitor. To assess the effect of APPL1 on the clearance of aggresomes, after 18-h incubation with MG132 we washed the cells and allowed them to grow for the next 24 or 48 h in a normal medium. Upon 24 h of recovery time, ubiquitin was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with small cytoplasmic aggregates in 64% of the cells (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). The aggregates were not visible in 12% of control cells, while the cells containing the bigger clusters were classified as “moderate” (20%) or “large” (3%) based on their size (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). After 48-h recovery time, all cells had none or only small ubiquitin aggregates. We reduced the level of APPL1 protein with the help of two independent siRNA duplexes, and counted the cells containing various patterns of ubiquitin distribution after 24-h recovery time. As shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C, silencing of APPL1 had no substantial effects on the clearance of ubiquitin aggregates. However, compared to control cells, in the cells treated with siRNA targeting APPL1, we observed a 5% increase in the number of cells without clusters, which could argue that, if at all, APPL1 might only have a slight modulatory impact on the dynamics of aggresome clearance.</p>

        <title>Ubiquitination of APPL1</title>
        <p>We wanted to investigate whether relocalization of APPL1 to ubiquitin-rich aggresomes is related to any changes in its own ubiquitination status. To check if APPL1 is targeted by ubiquitin, we overexpressed APPL1 together with HA-ubiquitin in HEK293 cells. In such overexpression system we detected additional slower-migrating bands recognized by anti-APPL1 antibodies in APPL1 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). One strong and one weak additional bands were visible, each with an apparent size difference of approximately 10 kDa (marked with arrowheads, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). The HA antibody recognizing the tagged ubiquitin detected a high molecular weight smear in APPL1 immunoprecipitates. The additional bands were not present in APPL1 immunoprecipitates from cells lacking the overexpression of ubiquitin. On the other hand, such additional bands of APPL1 were visible in the lysates upon long exposure (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Thus, APPL1 is subjected to polyubiquitination in ubiquitin-transfected HEK293 cells.</p>
        <p>In order to eliminate potential artifacts which could result from protein overexpression, we checked the ubiquitination of endogenous APPL1 in HeLa cells. We failed to detect ubiquitinated APPL1 under control conditions, but we could see polyubiquitinated species of APPL1 upon overnight treatment with MG132 (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Again, in the APPL1 immunoprecipitates there were multiple bands recognized both by anti-APPL1 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies, as well as a ubiquitin-immunoreactive smear of high molecular weight (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Thus, endogenous APPL1 is ubiquitinated in HeLa cells under proteasomal stress conditions.</p>
        <p>K63-linked polyubiquitination has been reported to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into aggresomes and their subsequent clearance by autophagy <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We wished to determine if the ubiquitin chains conjugated to APPL1 are linked by K63. Thus we overexpressed APPL1 in HEK293 cells together with the wild type HA-tagged ubiquitin or one of the two mutants: with all lysines but K63 mutated to arginine (K63-only), or with K63 single lysine-to-arginine replacement (K63R). The extent of modifications of overall cellular proteins by both ubiquitin mutants was lower than in the case of wild type ubiquitin, which was visible in the lysates probed with anti-HA antibody (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). An anti-HA-reactive band above the size of APPL1 appeared in immunoprecipitates of APPL1 from cells expressing wild type and K63-only ubiquitin (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). In addition, an HA-immunoreactive smear of high molecular weight was formed in the APPL1 immunoprecipitates by the wild type and K63-only ubiquitin, but not by the K63R mutant (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). This result indicates that the ubiquitin molecules conjugated to APPL1 can be linked via a K63-mediated bond.</p>
        <p>One of E3 ubiquitin ligases participating in the modification of endocytic targets via K63-linked ubiquitin chains is Nedd4 (neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4) <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We overexpressed APPL1 and FLAG-ubiquitin with or without human untagged or mouse HA-tagged Nedd4 in HEK293 cells. Compared to control cells, we could detect much stronger, multiple APPL1-immunoreactive bands both in the lysates and the APPL1 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the Nedd4 ligases (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D). In contrast, overexpression of RING-type E3 ligase c-Cbl did not enhance the amount of ubiquitinated APPL1 despite increasing overall ubiquitination of cellular proteins. This would suggest that Nedd4 is a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase for APPL1.</p>

        <title>Solubility of APPL1</title>
        <p>As aggresomes contain high amounts of detergent-insoluble proteins <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we hypothesized that the localization of APPL1 to these structures could result from its enhanced insolubility. To assess if the treatment with MG132 alters the solubility of APPL1, we examined the total, soluble and insoluble fractions of HeLa cells treated with DMSO or MG132 from 1 to 20 h. Upon protein extraction with RIPA buffer, APPL1 was almost completely soluble in untreated and DMSO-treated cells. Its solubility was decreased with the increasing time of MG132 treatment (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, APPL1 short exposure). Accordingly, we saw a corresponding increase of APPL1 levels in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Upon 20-h treatment with MG132, additional APPL1-immunoreactive bands were detected, in particular in the insoluble cell fraction (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, APPL1 long exposure). As controls we probed for EEA1 (an endosomal protein which remains soluble after detergent extraction), HDAC2 (a nuclear, chromatin-bound and predominantly insoluble protein) and α-tubulin. While the solubility of EEA1 was not altered, HDAC2 and α-tubulin displayed a slight decrease in solubility upon MG132 treatment (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). With respect to the total protein levels, 20 h of MG132 treatment induced decrease in APPL1 and EEA1, but not the other tested proteins (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). This data suggested that APPL1 becomes insoluble under the same conditions that evoke APPL1 clustering.</p>
        <p>In order to check whether ubiquitin conjugates could correspond to the observed additional bands of APPL1 appearing in an insoluble fraction of HeLa upon prolonged MG132 treatment (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A), we performed a similar experiment in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with APPL1 and HA-ubiquitin. We blotted the soluble and insoluble fractions for HA, APPL1 and EEA1, and performed an immunoisolation of APPL1 from the soluble fraction (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). While MG132 only moderately increased the overall level of the soluble ubiquitinated proteins upon 20-h treatment, much more ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in an insoluble cell fraction upon 20-h treatment by MG132 or ALLN (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). In agreement with the data from HeLa cells, both these treatments led to enhanced insolubility of APPL1 and the appearance of multiple APPL1 bands in an insoluble fraction of HEK293 cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). In addition, the prolonged MG132 or ALLN treatment caused an increase in the levels of ubiquitinated species present in APPL1 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). Similar results were obtained using two concentrations of bortezomib, that after 20 h caused increased ubiquitination and insolubility of APPL1 (<xref rid="f0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, proteasomal stress induces ubiquitination of APPL1 and the formation of clusters of ubiquitinated insoluble APPL1.</p>

        <title>Changes in APPL1 distribution and solubility depend on protein synthesis</title>
        <p>Efficient protein biosynthesis is prerequisite for the formation of aggresomes stimulated by bortezomib <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We checked how the inhibition of translation with cycloheximide affects the changes in APPL1 distribution and insolubility, and in particular the formation of clusters. In addition to MG132, we incubated HeLa cells with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. We observed a complete loss of clusters in the cells co-treated with MG132 and cycloheximide for 20 h, in comparison to over 50% of cells containing clusters under MG132-only condition (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). As expected, co-staining of APPL1 and vimentin showed lack of aggresomes in the cells co-treated with MG132 and cycloheximide for 20 h, like in control cells and in clear contrast to the cells treated with MG132 alone (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Since impairment of proteasome machinery results in an accumulation of proteasomally degraded proteins, we checked for total levels of APPL1 in cells treated with MG132 with or without cycloheximide. HeLa cells treated for 20 h with DMSO or MG132 were incubated for the last 3 h or for the whole 20 h with cycloheximide. The normalized amounts of lysates were blotted for APPL1, Nedd4, EEA1, and control proteins: HDAC2 and α-tubulin (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). Cycloheximide decreased the APPL1 level after 3 and 20 h (compare lanes 1, 3, and 5, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). In agreement with data from <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, 20 h of MG132 treatment decreased the amount of APPL1 (compare lanes 1 and 2, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). Interestingly, co-treatment with cycloheximide resulted in stabilization of the total APPL1 level (compare lanes 5–6 with 1–2, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). In parallel, blocking of protein synthesis decreased the levels of Nedd4 and EEA1. In fact, the levels of EEA1 were affected by cycloheximide and MG132 treatment in a manner similar to that described for APPL1 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). On the other hand, the levels of control proteins, HDAC2 and α-tubulin, were decreased by 20-h treatment with cycloheximide, and not affected by MG132 co-treatment (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). We also blotted for APPL1 in the soluble and insoluble HeLa fractions after co-treatment with MG132 and cycloheximide. Strikingly, the ladder of APPL1 appearing upon 20-h MG132 treatment was not present in the cells co-treated with cycloheximide (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D). This suggests that the impairment in protein synthesis results in a coordinated lack of aggresomes and APPL1 clusters, which is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of ubiquitinated insoluble APPL1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recent years brought a number of reports that describe the participation of an adaptor protein APPL1 in processes related to cellular growth, proliferation and survival, which at the molecular level are linked with signal transduction, membrane traffic, and gene transcription <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The ubiquitin–proteasome system is closely related to all the above processes, and its dysfunction is associated with a number of pathologies. When the proteasome function is compromised, or upon overexpression of proteins normally degraded in proteasomes, ubiquitinated, misfolded and insoluble proteins accumulate and become sequestered into large perinuclear inclusion bodies called aggresomes <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the growing importance of APPL endosomes, we wished to characterize their fate upon proteasomal stress. Strikingly, we observed a solubilization of APPL1 from endosomal membranes which made further observations of this endosome class impossible, since APPL1 is its unique marker. Instead, a prolonged treatment with all tested proteasome inhibitors caused clustering of APPL1 protein in the perinuclear region. Employing the commonly accepted criteria, we confirmed that endogenous APPL1 is recruited to aggresomes formed upon proteasomal inhibition. This discovery is particularly significant as there are only a handful of known endogenous proteins that become sequestered in aggresomes.</p>
      <p>It could be expected that the formation of an aggresome interferes with the proper localization of perinuclear cellular structures, such as the Golgi complex, mitochondria and lysosomes, which was confirmed in our observations. However, APPL1 endosomes are preferentially located at the cell periphery, and proteasome inhibition seems to affect specifically their marker protein APPL1 but not a marker of the canonical early endosomes EEA1. MG132 markedly decreases APPL1 labeling of endosomes, while the total amount of APPL1 protein in the cell is only slightly changed. The perinuclear APPL1 clusters form in about 50% of cells treated with MG132 for 20 h, and they meet the criteria describing aggresome formation: (a) the perinuclear clusters of APPL1 are surrounded by a cage of vimentin (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A); (b) the APPL1 and ubiquitin clusters co-localize in the same focal plane of an optical section (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B); (c) clustering of APPL1 is inhibited by a microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole, which also prevents aggresome assembly <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C); (d) upon MG132 treatment APPL1 is ubiquitinated (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B); (e) upon proteasome inhibition APPL1 accumulates in a detergent-insoluble fraction (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>); (f) clustering and ubiquitination of APPL1 depend on protein synthesis (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Based on this evidence, we conclude that proteasomal inhibition induces recruitment of ubiquitinated and aggregated APPL1 to aggresomes. In HEK293 cells overexpressing ubiquitin, APPL1 becomes polyubiquitinated with a contribution of K63-linked ubiquitin chains and the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 can enhance such polyubiquitination reaction (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This is particularly interesting in the view of recent reports showing that the non-degradative K63-linked polyubiquitination promotes sequestration of proteins into aggresomes <xref rid="bb0180 bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[36,40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There could be at least three explanations for the observed recruitment of APPL1 to aggresomes induced by the proteasomal stress. Firstly, if APPL1 was normally a target for proteasomal degradation, the blockage of proteasomes might have caused an excessive accumulation and aggregation of APPL1. Since we do not observe an increase in the total APPL1 protein level upon MG132 treatment, this simple explanation is unlikely. Secondly, proteasomal stress could cause damage to APPL1 which stays misfolded and aggregated due to the sequestration of cellular chaperones that could otherwise help to refold it. Thirdly, APPL1 might co-assembly with other aggregation-prone proteins. Since APPL1 co-localizes with aggregates formed by overexpressed GFP-Eps15 upon MG132 treatment (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D), one such candidate could be ubiquilin, which has both ubiquitin-binding and ubiquitin-like domains, that binds to Eps15 and recruits it to aggresomes <xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[34,35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is currently believed that aggresomes represent a protective cellular response to stress conditions. Importantly, the ubiquitin–proteasome system and protein aggregation are implicated in the pathogenesis of several genetic and neurodegenerative disorders <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib used in our study is approved for treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and its antineoplastic activity has been reported in a variety of solid and hematological cancers <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A new generation of proteasome inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties are being developed and await testing for their efficiency in treatment of other types of malignancies and immune-mediated disorders <xref rid="bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[43,44]</xref>. Our studies suggest that in clinical practice such proteasome inhibitors may have some impact on endocytic adaptor proteins, as they can affect the localization, ubiquitination and solubility of APPL1. An identification of the signaling pathways that promote aggresome formation and clearance could be vital for elucidating the pathophysiology of many diseases associated with protein misfolding. It would be interesting to check if APPL1 co-localizes with aggresomes formed under disease-relevant conditions other than proteasomal inhibition, such as overexpression of huntingtin with polyglutamine expansion or the deletion mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR).</p>

        <p>Changed distribution of APPL1 upon proteasomal inhibition. HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were treated for 20 h with 5 μM MG132, 50 μM ALLN, 1 μM bortezomib, or a corresponding amount of DMSO (the solvent control). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for APPL1 followed by Alexa555-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. The panels show maximum intensity projections (MIP) of z-stacks containing 7–9 confocal images taken every 0.5 μm throughout the entire volume of the cells.

A detailed description is given in <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Material and methods</xref> section. Ten MIPs were analyzed for every condition; each MIP was assembled from images taken at three confocal planes (bottom, middle, and top of the cells). The results represent averaged values of each parameter with standard deviation, and are expressed as a percentage of control values obtained from DMSO-treated cells. (A) The number of vesicles containing APPL1 or EEA1. (B) Mean area of vesicles positive for APPL1 or EEA1. (C) Total integral fluorescence intensity of vesicles containing APPL1 or EEA1. (D) Clustering of APPL1 in HeLa cells treated with proteasome inhibitor. Cells were treated with MG132 for 4 or 20 h, or control DMSO for 20 h. The panels show representative images used for analysis in E. Bar, 20 μm. (E) Quantification of the perinuclear clusters of APPL1. Seven random images were taken for each condition and the cells containing clustered APPL1 were counted and expressed as a percentage of all scored cells (n indicates the number of scored cells). The graph shows averaged results with standard deviation of an experiment done in duplicate, representative of three independent experiments. (F) HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were treated with DMSO or 5 μM MG132 in the presence of fluorescently labeled EGF-Alexa 488 (1 μg/ml) or transferrin-Alexa 488 (2.5 μg/ml).

        <p>Ubiquitination of APPL1. (A) Ectopically expressed APPL1 is ubiquitinated in HEK293 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with untagged APPL1 and HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) as indicated, and 48 h later lysed in RIPA buffer. APPL1 and tagged ubiquitin were detected by Western blotting in the immunoprecipitates (IP) of APPL1 and control rabbit immunoglobulins (Ig). The arrowheads indicate the positions of ubiquitinated APPL1 species. Both short and long exposures of the blots are shown. (B) Ubiquitination of endogenous APPL1 in HeLa cells is enhanced by MG132. HeLa cells were treated with DMSO or 5 μM MG132 overnight and lysed in RIPA supplemented with 10 mM NEM. The resulting lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-APPL1 antibodies. APPL1 and ubiquitin were detected by Western blotting. (C) APPL1 is modified with K63-linked ubiquitin chains. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the untagged APPL1 and the indicated HA-ubiquitin (Ha-Ub) constructs. After 48 h the cells were treated with 5 μM MG132 for 1 h prior to lysis in RIPA buffer. Lysates and immunoprecipitates with anti-APPL1 antibodies were blotted for HA and APPL1. Asterisks indicate a position of unmodified APPL1. (D) Ubiquitination of APPL1 is enhanced by Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs, and 48 h later lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates and APPL1 immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted as indicated.
