        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined by the presence of a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), play critical roles throughout the secretory pathway and in mitochondria, yet the machinery responsible for their proper membrane insertion remains poorly characterized. Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The biogenesis of transmembrane proteins presents the cell with several compounding challenges. Prior to membrane insertion, hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) are prone to aggregation, and the spontaneous insertion of TMDs across lipid bilayers, even when thermodynamically favored, can be slow. Moreover, proteins containing TMDs must find their correct target membrane for insertion among the different membrane-surrounded compartments present in eukaryotic cells. To face these challenges, cells have evolved diverse mechanisms for chaperoning membrane proteins, often from the earliest stages of their biosynthesis on the ribosome to their proper destinations. Such pathways have been the subject of intense investigations and include the signal recognition particle (SRP)/Sec61 translocon system that imports secretory pathway proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref rid="bib15 bib41 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Egea et al., 2005; Rapoport et al., 1999; Wickner and Schekman, 2005</xref>) and the transport inner membrane/transport outer membrane (Tim/Tom) translocases that mediate insertion of transmembrane proteins into both mitochondrial membranes (<xref rid="bib36 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Neupert, 1997; Pfanner and Meijer, 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>Far less is known about the machinery responsible for the insertion of an important class of proteins that are anchored to the lipid bilayer by a single TMD located near their C termini. This topological arrangement allows tail-anchored (TA) proteins to be tethered to internal membranes while presenting their functional N-terminal domains to the cytosol (<xref rid="bib7 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001</xref>). TA proteins are found throughout the secretory pathway, in the nuclear envelope, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. Within the secretory pathway, TA proteins play diverse roles, such as enabling vesicular traffic (e.g., many of the SNAREs, which mediate fusion of secretory vesicles, are TA proteins [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beilharz et al., 2003</xref>]), aiding in protein translocation, and promoting folding or degradation of membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib7 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001</xref>). Secretory pathway TA proteins are first inserted into the ER membrane, and are then sorted to their ultimate destination (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bulbarelli et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, mitochondrial TA proteins are inserted directly into the mitochondrial membrane, where they facilitate mitochondrial fission, provide key components of the translocation machinery, and act in apoptosis (<xref rid="bib7 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001</xref>). The membrane specificity of TA proteins is largely encoded in their TMDs and flanking regions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Egan et al., 1999</xref>). These signals, however, are not absolute, as some TA proteins, such as the mammalian oncoprotein Bcl2 (<xref rid="bib29 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krajewski et al., 1993; Lithgow et al., 1994</xref>), are found in both the mitochondria and the ER. Moreover, it is not well understood how targeting determinants in the TMDs are decoded by cellular machinery (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Borgese et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because of its position near the C terminus, the TMD of TA proteins is occluded by the ribosome until translation is completed. Thus, TA proteins cannot exploit the classic cotranslational SRP/Sec61 translocation mechanism used by most secretory pathway proteins (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yabal et al., 2003</xref>). Early studies with cell extracts indicated that some TA proteins, such as CytB5, could integrate into membranes without the assistance of specialized machinery (<xref rid="bib8 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Brambillasca et al., 2006; Rachubinski et al., 1980</xref>). However, most TA proteins, such as the mammalian Sec61β and synaptobrevin, have more hydrophobic TMDs, rendering them reliant on an incompletely characterized, ATP-dependent mechanism (<xref rid="bib2 bib22 bib46 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al., 2007; High and Abell, 2004; Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, biochemical studies identified the mammalian soluble ATPase, Asna1/TRC40, as part of a cytosolic complex that interacts with the newly synthesized TA protein, Sec61β, in vitro (<xref rid="bib46 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008</xref>). This complex can then deliver Sec61β to the surface of ER-derived vesicles (microsomes), where upon it can undergo ATP-dependent membrane insertion. While these studies have provided critical molecular insights into the ATP-dependent biogenesis of TA proteins, they leave several important questions unaddressed. First, it is unclear how broad a role the Asna1/TRC40 system plays in vivo. Indeed, a recent report established that the cytosolic chaperone pair Hsc70/Hsp40 is sufficient to mediate efficient ATP-dependent insertion of Sec61β in vitro (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the identity of the proteins necessary for recruiting Asna1/TRC40 to the ER is unknown. Finally, it is unknown how cells ensure proper partitioning of TA proteins between the ER and mitochondria.</p>
      <p>Based on a large-scale genetic interaction map of the secretory pathway, we previously suggested that three otherwise unassociated yeast proteins (Mdm39/Get1, Rmd7/Get2, and Arr4/Get3, the yeast homolog of Asna1/TRC40) cooperate to carry out a common function that strongly impacts on trafficking and, accordingly, named them Get1–3 (Golgi ER trafficking 1–3) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>). In agreement with this idea, we and others have found that all three Get proteins physically associate (<xref rid="bib3 bib23 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2002; Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>), and that loss of any of the <italic>GET</italic> genes leads to a pronounced Kar2 secretion phenotype, suggestive of a defect in retrograde Golgi to ER trafficking (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>). However, the full range of phenotypes that have now been reported for the respective <italic>get</italic> deletions are difficult to reconcile with an isolated defect in trafficking. These include mitochondrial dismorphogenesis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dimmer et al., 2002</xref>) for <italic>Δget1 (Δmdm39)</italic>; defects in DNA replication or damage response (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Zewail et al., 2003</xref>) and V-type ATPase dysfunction (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sambade et al., 2005</xref>) for <italic>Δget2 (Δhur2/Δrmd7)</italic>; sensitivity to toxic metal ions (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2003</xref>) and effects on protein degradation machinery (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006</xref>) for <italic>Δget3 (Δarr4)</italic>; and defects in meiotic spore formation (<xref rid="bib3 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006; Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003</xref>) for all deletions in <italic>GET</italic> genes. Thus, the underlying molecular function(s) of the Get proteins, and the extent to which they are working together to perform a single molecular role, remained unresolved.</p>
      <p>Here we show, both in vivo and in vitro, that the GET complex is the machinery responsible for insertion of secretory pathway TA proteins into the ER membrane, and that the reduction in inserted TA proteins can, in turn, explain the wide array of phenotypes observed for deletions in the <italic>GET</italic> genes.</p>

        <title>Get1 and Get2 Form a Membrane Receptor for Get3 on the Face of the ER</title>
        <p>We began our functional analysis of the GET complex by exploring how Get1 and Get2 determine the subcellular localization of Get3 (for analysis of the physical and functional relationship between the Get proteins see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1 and S2</xref> available online). Earlier studies established that Get3, which, unlike Get1 and Get2, is not predicted to have TMDs, is found on the surface of the ER as well as in the cytosol. Moreover, in the absence of Get1 and/or Get2, Get3 loses its ER localization, and is found both in the cytosol as well as in poorly characterized punctate structures (<xref rid="bib3 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>). Here we reveal that, rather than being membrane vesicles, these punctate structures are in fact cytosolic detergent-insoluble aggregates (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). We further show, through in vitro experiments with microsomes and proteoliposomes containing Get1 and Get2, that the Get1/Get2 complex is directly responsible for recruiting Get3 to the ER membrane in an ATP-independent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This appears to be the primary role of Get1/2 complex, as, in the absence of Get3, there is no apparent additional cost to deleting Get1/2 (<xref rid="bib3 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). The fact that Get3 shuttles between the cytosol and the ER suggests that it may deliver substrates to the membrane. In the context of this model, the formation of aggregates and the exacerbated phenotype found in <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> cells (<xref rid="bib3 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>) would be explained by disruption of the Get3 cycle, leading to sequestration of potential substrates.</p>

        <title>Get3 Binds the TA Protein Sed5 and Is Necessary for Its Membrane Targeting</title>
        <p>To help identify factors that might be shuttled from the cytosol to the ER by the GET system, we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen for polypeptides that can interact with Get3. Y2H analysis, which reports on weak interactions occurring within the nucleus of assayed strains, is well suited for identifying Get3 binding proteins, as it can detect transient interactions that are independent of the presence of Get1 and Get2. We used yeast expressing Get3 as bait to screen a genomic library encoding prey proteins (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 1996</xref>). Physical interactions caused activation of the Gal4-driven HIS3 reporter gene, allowing growth on plates lacking histidine. The strongest hit from the screen was a fragment of Sed5 (amino acid 197 to the C terminus) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), a TA protein that acts as a SNARE in vesicular traffic within the Golgi and between the Golgi and the ER (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick and Pelham, 1992</xref>). The Get3-Sed5 interaction was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal TMD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We next examined whether Get3, as part of the GET complex, plays a role in recruiting newly synthesized Sed5 in the cytosol and inserting it into membranes. We visualized the subcellular localization of Sed5 with an N-terminal fusion protein with GFP (GFP-Sed5) (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>). N-terminal GFP fusion was compatible with the correct targeting of Sed5 to the Golgi in control cells (<xref rid="bib4 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Banfield et al., 1994; Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Deletion of Get3 led to a large pool of soluble protein and a corresponding decrease in Golgi-like puncta containing Sed5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). In a <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> background, this defect was more pronounced; there was only modest Golgi staining and, instead, we observed cytosolic fluorescence and a few large punctate structures that were distinct from the Golgi, as visualized by Anp1-GFP staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to Get3 (Get3-tdRFP) and GFP-Sed5 colocalized in these punctate structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Thus, in the absence of the Get proteins, a substantial fraction of Sed5 remains in the cytosol. Consistent with this, subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that deletion of the <italic>GET</italic> genes leads to reduced levels of endogenous untagged Sed5 in membranes, while not interfering with membrane association of the Golgi protein Emp47 or the ER protein Sec61 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Decreased Sed5 SNARE activity in vesicles traveling between the Golgi and ER could slow down retrograde traffic and reduce the efficiency of cellular retrieval mechanisms of ER resident proteins (<xref rid="bib21 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Hardwick and Pelham, 1992; Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore tested whether reduced Sed5 function could explain the Kar2 secretion phenotype observed in the <italic>get</italic> mutants. Consistent with this hypothesis, lowering protein levels of the essential Sed5 protein, by using a repressible tetO<sub>7</sub> promoter (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mnaimneh et al., 2004</xref>), caused Kar2 secretion at levels that were similar to those observed in deletions of GET complex members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Moreover, overexpression of Sed5, presumably by allowing sufficient Sed5 to insert into membranes by alternate, potentially spontaneous TA-insertion pathways (see <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>), suppressed the Kar2 secretion defect in a triple-deletion strain that has no GET complex members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). We therefore conclude that the GET complex plays a major role in the biogenesis of the TA protein Sed5. In addition, the Kar2 secretion phenotype of these cells could be explained by the reduced levels of Sed5 in the membranes of <italic>get</italic> deletion mutants.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>The GET Complex Plays a Broad Role in Insertion of TA Proteins into Membranes</title>
        <p>The role of the GET complex as a specific chaperone system for the TA protein Sed5 cannot explain the diversity of the phenotypes displayed by deletions of <italic>GET</italic> genes. The recent finding that the mammalian Get3 homolog Asna1 was involved in the insertion of in vitro synthesized Sec61β (<xref rid="bib46 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008</xref>) suggests that the GET complex has a broader role in TA protein biogenesis. Consistent with this idea, by a directed Y2H approach, we detected physical interactions between Get3 and several additional secretory pathway TA proteins, including the SNAREs Tlg2 and Sec22 and the peroxisomal TA protein Pex15. These interactions, as observed for Sed5, were dependent on the presence of the C-terminal TMD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Although these data suggest that Get3 can specifically recognize a range of C-terminally located TMDs, it appears to have some selectivity, as we could not detect physical interactions for the mitochondrial TA protein Fis1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), which, like other mitochondrial TA proteins, has a shorter, more hydrophilic TMD than secretory pathway TA proteins (<xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Beilharz et al., 2003; Borgese et al., 2001, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether the observed physical interactions reflect an in vivo role for the GET complex in the biogenesis of secretory pathway TA proteins, we looked at the effect of loss of the Get1/Get2 receptor on the subcellular localization of a functionally diverse range of TA proteins. We focused predominantly on ER-localized TA proteins, as interpretation of effects on their localization is not complicated by trafficking defects seen in <italic>get</italic> mutant strains. Accordingly, we expressed N-terminal fluorescent protein fusions to Sbh1, Sbh2—the yeast homolog of Sec61β shown to interact with Asna1 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</xref>)—Scs2, and Ysy6. As observed for Sed5, localization of these TA proteins was normal in control cells, but was altered in a <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> background (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). During logarithmic growth, we could observe both the presence of large puncta (that colocalize with Get3) and also proper ER localization, (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). Following the diauxic shift, which occurs as cells exit log phase, we observed a more pronounced defect. In most cells, the majority of the protein was either cytosolic or in one or two large puncta that also contained Get3 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>). These defects are specific for TA proteins entering the secretory pathway, as the two mitochondrial TA proteins examined (Fis1 and Tom22) properly localized in both the control and a <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> background (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Loss of the GET Complex Leads to Mislocalization of a Subset of TA Proteins</title>
        <p>The finding that Get3 is able to distinguish between TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway and those destined to mitochondria suggests that, in addition to increasing the efficiency of TA protein membrane insertion, the GET complex helps ensure that TA proteins accurately find their destination membrane. Consistent with this idea, we observed that, when overexpressed, a subset of secretory pathway TA proteins mislocalize to mitochondria in <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> strains (an example of the TA protein Ubc6 is given in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). This effect was particularly pronounced for Pex15. In wild-type (WT) cells, this protein is thought to be first inserted into the ER, and then transported to the peroxisome via Pex19 (<xref rid="bib16 bib24 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Elgersma et al., 1997; Hoepfner et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2005</xref>) (supported by data in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>). However, in <italic>Δget1/Δget2</italic> cells, Pex15 initially formed cytosolic aggregates (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S8</xref>), but, after extended overexpression, began to appear in mitochondrial membranes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). This suggests that, once Pex15 saturated Get3, it could insert inappropriately into mitochondrial membranes. Indeed, we observed that, in the absence of Get3, this lag phase is shortened dramatically, and Pex15 is found in the mitochondria at much earlier time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Hence, in addition to increasing the efficiency of insertion of TA proteins, recognition by Get3 represents a key decision step in defining the membrane destination of a TA protein, thus overcoming the intrinsic potential for TA proteins to spontaneously insert into a wide range of membranes.</p>

        <title>Loss of TA Proteins Recapitulates the Pleiotropic GET Phenotypes</title>
        <p>The diversity of TA protein functions suggests that the pleiotropic effects associated with loss of the GET complex might be a secondary consequence of TA protein mislocalization. To test this idea, we assembled a library of strains carrying mutant alleles for each of the predicted 55 yeast TA proteins (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beilharz et al., 2003</xref>) (including the six TA proteins localized to mitochondria), and plated these strains on various conditions for which we observed sensitivity in the <italic>get</italic> deletion strains. The library consisted of 43 deletion strains (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>) for nonessential TA proteins and 12 hypomorphic alleles of the essential ones. Hypomorphic alleles were made by using the decreased abundance by mRNA perturbation (DAmP) method (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>), which typically results in ∼5- to 10-fold decrease in levels of the endogenous protein.</p>
        <p>We found that loss of a large number of TA proteins (<italic>Δpep12</italic>, <italic>Δtlg2</italic>, <italic>Δsec22</italic>, <italic>Δvam3</italic>, <italic>Δscs2</italic>, <italic>Δsso2</italic>, <italic>Δgos1</italic>, and <italic>bos1-DAmP</italic>) caused pronounced copper sensitivity (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> for the most sensitive strains). This is consistent with an important role of the late secretory pathway in cellular copper homeostasis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Labbe and Thiele, 1999</xref>). More generally, individual TA protein mutant strains were sensitive to only a subset of the conditions. However, for every condition tested, we found a subset of TA protein deletions/depletions that fully recapitulate the sensitivities found in the <italic>Δget1</italic> and <italic>Δget2</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the strains with strongest sensitivities). Thus, a broad defect in secretory pathway TA protein insertion could fully account for the diverse phenotypes observed upon loss of the Get1/Get2 receptor.</p>

        <title>In Vitro Evidence that the GET Complex Directly Mediates Insertion of Newly Synthesized TA Proteins into the ER membrane</title>
        <p>The above studies establish that the Get proteins play a critical role in the biosynthesis and proper localization of a wide range of TA proteins. Given the pleiotropy of phenotypes displayed by the <italic>get</italic> deletants, we wished to assess whether the Get proteins are directly required for insertion of TA proteins into the ER membrane. We therefore developed an in vitro system for studying this process, which takes advantage of our ability to prepare cytosol extracts and microsomes from <italic>get</italic> mutant yeast strains.</p>
        <p>To monitor membrane insertion, we engineered a glycosylation site after the TA sequence of each substrate examined. Following translocation, this site is expected to gain access to the glycosylation machinery in the lumen of the ER (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Borgese et al. [2001]</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S9</xref>) and, as such, serve as a proxy for translocation. Indeed, when we combined cytosol and microsomes from WT cells, we observed efficient translocation of preproalpha factor (a canonical Sec61 substrate) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) and of the three secretory pathway TA proteins that we tested: Sed5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), Sec22 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and 6D), and Ysy6 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S9</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect any translocation of the mitochondrial TA protein Fis1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating that our in vitro system faithfully recapitulates the target membrane specificity of TA protein insertion.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the role of the Get proteins in TA protein insertion, we prepared extracts from a <italic>Δget3</italic> strain and microsomes from a <italic>Δget1/2</italic> strain. Strikingly, these mutant extracts and microsomes were defective for insertion of TA proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B–6D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>), while being fully proficient in supporting the translocation of preproalpha factor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A and data not shown). Addition of recombinant Get3 to <italic>Δget3</italic> extracts during (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), but not after (data not shown), translation allowed for robust insertion, thus demonstrating that this defect is a proximal consequence of not having Get3 in the in vitro system, and not due to altered cellular physiology in <italic>Δget3</italic> strains. Get3 also appears to be limiting in our WT extracts, as we saw enhanced translocation when recombinant Get3 was added (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>). Critically, this Get3-mediated insertion is completely dependent on the presence of the Get1/2 complex in the microsomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>), providing further evidence that these three proteins cooperate to carry out insertion of TA proteins. Taken together, these data establish that the GET system is directly responsible for mediating insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into the ER membrane.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study defines a pathway by which cells ensure the efficient and accurate biogenesis of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. The soluble cytosolic ATPase, Get3, specifically queries newly synthesized proteins for the presence of C-terminally localized hydrophobic domains. Get1 and Get2 then serve as an ER membrane receptor, which recruits the Get3-TA complex, thereby promoting the proper insertion of TA proteins into the ER (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). Once inserted, TA proteins can then be routed to their ultimate destination within the secretory pathway. In the absence of the heteromeric Get1/Get2 receptor, TA proteins bound to Get3 fail to reach ER membranes, and are instead trapped in large cytosolic aggregates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). This leads to a broad depletion of TA proteins, which in turn can account for the otherwise confusing array of phenotypes associated with loss of Get proteins. Binding to Get3 is also a decisive step in the insertion pathway, as in its absence, secretory pathway TA proteins may insert into mitochondrial membranes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>
      <p>The finding that the GET pathway is not essential for yeast viability provides in vivo support to in vitro studies that had suggested additional mechanisms by which TA proteins can find their destination membranes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rabu and High, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, several considerations suggest that the GET pathway is the major route used to target a broad range of TA proteins to the secretory pathway. First, our Y2H analysis indicates that Get3 can bind multiple secretory pathway TA proteins in a TMD-dependent manner. Second, for all secretory pathway TA proteins examined, the interaction with Get3 caused sequestration of the TA proteins into cellular aggregates in the absence of Get1 and Get2. This suggests that, when Get3 is present, most of the natural flux of TA proteins flows through the GET pathway. Indeed, yeast fail to grow when Get3 is overexpressed in the absence of Get1 and Get2 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). Third, deletion of Get3, which would eliminate the GET pathway without actively preventing TA proteins from utilizing alternate pathways by trapping them in nonproductive Get3 complexes, still leads to diverse cellular defects. Finally, in vitro reconstitution experiments directly establish that Get3 cooperates with the Get1/2 complex in mediating the insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins. Thus the ability of cells to survive in the complete absence of the Get proteins may be analogous to the viability of yeast missing the SRP, which is made possible by the existence of alternate pathways for insertion of the numerous secreted and membrane-bound proteins that normally utilize this machinery (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ogg et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>Possible alternate routes for TA protein biogenesis that have been suggested by in vitro studies include spontaneous insertion, which occurs efficiently for some TA proteins, such as CytB5 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brambillasca et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, purified Hsc70/Hsp40 can promote the ATP-dependent (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al., 2007</xref>) and SRP the GTP-dependent insertion of other TA proteins, such as Sec61β, (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al., 2004</xref>). Such back-up systems, however, would lack the strong membrane specificity conferred by the ER localization of the Get1/2 complex, as well as the preferential binding of Get3 to TA proteins destined to the secretory pathway. The potential importance of such specificity is illustrated by the observation that some TA proteins, including Pex15 and Ubc6, mislocalize to the mitochondria when the GET system is impaired. This argues that, shortly after synthesis, Get3 competes with other factors (possibly Hsc70 and/or components that play an analogous role to Get3 in the targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins) for TMD binding, and that Get3 recognition commits the TA proteins to their subsequent insertion into ER membrane. It remains to be determined whether a dedicated protein machinery exists that ensures the accurate targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins, or whether the shorter, more hydrophilic nature of their TMDs prevents Get3 binding, thereby allowing for efficient, spontaneous insertion into the mitochondria.</p>
      <p>The interaction between Get3 and a TA protein substrate may thus represent a critical and potentially regulated decision step for establishing the destination target of TA proteins. Regulation could globally alter Get3 function or specifically affect the interaction between Get3 and target TA proteins. Along these lines, we have recently found that the function of Get3 is modulated by its redox state (our unpublished data and <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Metz et al. [2006]</xref>). In addition, Get3 is transcriptionally upregulated under both cytosolic (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Auld et al., 2006</xref>) and ER (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Travers et al., 2000</xref>) stress conditions. It has also been found that many TA proteins are palmitoylated (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2006</xref>) or phosphorylated (such as for Sed5 [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>]) on residues that are immediately adjacent to the TMD. Such modifications could modulate Get3 recognition by creating negatively charged flanking regions or by altering the hydrophobicity of the TMD, thereby enabling the coordinated regulation of subclasses of TA proteins and altering the physiology of the cell.</p>
      <p>While the present studies focused on TA biogenesis in yeast, recent observations suggest that the GET pathway plays an essential role in TA biogenesis in higher eukaryotes. Biochemical studies revealed that the mammalian Get3 homolog, Asna1/TRC40, binds the TA protein, Sec61β, and facilitates its posttranslational insertion into ER membranes (<xref rid="bib46 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008</xref>). An in vivo role of Asna1 in TA biosynthesis in metazoans is suggested by the impaired capacity for insulin secretion in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mutants of <italic>asna1</italic> (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2007</xref>). In light of our findings, an attractive hypothesis is that impaired insulin secretion results from compromised biogenesis of one or more of the SNARE TA proteins. The broader importance of the GET pathway is underscored by the finding that complete loss of <italic>ASNA1</italic> causes early embryonic lethality in mice (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>) and arrested growth at the L1 stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2007</xref>). The molecular identity of the Get3 ER receptor in metazoans remains to be established. However, we find that Ysy6 translated in rabbit reticulocyte extracts inserts into yeast microsomes in a Get1/2-dependent manner, suggesting that the GET pathway is highly conserved (data not shown). Consistent with this, PSI-BLAST analysis identifies the WRB protein as an excellent and ubiquitously expressed candidate for a Get1 ortholog.</p>
      <p>In summary, the GET complex in yeast and likely metazoans constitutes the major machinery necessary for membrane selective, and ATP-dependent insertion of TA proteins. This finding should now enable mechanistic studies to explore central questions, including how the GET system selects substrate and exploits ATP hydrolysis to overcome the energetic barriers to insertion of transmembrane proteins into lipid bilayers.</p>

        <p>Unless indicated otherwise, reactions were programmed with 1 μl of mRNA (0.1–1.0 μg) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Further translation was stopped by addition of cycloheximide (1 mM). Microsomes (0.06 OD<sub>280</sub>) were then added and translocation allowed to proceed for an additional 30 min at room temperature. RNAs were digested with an RNase cocktail (Ambion). Finally, loading buffer was added and the translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimager analysis.</p>

        <p>(B) Fluorescence microscopy of a time course monitoring the subcellular localizations of the peroxisomal TA protein GFP-Pex15 as well as dsRED targeted to the mitochondria (MTS-RFP) following induction of Pex15 from a galactose inducible promoter in a control (WT), <italic>get1/2</italic>, or <italic>get3</italic> strain.</p>

        <p>Reduced Levels of TA Proteins Can Explain the Diverse Array of GET Complex Phenotypes</p>
        <p>Serial dilutions in different conditions: SD + CuSO<sub>4</sub> (Cu), SD + hydroxyurea (HU), SD + tunicamycin (Tunic.), SD + hygromycin (Hygro.), and YPD incubated at 39°C (39°C). Strains shown are: control cells (WT), <italic>get</italic> mutants, five TA protein deletion strains, and a strain carrying a hypomorphic allele (DAmP) of an essential TA protein. Copper sensitivity in the Δget3 strain is more pronounced in methionine prototrophic than auxotrophic cells. We used Δmet15 cells for this panel, resulting in a less sensitive phenotype compared with MET<sup>+</sup> cells depicted in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>.</p>

        <p>In Vitro Reconstitution of GET-Dependent Insertion of TA Proteins</p>
        <p>(A) Autoradiograph of in vitro-translated, <sup>35</sup>S methionine-labeled, α-factor (αfac) following incubation in the presence of microsomes derived from WT or Δ<italic>get1/2</italic> strains. The position of untranslocated prepro-αfac and glycosylated, translocated pro-αfac (gαfac) are indicated.</p>
        <p>(B) Autoradiograph of in vitro translated, <sup>35</sup>S methionine-labeled Sed5 and Fis1 following incubation with microsomes derived from WT or Δ<italic>get1/2</italic> strains. Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti-opsin antibody and then treated with EndoH, as indicated. The position of untranslocated Sed5 and Fis1 as well as glycosylated translocated Sed5 (gSed5) are indicated.</p>
        <p>(C) Graph representing the dose dependence of Sec22 translocation on addition of recombinant Get3 to either WT- or Δg<italic>et3</italic>-derived translation extracts. WT microsomes were added following translation, and the amount of glycosylated Sec22 relative to total Sec22 was calculated. Results from three independent experiments are shown; data are presented as mean ± SD.</p>
        <p>(D) Autoradiograph of in vitro-translated, <sup>35</sup>S methionine labeled, Sec22 following translation in WT cytosol supplemented with optimal levels of Get3. Translocation was terminated at the indicated times following addition of microsomes derived from either WT or <italic>Δget1/2</italic> strains. The position of untranslocated Sec22 as well as glycosylated translocated Sec22 (gSec22) are indicated.</p>

        <p>Schematic Model for GET Complex Function</p>
        <p>(Top) WT cells. Get3 recognizes newly synthesized, ER-destined TA proteins. The Get3-TA complexes dock onto the Get1/Get2 receptor. This allows insertion of TA proteins.</p>
        <p>(Middle) Cells lacking the receptor (<italic>Δget1/2</italic>). Get3-TA complexes fail to reach the ER and, instead, are sequestered in cytosolic aggregates.</p>
        <p>(Bottom) Cells lacking Get3 (<italic>Δget3</italic>). Newly synthesized TA proteins intended for the ER are no longer shuttled into the GET pathway. To varying degrees, depending on the TA proteins, they may use alternate ATP/GTP-dependant pathways or spontaneous routes for membrane insertion. This could lead to misinsertion into the mitochondria, inefficient insertion into the ER, or aggregation in the cytosol.</p>
