        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>To investigate the relationship between stem cells in normal epithelium and in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), we examined expression of a panel of human epidermal stem cell markers in SCCs and SCC cell lines. Markers that are co-expressed in normal stem cells were not co-expressed in SCC. Downregulation of two markers, Lrig1 and MAP4, and upregulation of a third, MCSP, correlated with poor differentiation status and increased proliferation in primary tumours. We conclude that SCCs do not reflect a simple expansion of stem cells; rather, tumour cells hijack the homeostatic controls that operate in normal stem cells, eliminating those that maintain stem cell quiescence.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stratified squamous epithelia act as a protective interface between the body and the environment. They have a simple organisation: proliferation takes place in the basal layer of cells attached to an underlying basement membrane, and cells undergo terminal differentiation as they move towards the tissue surface <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The outermost cell layers are shed throughout adult life and are replaced through proliferation of a subpopulation of cells in the basal layer known as stem cells <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Examples of stratified squamous epithelia are the epidermis, the lining of the oral cavity, the cervix and oesophagus.</p>
      <p>One of the characteristic tumours of stratified squamous epithelia is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These tumours retain hallmarks of the normal epithelial terminal differentiation programme; however, proliferation is increased, the proportion of differentiated cells is decreased, and the spatial organisation of the cell layers is disrupted <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. There is evidence that SCCs are maintained by a subpopulation of proliferative cells termed cancer stem cells, which are responsible for tumour maintenance and for regrowth following conventional treatment <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>At present little is known about the relationship between stem cells in normal stratified squamous epithelia and stem cells in SCCs. However, it is generally believed that oncogenic changes in stem cells are responsible for SCC development because stem cells are the only long-lived cells within stratified epithelia <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We recently generated single cell cDNA libraries from normal human epidermal cells and used them to identify a panel of 14 stem cell markers <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the present report, we have investigated their expression in SCC, with a view to discovering the relationship between stem cells in normal stratified squamous epithelia and SCC.</p>

        <p>Primary human keratinocytes from neonatal foreskin (strains kj, kt and kw), adult oral mucosa (strain OK) and the SCC lines SCC9, SCC12B.2, SCC13, SCC15, SCC25, SCC27 <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref> and H376 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> were cultured in the presence of Mitomycin-C treated J2-3T3 feeder cells as described previously <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Stocks of A431 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin. In clonal growth assays all cells, including A431 cells, were cultured with a feeder layer in the standard keratinocyte medium. For RNA and protein isolation the medium of all cultures was changed the day before analysis to fresh standard keratinocyte medium.</p>
        <p>Cell fractionation by rapid adhesion to 40 μg/ml type I collagen was performed as described previously <xref rid="bib4 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[4,9]</xref>. For cell sorting, cells were labelled with Alexa 647 anti-human β1-integrin antibody (Serotec), washed and subjected to flow cytometry using a Dako MoFlo high-speed cell sorter. Fractions of 100 cells were collected from the 10% of cells expressing highest (β1<sup>high</sup>) and lowest (β1<sup>low</sup>) levels of β1-integrin in addition to all β1-integrin positive cells (All sort) and subjected to clonal analysis as described previously <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Human oral SCCs, normal oral mucosa and normal skin were obtained with appropriate ethical approval. Frozen tissue sections were fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilised for 5 min with 0.4% Triton X-100. After blocking with 10% FCS in PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h with antibodies diluted in 10% FCS in PBS. Cells and sections were washed with 10% FCS in PBS between incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. Antibodies were used against the following antigens: MCSP, MAP4 (9.2.27 and clone 18, BD Life Sciences), Lrig1 (gift from Dr. Satoshi Itami) and Ki67 (NCL-L-Ki67-MM1, Novocastra). Secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 were obtained from Invitrogen.</p>
        <p>Sections were mounted with Moviol and examined using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. For quantitative measurements sections were examined with a 20× objective using the Ariol<sup>®</sup> system manufactured by Applied Imaging. This generated a numerical value that reflected both staining intensity and the proportion of tissue with detectable staining.</p>

        <title>Expression of stem cell markers in human squamous cell carcinoma lines</title>
        <p>We used real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to examine gene expression levels of the 14 recently described human epidermal stem cell markers in a panel of human SCC cell lines. Five lines were derived from tumours of the oral cavity (SCC9, SCC15, SCC25, SCC27 and H376), two from facial epidermis (SCC12B.2 and SCC13) and one from the vulva (A431). RNA was also isolated from primary keratinocytes derived from normal human epidermis or oral mucosa.</p>
        <p>The SCC lines represented a range of ability to proliferate and differentiate in culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[5–7,10]</xref>. All lines except for SCC25 showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in colony forming efficiency and expressed lower levels of the differentiation marker, <italic>involucrin</italic>, compared to epidermal and oral keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, by the criteria of increased clonal growth ability and reduced involucrin expression <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> the SCC lines appear to contain a higher proportion of stem cells than primary keratinocytes.</p>
        <p>We used Q-PCR to examine the expression of the 14 recently described human epidermal stem cell markers <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Since most of the SCC lines were derived from the oral cavity, we also compared marker expression in normal oral and epidermal keratinocytes. Marker expression in keratinocytes from the two sites was similar, except for <italic>FRMD4A</italic>, an ERM domain-containing protein involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement, which was expressed at higher levels by oral keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The markers could be assigned to three categories, according to whether expression was decreased, increased, or variable in SCC lines compared to normal epidermal keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The two markers that were consistently downregulated in the SCC lines were microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) and Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (Lrig1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). MAP4 is reported to regulate cell cycle progression and to be ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, whereas Lrig1 is a negative regulator of the EGF receptor and mediates epidermal stem cell quiescence <xref rid="bib4 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[4,12,13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The markers that were consistently upregulated in SCC lines were: <italic>FRMD4A</italic>; oxidative stress response gene 1 (<italic>OSR1</italic> or <italic>C20orf111</italic>); guanidine nucleotide binding protein 1-like protein (<italic>GNL1</italic> or <italic>HSR1</italic>), which is another stress response gene; a serine kinase, phosphorylase b kinase (<italic>PYK</italic>), and <italic>FLJ12875</italic>, a regulator of the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade. The upregulation was most striking in the case of <italic>FRMD4A</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B); however, since expression was high in normal oral keratinocytes we conclude that elevated <italic>FRMD4A</italic> expression may reflect the site of origin rather than the malignant status of the cells.</p>
        <p>The final category of markers showed variable expression among the SCC lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). These were the putative ring finger protein <italic>KIAA1991</italic>; <italic>FAM120B</italic>, a protein containing domains associated with DNA repair; <italic>Rnase5</italic>, which is involved in mRNA degradation; the cell surface proteoglycan <italic>MCSP</italic>; Additional Sex Combs-like 1 (<italic>Asxl-1</italic>), which modulates polycomb and trithorax activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; a putative transcription factor, zinc finger protein 187 (<italic>Zfp187)</italic>; and dimethyladenosine transferase 1-like (<italic>DIMT1L</italic>), which regulates ribosome activity. It is worth noting that although MCSP is in the ‘variable’ category, it was upregulated in five out of seven primary SCC lines from oral and facial epithelia.</p>

        <title>Isolation of clonogenic SCC cells</title>
        <p>Human epidermal stem cells can be enriched by selecting the basal cells that express the highest levels of β1-integrins and adhere most rapidly to collagen <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The SCC lines examined express similar β1-integrin levels to normal oral and epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether we could enrich for clonogenic SCC cells on the basis of adhesiveness. In the case of SCC9 and SCC12B.2, the 10% of cells with the highest β1-integrin levels (β1<sup>high</sup>) had a significantly higher colony forming efficiency than all sorted cells and the 10% of cells with the lowest levels (β1<sup>low</sup>) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C). This was not observed for SCC27; however the colonies formed by β1<sup>high</sup> SCC27 cells were larger than colonies formed by β1<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). Thus, as in normal epidermal keratinocytes, it is possible to enrich for clonogenic SCCs on the basis of high β1-integrin expression.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the observed expression patterns in the SCC derived lines reflected variation within the undifferentiated, clonogenic cells, we performed Q-PCR on cDNA generated from cells fractionated on the basis of rapid adhesion to collagen, which reflects high β1-integrin levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). In SCC9, SCC12B.2 and SCC27 cells and oral keratinocytes the relative levels of marker expression when compared to epidermal keratinocytes were largely the same as in unfractionated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E). FRMD4A was upregulated in oral keratinocytes and SCC cells compared to epidermal keratinocytes. MAP4 expression was reduced in all the SCC lines and MCSP expression was variable, expression being lowest in SCC12B.2 and highest in SCC27, reflecting the changes observed in unfractionated cells. However, whereas reduced Lrig1 expression was a consistent characteristic of unfractionated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), the levels of Lrig1 were remarkably similar in the enriched populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). Thus, clonogenic cells in SCC lines and primary keratinocytes express similar levels of Lrig1. The decrease in Lrig1 expression that characterises SCC lines may therefore be associated with expansion of the transit amplifying compartment.</p>

        <title>Studies in primary tumours</title>
        <p>The data from the SCC lines make two predictions about marker expression in primary tumours: that markers that are co-expressed in the basal layer of normal epidermis are not co-expressed in SCCs; and that downregulation of MAP4 and Lrig1 is a characteristic feature of SCCs. Support for the second prediction came from analysis of a publicly available gene data set deposited at Oncomine <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. We found that MAP4 and Lrig1 were significantly downregulated in oral SCCs, while CD44, which has recently been reported to be a marker of tumour initiating cells in head and neck SCCs <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and MCSP were highly upregulated (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To examine the sites of marker expression, we stained sections of 18 human oral SCCs, one adenoid cystic carcinoma, one lymph node metastasis of an oral SCC and two specimens of normal skin, as well as four samples of normal oral mucosa. We evaluated proliferative status by Ki67 labelling and graded the differentiation status of the tumours according to standard criteria <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Expression levels in normal and tumour tissue were scored by eye as negative (−/+), weak (+), moderate (++) or strong (+++), based on the intensity and extent of staining (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We confirmed our scoring for Lrig1 expression on one sample of normal skin and five tumours, picked at random using an Applied Imaging Ariol<sup>®</sup> system. The results were as follows (visual score in brackets): normal epidermis, 78 ± 3 (+++); tumour W3, 49 ± 6 (++); tumour P3, 21 ± 3 (+/−); tumour M4, 32 ± 12 (+); tumour M7, 33 ± 10 (+/−); tumour MET1, 17 ± 7 (−). There was thus good agreement between the visual and automated scores.</p>
        <p>As reported previously <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, in normal epidermis Lrig1 and MCSP were expressed most abundantly in clusters of putative stem cells in the basal layer (brackets in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). MAP4 was expressed throughout the epidermal basal layer, expression being highest in the stem cell clusters (brackets in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Thus, in normal epidermis Lrig1, MCSP and MAP4 were co-expressed, expression being highest in the putative SC clusters that are known to be less frequently dividing than other cells in the basal layer <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As predicted, expression of Lrig1 and MAP4 was markedly decreased in tumours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D, F–H and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The number of cells expressing Lrig1 was reduced, as was the labelling intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D). In tumours, there was a general reduction in MAP4 staining intensity, irrespective of differentiation status (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F–H). Moreover, low levels of MAP4 expression extended throughout the tumour mass, whereas in normal epidermis expression was confined to the basal layer.</p>
        <p>There was a tight correlation between expression of Lrig1 and the degree of tumour differentiation, as reported previously <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Lrig1 was detected in well and moderately differentiated tumours but was markedly reduced in poorly differentiated tumours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D). In 4/5 poorly differentiated tumours Lrig1 was either undetectable (−) or expressed in only occasional cells (−/+ or +). In one tumour most areas had only a few positive cells (+), although there was one region with more extensive staining (++). Ki67 positive cells did not express Lrig1, consistent with its role as a negative regulator of proliferation (data not shown). In well and moderately differentiated tumours Lrig1 was detected in the suprabasal layers, correlating with areas that were Ki67 negative and consistent with Lrig1 expression in normal oral mucosa (data not shown, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>While Lrig1 and MAP4 expression was decreased in tumours, MCSP expression was upregulated (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D). In well and moderately differentiated tumours MCSP expression was largely confined to the epithelial layer adjacent to the tumour stroma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B and C). In poorly differentiated tumours MCSP was expressed throughout the tumour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D). Whereas Lrig1 and MCSP are co-expressed in the basal layer of normal epidermis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A), MCSP positive cells in tumours lacked Lrig1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B–D).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The panel of markers that were co-expressed in keratinocytes from normal human epidermis <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> were, with the exception of FRMD4A, expressed at similar levels in keratinocyte from normal oral mucosa. Furthermore, we could enrich for clonogenic, putative stem cells on the basis of high β1-integrin expression and rapid adhesion to collagen in normal epidermal and oral keratinocytes, and in some of the SCC lines examined. While we did not examine inter-clonal differences within the SCC lines <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the overall increase in colony forming efficiency and decrease in <italic>involucrin</italic> expression would indicate an expansion of the stem cell compartment. Nevertheless, these features did not correlate with increased expression of the entire panel of stem cell markers. Instead, while some markers were upregulated, two were downregulated and the remainder showed variable changes amongst the different SCC lines. In addition, basal cells in SCCs did not maintain the full complement of markers normally observed in the basal layer of oral and epidermal epithelium. Thus, there is no evidence for expansion of the normal stem cell compartment in SCCs.</p>
      <p>Downregulation of MAP4 and Lrig1 and upregulation of MCSP were consistent features of SCC lines and primary tumours. Lrig1 is known to negatively regulate EGFR signalling, thereby maintaining epidermal stem cells in a quiescent, nondividing state <xref rid="bib4 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[4,21]</xref>. It is likely that loss of Lrig1 in SCCs, which is associated with a poor prognosis <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>, will confer a significant growth advantage in the basal layer, and lead to an expansion of committed progenitors via upregulation of EGFR signalling. Just as loss of Lrig1 will impact on a variety of signalling pathways, so will upregulation of MCSP. MCSP activates the small GTPases CDC42 and Rac1 via an integrin-mediated pathway <xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>. This is intriguing as we previously reported increased expression of the small GTPase Rac1 in SCCs as well as the tumour promoting role of altered epidermal integrin expression <xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. Less is known about the likely consequences of loss of MAP4 in SCCs. MAP4 undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications and interacts with a number of different proteins that regulate cell cycle progression and cytokinesis <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We speculate that reduced levels of MAP4 in SCCs facilitate more rapid cell cycle progression; however, this remains to be tested.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated the existence of cellular heterogeneity in SCC lines, based on the expression of β1 integrins and ability to adhere to extracellular matrix components. In three out of four genes analysed, differences in expression observed in the clonogenic cell-enriched fraction reflected differences in the total cell population. The notable exception was Lrig1. While Lrig1 was consistently downregulated in unfractionated SCC lines and primary tumours, the levels of Lrig1 in the stem cell-enriched fractions were remarkably similar to normal oral and epidermal stem cells. This suggests that there is a subpopulation of SCC cells that are subject to negative regulation of EGFR signalling. Their existence is important clinically, because these cells will be less likely to respond to drugs that target cells with elevated EGFR signalling and may be capable of reinitiating tumour growth following therapy. In addition, it will be important to determine whether tumour initiation is a general feature of basal cells with high β1-integrin levels, or whether a combination of markers such as CD44, MCSP and Lrig1 will allow further enrichment.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data favour a model whereby during tumour development the pathways that control epithelial homeostasis are lost, particularly in the basal cell layer closest to the tumour stroma. Those markers of normal stem cells that exert a positive effect on proliferation or inhibit differentiation are upregulated, while those that normally retain the cells in a nondividing state show reduced expression. As we find out more about how different signalling pathways intersect to maintain homeostasis we will have more opportunities for restoring homeostasis in tumours.</p>
