        <p>Cardiac vegetations result from bacterium–platelet adherence, activation and aggregation, and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in infective endocarditis. The GPIIb/IIIa and FcγRIIa platelet receptors play a central role in platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation induced by endocarditis pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, but the influence of known polymorphisms of these receptors on the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is unknown. We determined the GPIIIa platelet antigen Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype of healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 160) and patients with infective endocarditis (<italic>n</italic> = 40), and investigated the influence of these polymorphisms on clinical outcome in infective endocarditis and <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions in vitro. Platelet receptor genotype did not correlate with development of infective endocarditis, vegetation characteristics on echocardiogram or the composite clinical end-point of embolism, heart failure, need for surgery or mortality (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all), even though patients with the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> genotype had increased in vivo platelet activation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Furthermore, neither GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> nor FcγRIIa H131R genotype influenced <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet adhesion, activation or aggregation in vitro (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Taken together, our data suggest that the GPIIIa and FcγRIIa platelet receptor polymorphisms do not influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions in vitro or the clinical course of infective endocarditis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Infective endocarditis is a life-threatening condition resulting from infection of native and prosthetic heart valves, implanted medical devices and large vessels <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In recent years, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has overtaken viridans streptococci as the commonest causative agent, accounting for up to 49% of cases <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. This is worrisome as <italic>S. aureus</italic> infective endocarditis has mortality rates as high as 56% <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and underlying cardiac risk factors cannot be identified in over 50% of patients <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Vegetations containing bacteria, fibrin and activated platelets <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>, are identified in up to 95% of patients with infective endocarditis, with increased vegetation size associated with embolism and mortality <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[8–10]</xref>. When encased in vegetations, bacteria are able to evade the host immune system and antibiotic therapies, while still being able to grow and disseminate <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>. Bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation leading to vegetation formation through the initial binding of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) to platelet glycoprotein receptors GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb via plasma protein cross-bridges <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The subsequent cross-linking of specific immunoglobulins bound to these MSCRAMMs with the FcγRIIa receptor on the platelet surface results in platelet activation, followed by platelet aggregation mediated by the formation of fibrinogen bridges between GPIIb/IIIa receptors <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GPIIb/IIIa is a heterodimeric integrin protein linked noncovalently by disulphide bridges <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is the most abundant platelet receptor with 80,000 copies per platelet, and is implicated in platelet aggregation induced by a range of agonists <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. First described in 1989, the GPIIIa platelet antigen (Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup>) polymorphism consists of a thymine to cytosine substitution at nucleotide 1565 that modulates myosin light chain dephosphorylation, resulting in increased ‘outside-in’ signaling <xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>. Previous studies have identified enhanced platelet aggregation in response to pharmacological agonists, and increased susceptibility to vascular and immune disease in Pl<sup>A2</sup> carriers <xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[15–17]</xref>. It is feasible that the Pl<sup>A2</sup> allele is also associated with enhanced bacterium–platelet interactions, vegetation formation and adverse outcome in infective endocarditis.</p>
      <p>FcγRIIa is a low affinity IgG-Fc receptor, numbering between 1300 and 8500 on the platelet surface <xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. A functional polymorphism resulting from a G to A point mutation leads to an arginine (R) to histidine (H) change at position 131, with codominant expression of both alleles <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. The H131 allotype exhibits increased binding to human IgG<sub>2</sub> and IgG<sub>3</sub> and has been associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus on meta-analysis <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. However, the influence of this polymorphism on susceptibility to infective endocarditis is unknown.</p>
      <p>In as much as bacterium–platelet interactions are central to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, we examined the influence of the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and the FcγRIIa H131R platelet receptor polymorphisms on <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation in vitro and clinical outcome in patients with infective endocarditis.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>One hundred and sixty healthy volunteers with no evidence of clinically significant co-existing conditions, recent infection or drug therapy were recruited in Edinburgh between July 2007 and March 2009. Forty patients admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis fulfilling the modified Duke criteria <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, were recruited between November 2006 and March 2009. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 y and inability to provide consent. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and all studies were conducted following approval from the Lothian NHS Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

        <title>Clinical outcomes and definitions</title>
        <p>Data for patients with infective endocarditis were collected prospectively for the index presentation. The diagnosis of embolism was based on clinical examination and non-invasive radiological examinations were performed at the lead clinician’s discretion. Cutaneous manifestations were excluded, as their etiology is considered multifactorial <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Systematic computed tomography surveillance for embolism was not performed. The composite clinical end-point was defined as the presence of embolism, heart failure, need for surgery or death in patients with infective endocarditis within 3 months of diagnosis.</p>

        <title>Echocardiography</title>
        <p>Echocardiographic images were acquired from transthoracic and/or transesophageal windows performed during the acute phase of the infective endocarditis process using 2-dimensional transducers capable of second and ultra-harmonic imaging, attached to either Vingmed (GE Healthcare, Bedford, UK) or iE33 (Philips, Surrey, UK) platforms. All data were stored digitally. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic images were independently reviewed on EchoPAC v 7.0.1 for the PC (GE Healthcare Vingmed Ultrasound, Bedford, UK) by two experienced observers (DKD and GJP) who were blinded to subject data including clinical history and platelet receptor genotype. Vegetations were identified as distinctly abnormal echogenic masses attached to the endothelial surface of valves or endocardium. The largest length and width obtainable in any one frame throughout the cardiac cycle was measured for the largest vegetation if more than one vegetation was present <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Blood sampling</title>
        <p>Venepuncture was performed using a 19-gauge (1.1 mm) needle or a 7 French (2.3 mm) triple-lumen central venous catheter in situ. Care was taken to ensure a smooth blood draw with minimal trauma. Where blood was sampled from a central venous catheter, the initial 10 ml was discarded to minimize sample contamination with heparin. Venous blood (9 ml) was drawn into tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid at a final concentration of 1.6 mg/ml for genotyping of platelet receptor polymorphisms in both healthy volunteers and patients with infective endocarditis. Venous blood (3 ml) was drawn into tubes containing 75 μM <sc>d</sc>-phenylalanyl-<sc>l</sc>-propyl-<sc>l</sc>-arginine chloromethylketone (Haematologic Technologies Inc, VT, USA) for determination of platelet activation in patients with infective endocarditis.</p>
        <p>Blood samples for isolation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for platelet aggregometry and flow cytometry were taken from selected healthy volunteers into 50 ml syringes containing 0.38% (w/v) sodium citrate. For the isolation of washed platelets, blood from healthy subjects was drawn into 50 ml syringes containing 15% (w/v) acid-citrate dextrose (7.32 g/l citric acid anhydrous, 22 g/l sodium citrate, 24.52 g/l dextrose). PRP and washed platelets were generated as described below.</p>

        <title>Generation of PRP and washed platelets</title>
        <p>Citrated blood from healthy volunteers was centrifuged at 150<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to generate PRP. The PRP fraction was removed and an aliquot was further centrifuged at 1500<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to generate platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Autologous PPP was used to standardize PRP to a platelet count of 200 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l after the platelet count was determined on a Coulter<sup>®</sup> A.T™ series analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., High Wycombe, UK).</p>
        <p>For preparation of washed platelets, PRP was generated from blood anticoagulated with acid-citrate dextrose and adjusted to a pH of 6.5 with acid-citrate dextrose, prior to addition of 1 μM prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> (Sigma, Dorset, UK) and 1 U/ml apyrase (Sigma, Dorset, UK). Samples were centrifuged at 720<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to obtain a platelet pellet, which was gently resuspended in modified HEPES-Tyrode’s (JNL) buffer (6 mM dextrose, 130 mM NaCl, 9 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM TRIS-base, 3 mM KCl, 0.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.9 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4) <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Washed platelet suspensions were standardized to a platelet count of 200 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l in JNL buffer, with addition of 1 mg/ml human fibrinogen (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

Bacterial growth was assessed by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) using a spectrophotometer (Cecil Aurius CE2021, Thistle Scientific Ltd., Glasgow, UK). Stationary phase was defined as an OD<sub>600</sub> value greater than 12 following culture for 16 h, while exponential phase was defined as an OD<sub>600</sub> value of between 0.5 and 0.9.</p>
        <p>For platelet activation and aggregation studies, bacterial cultures were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended to an OD<sub>600</sub> value of 1.6. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet adhesion studies, cultures were washed twice in cold 0.05 M Tris–HCl buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.02 M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, pH 7.25. Bacteria were labeled with 100 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma, Dorset, UK) before incubation in the dark for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by twice washing in Tyrode’s solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 12 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5.5 mM dextrose, pH 7.4) and resuspension to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.6 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Platelet aggregometry</title>
        <p>Platelet aggregometry was performed as described previously <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Briefly, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> bacterial cells (in 25 μl PBS) were added to 4.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> platelets (in 225 μl PRP or washed platelets) in siliconized glass cuvettes with constant stirring at 37 °C. Platelet aggregation was assayed by light transmission in a PAP-4 aggregometer (Bio-Data, Alpha Laboratories, Eastleigh, UK) in triplicate. PPP and JNL buffer were used as the 100% light transmission references for PRP and washed platelets respectively. The pharmacological protease activated receptor type 1 agonist SFLLRN–NH<sub>2</sub> (0.1 μM; Clinalfa, Läufelfingen, Switzerland) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 5 μM; Trinity Biotech, Wicklow, Ireland) were used as agonist positive controls. The lag time to platelet aggregation was measured as the time from addition of agonist to the initiation of platelet aggregation up to a 25 min limit. The maximal percentage platelet aggregation was also determined.</p>

          <p>Within 5 min of transfer into a <sc>d</sc>-phenylalanyl-<sc>l</sc>-propyl-<sc>l</sc>-arginine chloromethylketone tube, blood was labeled at room temperature with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies for determination of in vivo platelet activation <xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[26,27]</xref>. Briefly, mouse anti-human CD14-phycoerythrin (PE; Inverness Medical, Stockport, UK) and anti-CD42a-FITC were added to 60 μl of blood at a 1:40 dilution for detection of platelet–monocyte aggregates (PMA). Anti-CD42a-FITC and mouse anti-human CD62P-PE (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) at a 1:2 dilution were used to label 5 μl of blood for detection of platelet P-selectin expression. The appropriate isotope mouse IgG<sub>1</sub> antibodies (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) and flow buffer served as negative controls. Following 20 min of immunolabelling, PMA samples were fixed with 500 μl FACS lyse solution (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and P-selectin samples with 1.425 ml 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde.</p>
          <p>Platelet activation was quantified within 24 h of sample fixation using dual-channel flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) with at least 2000 monocytes and 7500 platelets collected for each assay. PMAs were defined as monocytes expressing CD14 that were also positive for CD42a, and P-selectin-expressing platelets were defined as platelets that were positive for CD62P. Data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK), and results expressed as a percentage of the monocyte or platelet cell population respectively.</p>
          <p>For determination of agonist-induced platelet P-selectin expression in vitro, bacterial suspensions were added to PRP at a ratio of 10:1, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and labeled with 2% anti-CD42a-FITC, anti-CD62P-PE or the appropriate IgG<sub>1</sub> isotype control for 30 min. Samples were fixed with 1 ml 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, and platelet P-selectin expression was determined as described above using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). SFLLRN–NH<sub>2</sub> (1 μM) was used as a positive control.</p>

        <p>Adherence of bacteria to immobilized fibrinogen and fibronectin was performed as previously described <xref rid="bib25 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[25,28]</xref>. Briefly, 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Nunc, Loughborough, UK) were coated with serial dilutions of 100 μl of 0–50 μg/ml human fibrinogen or bovine fibronectin in PBS, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Plates were thrice washed with 100 μl PBS, and then incubated with 100 μl of 2 mg/ml filter-sterilised bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Dorset, UK) for 1 h at 37 °C. <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells (1.25 × 10<sup>8</sup>) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C under constant rotation, fixed with 100 μl 25% (v/v) formaldehyde (VWR, Lutterworth, UK) for 30 min at room temperature, stained with 100 μl 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma, Dorset, UK) for 1 min, and washed three times with 100 μl PBS between each fixing or staining stage. The absorbance at 590 nm (A<sub>590</sub>) was determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader (VERSAmax microplate reader, Molecular Devices, Wokingham).</p>

        <p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS v. 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) for Macintosh. The chi-squared test was used to compare polymorphism frequencies and the normality of data distribution was determined using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were used to analyze the relationship between platelet receptor genotype and numerical data, while Fisher’s exact and the chi-squared tests were used to determine the correlation between platelet receptor polymorphisms and categorical variables.

        <title>Characteristics of the study population</title>
        <p>Clinical characteristics of 40 recruited patients with infective endocarditis (75% male, 56 ± 17 y) are outlined in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients were recruited into the study 12 ± 15 d after diagnosis. The mitral or aortic valves were affected in 87% of cases, with streptococci and staphylococci collectively accounting for 70% of cases of infective endocarditis. Just over a third of patients had underlying valvular heart disease or prosthetic valves, 15% had a past history of infective endocarditis and 10% were intravenous drug abusers. Vegetations were identified in 78% of subjects, and vegetation dimensions were measured in 97% of patients using transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiographic images acquired 7 ± 8 d after diagnosis. Clinically detected emboli were present in 38% of cases, heart failure in 30%, 63% required surgical treatment and the mortality rate in our patient cohort was 23%. The composite clinical end-point of embolism, heart failure, need for surgery and heart failure was present in 75% of patients. Out of the 160 healthy volunteers, 33% were male with a mean age of 30 ± 10 y.</p>

        <p>We determined the distribution of the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R polymorphisms in patients with infective endocarditis and all allelic variants were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic> = 0.686 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.770, respectively).

        <title>In vivo platelet activation and clinical outcome</title>
        <p>We analyzed the association of GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype with in vivo platelet activation and clinical characteristics in patients with infective endocarditis. Given the modest study population, a composite clinical end-point was used.</p>
        <p>Baseline demographic variables for subjects stratified by GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> genotype are outlined in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. As only one subject had the Pl<sup>A2/A2</sup> genotype, data for this individual were excluded from all analyses. Apart from an association of the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> genotype with infection by staphylococci or streptococci (<italic>P</italic> = 0.030; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> polymorphism did not influence background factors in patients with infective endocarditis. The GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> genotype was associated with increased in vivo platelet activation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001 for PMA and <italic>P</italic> = 0.026 for platelet P-selectin expression; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and reduced embolism (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, there were no correlations of the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> polymorphism with vegetation characteristics or the composite clinical end-point of embolism, heart failure, need for surgery or mortality (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all).</p>
        <p>Demographic variables for patients with infective endocarditis, categorized by FcγRIIa H131R genotype, are depicted in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Apart from an association of the R131 allele with solitary aortic valve infection (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005), clinical characteristics did not vary with FcγRIIa H131R genotype. Platelet activation, measured as both PMA and platelet P-selectin expression, did not vary with FcγRIIa H131R genotype (<italic>P</italic> = 0.656 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.891 respectively; data not shown). Although the H/R genotype was associated with reduced need for surgery (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005; <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and the H131 allele with the development of heart failure (<italic>P</italic> = 0.024; <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), there were no correlations between FcγRIIa H131R genotype, vegetation characteristics or the composite clinical end-point.</p>

        <title>Bacterium–platelet interactions in vitro</title>
        <p>In order to investigate the influence of platelet receptor polymorphisms on <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions, we examined <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation in vitro using platelets from healthy volunteers of different GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In total, six different bacterial preparations, including <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain Newman and two clinical isolates from infective endocarditis (strains 207 and 209), grown to both exponential and stationary phases of growth, were used in platelet interaction studies. <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain 207 grown to stationary phase did not induce platelet aggregation within 25 min and was therefore not utilized as an agonist in further <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interaction studies. The <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains employed exhibited differences in the capacity to adhere to immobilized fibrinogen and fibronectin in vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the exponential phase of growth, strain Newman demonstrated weak binding to fibronectin, and strain 207 did not adhere to fibronectin at all. In stationary phase, all three strains adhered to fibrinogen with the highest affinity exhibited by strain Newman (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Platelet aggregometry was performed with PRP obtained from 88 of the 160 healthy volunteers (40% male, 30 ± 9 y), selected to represent different GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotypes (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Results obtained using Pl<sup>A2/A2</sup> platelets were excluded from all analyses given the small number of subjects in this group (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and the highly variable data (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). An association of GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> genotype with reduced lag time to aggregation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.038) was apparent for one of the six bacterial agonists examined (exponential phase Newman; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), while an increase in percentage aggregation of GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> platelets (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033) was observed for another bacterial agonist (stationary phase 209; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Exponential phase 209 was associated with reduced percentage aggregation of platelets with the FcγRIIa R/R genotype (<italic>P</italic> = 0.043; <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). For all other bacterial agonist preparations, there were no differences in aggregation of platelets of different GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> or FcγRIIa H131R genotype in PRP (<xref rid="tbl5 tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 5 and 6</xref>), suggesting that platelet receptor polymorphisms do not have a broad influence on <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet aggregation. Notably, percentage platelet aggregation did not vary with platelet receptor genotype for the pharmacological agonists ADP and SFLLRN–NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="tbl5 tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 5 and 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to investigate the possibility that differences in plasma protein and IgG concentration could influence sensitivity to platelet aggregation <xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>, platelet aggregometry was repeated with washed platelets isolated from 31 healthy volunteers (52% male, 33 ± 9 y) selected on the basis of their platelet receptor genotype (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no significant correlations between platelet receptor genotype and aggregation of washed platelets induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and pharmacological agonists (<xref rid="tbl5 tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 5 and 6</xref>), implying that the small number of significant associations observed for specific bacterial agonists in PRP may have been due to differences in plasma protein concentrations in human volunteers.</p>
        <p>Finally, in order to determine whether the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R polymorphisms influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet adhesion or activation distinct from aggregation, flow cytometry was performed using blood from the same 31 representative individuals used for washed platelet aggregation analysis (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We discovered that GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype did not influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet binding or <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet activation (<xref rid="tbl5 tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 5 and 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies have identified associations between platelet receptor polymorphisms and susceptibility to vascular and immune disease <xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[15,16,19,20]</xref>. This is the first study to investigate the association between platelet receptor genotype, <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions and clinical outcome in infective endocarditis. Overall, our data suggest that the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R platelet receptor polymorphisms do not have a major influence on S<italic>. aureus</italic>–platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation in vitro or prognosis in infective endocarditis.</p>
      <p>The GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R platelet receptor polymorphisms did not influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet adhesion or activation in vitro. However, highly variable strain-dependent effects on <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet aggregation were observed, highlighting the dynamic interaction between host and pathogen that may influence the outcome of infection <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Considerable differences in the capacity to induce platelet aggregation exist among <italic>S. aureus</italic> clinical isolates, likely reflecting variation in MSCRAMM expression <xref rid="bib23 bib25 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[23,25,31]</xref>. For example, strain 209 induced more rapid platelet aggregation in the exponential phase compared to the stationary phase of growth, while the converse was true for strain Newman (<xref rid="tbl5 tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 5 and 6</xref>). This is consistent with our knowledge of the predominant role of fibronectin-binding proteins (Fnbps), in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet aggregation during the exponential phase of growth, as strain 209 adhered strongly to fibronectin whereas strain Newman does not express functional Fnbps and binds fibronectin weakly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, strain 207 did not induce rapid platelet aggregation in exponential phase, consistent with its complete lack of fibronectin-binding activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the stationary phase of growth, the fibrinogen-binding protein clumping factor A (ClfA) is regarded as the predominant surface protein involved in platelet aggregation <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, strains 207 and 209 had long lag times to platelet aggregation in stationary phase, in spite of their capacity to bind to fibrinogen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), but both strains demonstrated lower adherence compared to strain Newman, possibly reflecting lower levels of expression of ClfA on the bacterial cell surface.</p>
      <p>The associations between GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype and <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced platelet aggregation in PRP were lost when washed platelets were used, suggesting that variation in the concentration of immunoglobulins or plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin or von Willebrand factor may have influenced our results <xref rid="bib11 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[11,29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our data are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated a lack of effect of the FcγRIIa H131R genotype on shear-induced platelet activation and platelet aggregation induced by both pharmacological agonists and streptococci <xref rid="bib18 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[18,30]</xref>. However, our observations contrast with those of large studies that have demonstrated increased platelet activation and aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine in Pl<sup>A2</sup> carriers. This may be due to the use of bacterial agonists and saturating concentrations of pharmacological agonists in the current study, and the paucity of subjects carrying the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A2/A2</sup> genotype <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Consistent with our in vitro experiments and large studies that have examined the role of platelet receptor polymorphisms in thrombosis, immune disease and intravascular device infection, GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R genotype did not influence the development of infective endocarditis, vegetation characteristics or the composite clinical end-point of embolism, heart failure, need for surgery or mortality <xref rid="bib16 bib34 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[16,34–36]</xref>. Notably, the demographics of our infective endocarditis study population were similar to those observed in large multi-center published studies <xref rid="bib2 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[2,37]</xref>, but rates of staphylococcal endocarditis and vegetation formation were lower than expected, possibly due to a reduced prevalence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in comparison to the USA <xref rid="bib2 bib4 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[2,4,37]</xref>. Rates of heart failure, embolism and mortality were comparable to other published research, while rates of surgery were higher than reported by Murdoch et al., most likely attributable to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary being a tertiary referral center for cardiothoracic surgery <xref rid="bib2 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[2,38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast to our in vitro analysis, we identified increased platelet activation in patients with infective endocarditis homozygous for the Pl<sup>A1</sup> allele, suggesting that the Pl<sup>A1/A1</sup> genotype may influence bacterium–platelet interactions in vivo. However, an effect of the differing demographics of our study populations, which included predominantly older male infective endocarditis patients and a cohort of mostly younger female healthy volunteers, cannot be ruled out, particularly as it is known that platelet activation increases with age and in female subjects <xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[39,40]</xref>. It is also possible that the low shear environment encountered during platelet aggregometry in vitro, in contrast to the high shear environment in vivo, may influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, it is possible that the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in human blood in vivo, as opposed to nutrient-rich culture medium in vitro, may influence the expression of MSCRAMMs implicated in bacterium-induced platelet activation <xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">[42,43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, it is important to note that the current study had a modest patient population size, particularly with regards to the Pl<sup>A2/A2</sup> genotype. A larger study would also enable correction for possible confounding factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, antibiotic treatment, platelet receptor density, source of infection and underlying cardiac and bacteremic risk factors for infective endocarditis <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In particular, correction for pathogen-related factors such as route of acquisition and bacterial species would be desirable. Nevertheless, the combination of approaches employed here, including the analysis of samples from well-defined clinical cases of infective endocarditis and in vitro platelet functional analyses, strongly suggest that the GPIIIa Pl<sup>A1/A2</sup> and FcγRIIa H131R platelet receptor polymorphisms do not influence <italic>S. aureus</italic>–platelet interactions in vitro and do not constitute risk factors for infective endocarditis.</p>
