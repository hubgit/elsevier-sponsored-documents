          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation plays an important role in the development of postangioplasty or in-stent restenosis, venous graft failure, and atherosclerosis. Our previous work has demonstrated S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2), an F-box subunit of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase, as an important mediator and common final pathway for growth factors, extracellular matrices, and cyclic-nucleotides to regulate VSMC proliferation in vitro. However, whether alteration of Skp2 function also regulates VSMC proliferation in vivo and neointimal thickening postvascular injury remains unclear. We investigated the effect of Skp2 on VSMC proliferation and neointimal formation in vivo.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Results</title>
          <p>Firstly, we demonstrated that Skp2-null mice developed significantly smaller neointimal areas than wild-type mice after carotid ligation. Secondly, to further identify a local rather than a systemic effect of Skp2 alteration, we demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative Skp2 in the balloon-injured rat carotid artery significantly increased medial p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels, inhibited VSMC proliferation, and the subsequent neointimal thickening. Lastly, to determine if Skp2 alone is sufficient to drive VSMC proliferation and lesion development in vivo, we demonstrated that adenovirus-delivery of wild-type Skp2 to the minimally-injured rat carotids is sufficient to downregulate p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein levels, enhanced medial VSMC proliferation, and the neointimal thickening.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This data provides, we believe for the first time, a more comprehensive understanding of Skp2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and neointimal formation and suggests that Skp2 is a promising target in the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases.</p>

        <title>Clinical Relevance</title>
        <p>This manuscript describes our latest work investigating the role of the Skp2, an F-box protein component of the SCF<sup>skp2</sup> ubiquitin-ligase, in promoting VSMC proliferation, and neointima formation in response to vascular injury in vivo. Our previous work has identified a major role for Skp2 as a key target for numerous positive and negative growth regulatory signals in vitro. These signals converge to regulate the expression of Skp2, which then controls cell-cycle progression by promoting degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Until now, there has been no data in the literature on the role played by Skp2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and neointima formation in vivo. Our current manuscript describes, we believe for the first time, the important role played by Skp2 in these processes, using both mouse and rat arterial injury models. This is important because proliferation of VSMCs underlies the development of postangioplasty or post-stenting restenosis, venous graft failure, and transplant arteriosclerosis. Our work demonstrates for the first time that Skp2 is a major regulator of VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening in vivo in response to vascular injury and highlights Skp2 as a potential target for future strategies designed to combat vasculoproliferative diseases.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is rare in normal adult arteries but increases during atherosclerosis. The resulting fibrous cap is vital in protecting the plaque from rupture and subsequent myocardial infarction. On the other hand, excessive VSMC proliferation underlies the development of postangioplasty or post-stenting restenosis, venous graft failure, and transplant arteriosclerosis. Tight regulation of VSMC proliferation is therefore essential. Although a myriad of factors are able to regulate VSMC proliferation, cell-cycle activation is the final common pathway,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and targeting cell-cycle regulation has emerged as a promising strategy in the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases.</p>
    <p>Progression through the G1 phase of the cell-cycle is regulated by phosphorylation and inactivation of retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins. This is promoted by the cyclins (cyclin A, D, and E), which associate with and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6). These CDK:cyclin complexes are subject to negative regulation by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), such as the Cip/Kip family of CDKIs (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>). Downregulation of CDKIs during late G1 after addition of growth factors in vitro or balloon injury in vivo is a critical step in allowing activation of cyclin:CDK complexes and subsequent G1/S phase transition.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Skp2 is an F-box component of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase, implicated in the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of many cell-cycle regulators,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> including p27<sup>Kip1</sup>.<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,6</sup></xref> Although many cell-cycle proteins are potential substrates of Skp2, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is considered most important,<xref rid="bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8</sup></xref> because it accumulates in Skp2-null cells and the phenotypic and histologic abnormalities in Skp2-null mice are almost completely reversed in Skp2/p27<sup>Kip1</sup> doubly-null mice.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
    <p>Increased Skp2 expression along with the related p27<sup>Kip1</sup> deregulation has been deemed a marker of poor prognosis in cancer disease.<xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,10</sup></xref> However, the role of Skp2 in vascular disease is less well established. Our previous work demonstrated that isolated VSMC in culture express high levels of Skp2. Silencing of Skp2 in these cells with siRNA or adenovirus-mediated over-expression of dominant-negative Skp2 (DN-Skp2), increases p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels, and inhibits VSMC proliferation, consistent with an essential role for Skp2.<xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> Moreover, both positive (eg, growth factors and matrix contact) and negative (eg, cyclic-nucleotides) factors for VSMC growth also regulate Skp2 expression in a way reflecting their effects on VSMC proliferation in vitro.<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10-12</sup></xref> Despite this, evidence that Skp2 regulates VSMC proliferation in vivo remains indirect. For example, we showed that elevation of 3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury suppresses Skp2 expression, increases p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels, and inhibits both VSMC proliferation and neointima formation.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Over-expression of a dominant-negative form of the Rac<sub>1</sub> GTPase in the same model showed the same association between decreased Skp2 and increased p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels with suppression of VSMC proliferation.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In the present study, we sought for the first time to provide direct evidence that Skp2 expression regulates VSMC proliferation in vivo sufficiently to affect the final neointimal thickening.</p>

        <p>Balloon injury of left common carotid artery was performed as described by Clowes et al.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Briefly, male SD rats (∼400 grams) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The bifurcation of the left common carotid artery was surgically exposed, and a 2F arterial embolectomy balloon catheter (Edwards Lifesciences Co, Irvine, Calif) was introduced through an arteriotomy on left external carotid artery. The balloon was inflated with saline and pulled back with rotation through common carotid artery three times. The injured common carotid arteries were then subjected to adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. For cell proliferation assay, animals were injected subcutaneously with BrdU solution (25 mg/kg) at 17, 9, and 1 hour before euthanasia.</p>

        <p>Recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses encoding wild-type Skp2 (Ad:WT-Skp2), dominant-negative Skp2 (Ad:DN-Skp2), and β-galactosidase (Ad:βGal) have been described previously.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> To infect rat common carotid artery with adenoviruses for gene expression, both proximal end of common carotid artery and internal carotid artery were temporarily clamped and an aliquot (100 μl) of adenovirus (1 × 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mL)/PBS solution was infused into the filament- or balloon-injured common carotid artery through the external carotid artery. Heparin (500 IU/kg) was given intraperitoneally to prevent arterial thrombosis. The adenoviral solution was retained in the vessel for 30 minutes and then withdrawn. After ligation of external carotid artery, the clamps were removed and the blood flow was restored. The infection rate using this protocol was ∼40% of medial smooth muscle cells according to the extent of β-galactosidase expression (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title>
        <p>Rat carotid arteries were perfused fixed in formalin and cut into ∼0.3-cm-long pieces (three pieces per artery) before being embedded in paraffin wax. Each paraffin block containing three pieces of the same carotid artery was cut into 4-μm-thick sections so that each section had three arterial rings representing arterial lesion 0.3 cm apart in the actual artery. For analysis of cell proliferation (BrdU) and cell-cycle regulators (hyperphosphorylated Rb, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, and Skp2), all cells in each arterial ring (∼300-450 cells per ring) were counted and three arterial rings were analyzed for each carotid artery. The number of positive cells was expressed as a percentage of total cell number calculated by counting hematoxylin counterstained nuclei.</p>
        <p>Cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method using DNA Fragmentation Kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, arterial sections were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) end-labeling cocktail containing TdT, biotin-dUTP, and TdT buffer. The DNase I (0.375 Kunitz unit/μl) treated arterial rings were served as positive control. The arterial rings were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated avidin. Total cell nuclei visualized by Hoescht 33258 and nuclei containing cleaved DNA (FITC-labeled) cells were counted.</p>
        <p>For the evaluation of neointimal thickening, arterial sections were subjected to H&amp;E staining, followed by neointimal (the tissue within the ring of internal elastic lamina) and medial areas measured using Image Pro software system (MediaCybernetics).

      <p>To demonstrate the overall effect of Skp2 gene deletion on the neointimal thickening, Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> and Skp2<sup>+/+</sup> mice were subjected to common carotid arterial ligation, which induces arterial remodeling, VSMC proliferation, and neointimal thickening.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Compared with wild-type Skp2 mice (n = 11), Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 8) developed significantly smaller neointimal areas (130,371 ± 29,054 vs 52,903 ± 35,291 μm<sup>2</sup>; Mann-Whitney test, <italic>P</italic> = .026) 28 days after common carotid ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, vessel diameter (309.5 ± 19.5 μm vs 384.8 ± 40.6 μm, <italic>P</italic> = .086 for wild-type and Skp2-null, respectively) and medial wall thickness (40.6 ± 2.1 μm vs 41.0 ± 2.2 μm, <italic>P</italic> = .9) was not significantly different between wild-type and Skp2-null mice.</p>
      <p>Further mechanistic studies in the mouse model were impossible because of the small number of longitudinal sections that could be cut from each lesion and the difficulties of breeding additional Skp2-null mice due to low fertility and fecundity. To more specifically elucidate the local effect of Skp2 on VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening, and to probe more deeply into the mechanisms, we used adenovirus-mediated delivery of either wild-type Skp2 or DN-Skp2 in balloon- or filament-injured rat carotid arteries, respectively. DN-Skp2 is an F-box-deleted Skp2 mutant, which preserves substrate-binding ability but loses its ability to form SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> complex, and, therefore, inhibits Skp2 function by competing with endogenous Skp2.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> To test whether local inhibition of Skp2 function also reduces VSMC proliferation in vivo, DN-Skp2 was expressed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries using an adenoviral vector. The DN-Skp2 expression significantly enhanced medial VSMC p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression (from 15.7 ± 1.3% to 24.1 ± 2.5% of medial VSMC, <italic>P</italic> = .012, n = 6 and 5, respectively) but not p21<sup>Cip1</sup> expression (from 20.5 ± 3.2% to 30.2 ± 3.9% of medial VSMC, <italic>P</italic> = .08). DN-Skp2 also inhibited VSMC proliferation measured as BrdU index (from 37.3 ± 2.5% to 17.0 ± 3.2%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, n = 6 and 5, respectively) and hyper-phosphorylation of Rb protein (from 43.5 ± 4.5% to 25.9 ± 2.8% of medial VSMC, <italic>P</italic> = .012), a marker of G1-S phase transition, 4 days after injury, compared with vessels infected with a β-galactosidase expressing control adenovirus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, subsequent neointimal thickening 14 days postinjury was also significantly reduced by DN-Skp2 (I/M ratios, from 1.58 ± 0.20 to 0.49 ± 0.21, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, n = 5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Importantly, frequency of apoptosis, detected by TUNEL staining (<xref rid="sec7" ref-type="sec">Fig E1, online only</xref>), was not increased by expression of dominant-negative Skp2 (less than 0.15% in both Ad: βGal and Ad:DN-Skp2-infected vessels). This data demonstrates that Skp2 activity is required for maximal VSMC proliferation and neointimal lesion development in vivo.</p>
      <p>We next sought to determine if increased Skp2 activity alone, in the absence of a large medial injury inflicted by balloon angioplasty, can induce VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening in vivo. To this end, we used adenoviral-delivery of wild-type Skp2 to carotids subjected to filament de-endothelialization. Unlike balloon injury, filament de-endothelialization results in minor medial injury, minimal VSMC proliferation, and thus, a limited thickness of neointima.<xref rid="bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,19</sup></xref> Compared with filament-injured carotids infected with control adenovirus (Ad:βGal), those infected with wild-type Skp2 adenovirus (Ad:WT-Skp2) had substantially increased Skp2 expression (5 ± 1% compared to 43 ± 5% of medial VSMC, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), accompanied by reduced expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (from 18.4 ± 5.4% to 0.6 ± 0.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .016, n = 4 and 6, respectively) but not p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (from 25.8 ± 4.8 to 18.0 ± 2.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .26). Wild-type Skp2 also enhanced VSMC proliferation measured by BrdU incorporation (6 ± 2% to 32 ± 5%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, n = 4 and 6, respectively) and hyper-phosphorylation of Rb (from 9.5 ± 2.1% to 28.3 ± 5.5%, <italic>P</italic> = .015) 4 days after injury (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Eight days after filament injury, Ad:WT-Skp2-infected carotids gave rise to significantly higher I/M ratios than those infected with Ad:βGal (0.11 ± 0.03 compared to 0.42 ± 0.09, <italic>P</italic> = .024, n = 4 and 5, respectively) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although the role of Skp2 in the oncogenesis is well recognized,<xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> its role in the regulation of VSMC proliferation is less established. The current studies directly demonstrate for the first time that Skp2 function is involved in injury-induced VSMC proliferation and neointima development in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Skp2 over-expression is sufficient to drive both proliferation and lesion development after endothelial denudation in the absence of major medial injury. These experiments implicate Skp2 as a novel target for the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases, such as vascular restenosis after percutaneous vascular intervention.</p>
      <p>Numerous factors, such as growth factors, inflammatory mediators, extracellular matrix attachment, cell-cell contact, and cyclic nucleotides are involved in the regulation of VSMC proliferation.<xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22-24</sup></xref> Nevertheless, the cell-cycle is the final machinery to integrate and orchestrate intricate upstream signals to delicately tune VSMC proliferation.<xref rid="bib1 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,25</sup></xref> Recent encouraging clinical reports show that stents coated with rapamycin or paclitaxel, which target G1-S or G2-M transition, respectively, prevent the occurrence of restenosis after coronary intervention.<xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> This strongly supports the notion that the cell-cycle, the common final pathway for VSMC proliferation, is an ideal target for the treatment of vascular restenosis and, by implication, other vasculoproliferative diseases.</p>
      <p>Our previous studies established Skp2 as an important mediator in the final common pathway for VSMC proliferation in vitro.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> For example, we showed that positive mediators for VSMC proliferation (growth factors and matrix contact) increase Skp2 levels, whereas negative regulators (cyclic nucleotides) decrease them.<xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> These effects are mediated through regulation of focal adhesion kinase,<xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref> phosphoinositide 3-kinase,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and Rac<sub>1</sub><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> signaling pathways. DN-Skp2 blocks the stimulation of VSMC proliferation after growth factor addition, whereas overexpression of native Skp2 reverses the inhibitory effects of cyclic-nucleotides.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In vivo we also demonstrated that Skp2 expression levels are strikingly enhanced after balloon injury with a time course that perfectly mirrors that of VSMC proliferation.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Moreover, adventitial application of forskolin (an activator of endogenous cyclic AMP levels) inhibited Skp2 expression, VSMC proliferation, and neointima formation. This indirect evidence supports the role of Skp2 in VSMC proliferation in vivo. Justified by this correlative evidence, we directly tested for the first time whether Skp2 is necessary and sufficient for VSMC proliferation and neointima formation in vivo after vascular injury in mice and rats. Initially, we demonstrated that neointima formation after carotid ligation was significantly attenuated in Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, compared with that in Skp2<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Although Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> mice tend to be smaller than their wild-type counterparts<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> we found that carotid diameter and medial thickness was not different and no gross vessel abnormalities were observed at the time of surgery. Impaired lesion formation in these mice is consistent with previous reports of reduced rates of cellular proliferation.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> It is important to note that impaired lesion formation in Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> mice could be explained in part by actions of Skp2 in other cells, such as bone marrow progenitor cells, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, all of which may interact with VSMC and contribute significantly to the final neointimal thickening.<xref rid="bib29 bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29-31</sup></xref> To more specifically pinpoint the effects of Skp2 inhibition on local VSMC and neointimal thickening, DN-Skp2 was expressed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The expression of DN-Skp2 resulted in elevated levels of the CDKI p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, which is normally rapidly downregulated soon after vascular injury.<xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref> These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that injury-induced expression of Skp2 is responsible for the downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> after vascular injury. Downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is thought to be an important step in removing the brake on proliferation, because forced expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> inhibits S-phase entry and neointima formation after balloon injury<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>-null mice display a hyper-proliferative phenotype and exaggerated responses to vascular injury. We showed here that expression of DN-Skp2 prevented downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and resulted in significantly reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb protein, a marker of G1-S transition, reduced rates of VSMC proliferation and smaller neointimal lesions. Expression of DN-Skp2 did not, however, significantly effect the expression of p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, even though our previous data demonstrated that Skp2 regulates p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels in VSMC in vitro.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, p21<sup>Cip1</sup> regulation seems to be more complicated than that of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in these cells. The p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels actually increase in response to mitogen stimulation, coordinately with increases in Skp2, which functions to maintain p21<sup>Cip1</sup> within growth permissive levels.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> This complex pattern of regulation may account for the lack of a significant change in p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in this study. Importantly, apoptosis rates were not increased in vessels expressing DN-Skp2, indicating that reduced lesion formation was due to inhibition of proliferation rather than increased cell death. Likewise, expression of DN-Skp2 in VSMC in vitro does not result in increased rate of apoptosis (unpublished data). Taken together with our observations from Skp2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, our data demonstrates that injury-induced expression of Skp2 is a major mechanism regulating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels and is essential for VSMC proliferation and the final neointimal thickening.</p>
      <p>We previously demonstrated that exogenous expression of Skp2 is able to force VSMC to enter S-phase in the uninjured rat aorta in organ cultures.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the present study, we asked whether increased Skp2 expression would be sufficient to induce VSMC proliferation and neointimal lesion development, in the absence of major medial injury in vivo. Consistent with previous reports,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we showed that filament de-endothelialization of rat carotid artery caused minimal levels of VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening, and only a small increase in Skp2 expression. However, forced expression of wild-type Skp2 resulted in a remarkable reduction of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression and a transmedial increase of BrdU-labeled cells. This demonstrates that Skp2 alone is sufficient to promote p27<sup>Kip1</sup> downregulation and VSMC proliferation in the absence of major medial injury.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our data provides the first direct and robust evidence that Skp2 plays an important role in promoting VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening in vivo in response to vascular injury. These results suggest that Skp2 may represent an attractive target for future gene or pharmacologic-based therapies to combat vasculoproliferative diseases. Targeting Skp2 in this way may be more effective than approaches designed to block the activity of single downstream cell-cycle regulators, such as p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, because Skp2 regulates the levels and activity of multiple cell-cycle proteins. However, more work is required to elucidate the role and regulation of Skp2 in other vascular cells, particularly endothelial cells, before this may become a reality.</p>
