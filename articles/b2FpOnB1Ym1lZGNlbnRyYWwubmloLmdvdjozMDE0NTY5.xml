      <abstract>
        <p>Protein kinases provide a platform for the integration of signal transduction networks. A key feature of transmitting these cellular signals is the ability of protein kinases to activate one another by phosphorylation. A number of kinases are predicted by sequence homology to be incapable of phosphoryl group transfer due to degradation of their catalytic motifs. These are termed pseudokinases and because of the assumed lack of phosphoryltransfer activity their biological role in cellular transduction has been mysterious. Recent structure–function studies have uncovered the molecular determinants for protein kinase inactivity and have shed light to the biological functions and evolution of this enigmatic subset of the human kinome. Pseudokinases act as signal transducers by bringing together components of signalling networks, as well as allosteric activators of active protein kinases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein kinases are involved in orchestrating almost all aspects of cellular life by integrating cell signalling networks. A myriad of studies have described the molecular basis of protein kinase function. The first structure of a protein kinase, described by Knighton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991 uncovered the architecture of the eukaryotic protein kinase domain and key elements of the enzyme Protein Kinase A (PKA) catalytic site together with the substrate binding mode [<xref rid="bib0005 bib0010" ref-type="bibr">1,2</xref>]. Several structural and sequence homology studies of protein kinase domains have revealed a consensus of what are the common motifs that are required for catalytic activity [<xref rid="bib0015 bib0020 bib0025 bib0030 bib0035 bib0040 bib0045" ref-type="bibr">3,4,5<sup>•</sup>,6<sup>•</sup>,7<sup>•</sup>,8,9</xref>] (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a and b). These comprise residues that are required for nucleotide (ATP) binding, metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) binding and residues required for phosphoryl group transfer. There are 518 known human protein kinases [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10<sup>••</sup></xref>], representing approximately 2–2.5% of the estimated total number of genes in the human genome [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the third most common functional domain [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Intriguingly, ∼10% of the kinome appear to lack at least one of the motifs required for catalysis and have been termed pseudokinases [<xref rid="bib0050 bib0065" ref-type="bibr">10<sup>••</sup>,13<sup>••</sup></xref>].</p>

      <title>Inactive pseudokinases or simply unusual active kinases?</title>
      <p>The subject of pseudokinases has generated much attention recently [<xref rid="bib0070 bib0075 bib0080 bib0085" ref-type="bibr">14–17</xref>] and remains controversial. For some proteins that were observed to lack catalytic residues and were thus originally classified as pseudokinases, protein kinase activity was subsequently reported. One of the best examples of this are the WNK (<underline>W</underline>ith <underline>N</underline>o (<underline>K</underline>) Lys) protein kinases that activate SPAK and OSR1 kinases by phosphorylation, contributing to the regulation of ion transport and blood pressure (reviewed by Richardson and Alessi [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Interestingly, the WNK1 crystal structure revealed that although a key Lys residue was missing from the VAIK motif (found in subdomain II of the kinase domain), this was structurally compensated for by a Lys residue present in the neighbouring subdomain I [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar examples of apparent pseudokinases displaying the capacity for phosphoryl transfer have been reported recently (e.g. CASK [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], IRAK2 [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and HER3 [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22<sup>•</sup></xref>]). Because of these recent findings, it appears that using variations in the primary sequences of the catalytic motifs to predict whether a kinase domain has catalytic activity is not always valid. This suggests that the bioinformatics prediction of ∼10% of the kinome being pseudokinases may be an overestimate. Predicted pseudokinases should thus be studied individually, their activity be probed with more direct methods and their structures determined.</p>

      <title>Five ways of killing a kinase</title>
      <p>A number of recent studies have provided structural information of pseudokinase domains that have extended our understanding of their biological functions and the mechanism of their inactivation. We summarise these examples below, thus explaining the molecular determinants for protein kinase inactivity and suggest a new set of criteria for cataloguing the currently predicted pseudokinases (<xref rid="tb0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>STRADα</title>
        <p>The Ste20 related adaptor (STRADα and STRADβ) isoforms are part of the LKB1 heterotrimeric tumour suppressor complex [<xref rid="bib0120 bib0125" ref-type="bibr">24,25</xref>]. Together with the adaptor protein MO25 [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], STRAD activates the LKB1 kinase through an allosteric mechanism that does not require LKB1 activation loop phosphorylation [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27<sup>••</sup></xref>]. STRAD lacks six of the eleven catalytically important residues that are generally required for kinase activity (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). Despite the changes in the glycine-rich loop, (the third consensus glycine being replaced by Met83 (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, c, and d), the crystal structure of STRADα revealed that STRADα is capable of binding ATP with low nanomolar affinity, and retains a kinase fold that that is typical of the canonical ‘active’ kinase conformation [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>••</sup></xref>]. Curiously, all catalytic motifs usually required for kinase activity (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c), adopt conformations compatible with phosphoryl transfer, yet the amino acids on these structural motifs lack the chemical properties required for catalysis (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). For instance, instead of an Asp residue in the conserved Arg-Asp motif (Asp166 in PKA, <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c) that acts as a catalytic base [<xref rid="bib0025 bib0145" ref-type="bibr">5<sup>•</sup>,29</xref>], a Ser residue (Ser195) is present in STRADα (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). Interestingly, the Asp-Phe-Gly motif, crucial for binding Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, is changed to Gly-Leu-Arg in STRADα. The Arg215 side chain coordinates the β-phosphate group of ATP and together with His200 they partially substitute the role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c and d). The active conformation of STRADα was shown to be modulated by its binding partner MO25, as well as ATP [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>••</sup></xref>]. The MO25 interaction is centered around the regulatory helix αC, which is analogous to the activation of CDKs by cyclins [<xref rid="bib0150 bib0030" ref-type="bibr">30<sup>•</sup>,6<sup>•</sup></xref>]. Loss of ATP and MO25 binding impinges on the ability of STRAD to activate the LKB1 kinase [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>••</sup></xref>], suggesting that the ‘active’ conformation of STRADα plays a key role. When the structure of the full LKB1 heterotrimer became available, it was apparent that elements of the STRADα active and substrate binding sites such as the activation and substrate binding loops [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and helix αG [<xref rid="bib0155 bib0160 bib0165" ref-type="bibr">31<sup>•</sup>,32,33<sup>•</sup></xref>] were involved in binding and activating the LKB1 kinase (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a) [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27<sup>••</sup></xref>]. The activation loop of STRADα adopts an extended conformation, reminiscent of active kinases and is involved in LKB1 binding (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a). These data suggest that STRADα engages LKB1 as a ‘pseudosubstrate’ and explain why STRADα must adopt an active conformation in order to activate LKB1 [<xref rid="bib0135 bib0140 bib0080" ref-type="bibr">27<sup>••</sup>,28<sup>••</sup>,16</xref>]. Therefore, STRADα appears to have evolved as a pseudokinase allosteric regulator of LKB1 no longer requiring the ability to catalyse phosphoryl transfer.</p>

      <sec id="sec0025">
        <title>ILK</title>
        <p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is involved in signalling from the transmembrane integrin receptor to the actin cytoskeleton, and as such regulates many cell-adhesion-dependent processes [<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ILK is part of a heterotrimeric complex together with PINCH and parvin (the so-called IPP complex) [<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although ILK lacks six of the eleven key residues required for catalysis (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a and b), a large number of studies have claimed that ILK phosphorylates several substrates (reviewed by Legate <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006). However, these data contradict reports from genetic studies suggesting that kinase catalytic activity <italic>per se</italic> may not be required for IPP complex function (reviewed by Wickström <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010 [<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is possible that ILK gains activity under very specific conditions (e.g. upon post-translational modification and/or allosteric activators), which may explain these contradictory reports. A recent crystal structure of ILK bound to α-Parvin [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36<sup>••</sup></xref>] has uncovered the molecular basis of ILK function and explains why ILK is incapable of phosphorylating any substrates (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e). Inactivity is accounted for by substitutions of the catalytic base (PKA residue Asp166) with Ala319, the crucial lysine residue from the catalytic loop (PKA residue Lys168) with Asn321 and a Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding Asn residue (PKA residue Asn171) with Ser324 (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c and e). A striking feature of the ILK-α-parvin complex structure is the presence of ATP in the ILK nucleotide binding pocket, despite several non-conservative substitutions of crucial glycine residues in the glycine-rich loop (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a and e). The ATP γ-phosphate is also coordinated by a positively charged residue (Lys341), acquired by a substitution of the conserved glycine from the canonical DFG motif (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e), similar to the interaction between Arg215 of STRADα and the ATP γ-phosphate (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). While it is unclear what the function of ATP binding in ILK is, one possible function is that ATP is required for the active-like conformational state of ILK to bind parvin molecules. Binding of parvins was wrongly assumed to activate ILK, as the recent structure by Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic> revealed that α-parvin makes use of the active site of ILK for binding [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36<sup>••</sup></xref>]. Thus, α-parvin bound to the ILK pseudoactive site will sterically hinder any potential substrates of the ILK-α-parvin complex (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). This is similar to the binding mode of STRAD and LKB1, where the pseudokinase (STRAD) makes use of its pseudoactive site and binds its partner (LKB1) as a pseudosubstrate (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a). Thus, structures of the ILK-α-parvin complex and the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex show a recognition mode between pseudokinases with their macromolecular partners that is similar to the known kinase–substrate interactions. Further examples of this will need to be uncovered to establish this as a general mechanism of interaction.</p>

        <title>HER3</title>
        <p>HER3/ErbB3 is a member of the human epidermal growth family (HER) of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes HER1/ErbB1, HER2/ErbB2 and HER4/ErbB4. Of the four members, HER3 is classified as a pseudokinase because it lacks two of the eleven residues important for catalysis (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, b and f). Upon ligand binding to the EGF receptor, the intracellular kinase domains undergo homodimerisation and heterodimerisation resulting in the formation of active asymmetric dimers (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c) [<xref rid="bib0185 bib0190" ref-type="bibr">37<sup>••</sup>,38</xref>]. The asymmetric dimers involve a kinase active component named ‘the receiver’ and ‘the activator’ kinase (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). The activator binds via its C-lobe to the αC helix (N-lobe) of ‘the receiver’, thus activating ‘the receiver’ kinase in a manner that is reminiscent to the CDK2/cyclin mode of activation (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). Curiously, residues involved in both ‘activator’ and ‘receiver’ interfaces (both N-lobe and C-lobe) are conserved among all active kinases HER1, 2 and 4 [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39<sup>•</sup></xref>], suggesting that these can act as both ‘activators’ and ‘receivers’. By contrast, only the C-lobe residues that are involved in the role of the ‘activator’ are conserved in HER3 [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39<sup>•</sup></xref>]. This suggests that the HER3 pseudokinase is an allosteric activator of ‘the receiver’ rather than catalyzing phosphoryltransfer (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c). Consistent with this, a recently published study of HER3 also revealed that the HER3 kinase domain attains a conformation common to inactive protein kinases [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39<sup>•</sup></xref>]. In addition, constructs comprising the tyrosine kinase domain and the intracellular kinase domain (ICD) are incapable of phosphoryltransfer [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39<sup>•</sup></xref>]. Intriguingly however, despite the relatively mild substitutions in the catalytic site (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>f), a histidine-tagged HER3–ICD construct was reported to possess catalytic activity in the presence of vesicle lipids attached to NTA-Ni head groups [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22<sup>•</sup></xref>]. This measured HER3 activity is ∼1000 fold less than the active HER1 counterpart [<xref rid="bib0110 bib0085" ref-type="bibr">22<sup>•</sup>,17</xref>] and it remains to be determined whether this trace level of phosphorylation is biologically relevant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec0035">
        <title>VRK3</title>
        <p>VRK3 is a human vaccinia related kinase and lacks catalytic activity owing to the substitution of six out of eleven active site residues (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a and b). The structure of VRK3 explains how non-conservative substitutions of these catalytic motifs compromise VRK3 catalytic competence (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>g) [<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40<sup>••</sup></xref>]. Of detrimental effect to ATP binding and hence catalytic activity, are the substitution of a small glycine residue from the glycine-rich loop (residue Asp175) and residue Gln177 that are predicted to clash with the phosphate moiety of ATP, although similar substitutions are tolerated in ILK. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu180, Leu262 and Phe313 now fill the ATP binding pocket and complete the so-called ‘hydrophobic R-spine’ (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>g) [<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Consistent with these structural observations, VRK3 is incapable of binding nucleotides [<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40<sup>••</sup></xref>]. The VRK3 structure is similar to the structure of the closely related active kinase VRK2, although the inability to bind nucleotides renders VRK3 a truly ‘dead’ kinase. Recent studies suggest that VRK3 direct binding inhibits the vaccinia H1-related (VHR) phosphatase, a dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK [<xref rid="bib0210 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">42,43</xref>]. Thus, VRK3 regulates MAP kinase signalling through inhibition of ERK activity, and VRK3 functions may be attributed to its interactions instead of functioning as a protein kinase.</p>

      <sec id="sec0040">
        <title>ROP2 and ROP8</title>
        <p>Two other pseudokinase structures, members of the Rhotropy (ROP) family, ROP2 and ROP8 from the intracellular parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> have been reported recently [<xref rid="bib0220 bib0225" ref-type="bibr">44<sup>••</sup>,45</xref>]. Of the eight members of the ROP family, five are predicted to be pseudokinases, namely ROP2, ROP4, ROP5, ROP7 and ROP8. It is not clear why so many members of the ROP family are pseudokinases, although it is possible that they are examples of evolutionary remnants of gene duplication, given that the genome of these parasites is more amenable to undergo rapid changes. ROP2 and ROP8 lack seven out of eleven conserved residues important for catalysis and are predicted to be inactive (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a and b). The structures of ROP2 and ROP8 adopt similar conformations, with the activation segment in the canonical conformation typical of active protein kinases [<xref rid="bib0220 bib0225" ref-type="bibr">44<sup>••</sup>,45</xref>]. One noticeable difference is the presence of a short insert within the αEF/αF loop, which may also account for specific binding of as yet unidentified macromolecular partners. Unlike VRK3, the ATP pocket is empty in ROP2 and ROP8 structures, and Labesse <italic>et al.</italic> reported that ROP2 does not interact with ATP [<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44<sup>••</sup></xref>]. Non-conservative substitutions from the N-lobe residues Glu275 and Tyr278, (glycine-rich loop) as well as residue Tyr280 (β2) are predicted to clash with a bound ATP molecule (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>h), although the adenine pocket is not completely filled. Curiously, a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is present in the ROP2/8 active site (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>h), and this is coordinated by an acquired Gly442Glu substitution in the conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a). Hence, it is still uncertain whether the nucleotide pocket of ROP pseudokinases harbours a true ATP or other ligand binding site. The catalytic base is also missing and is replaced by Tyr422 (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>h), which further suggests ROP pseudokinases are devoid of catalytic activity. Instead, their role is predicted to be mainly of scaffolding nature.</p>

      <title>Pseudokinases regulated by nucleotide binding</title>
      <p>The link between nucleotide pocket occupancy of a kinase/pseudokinase domain and its conformation has not been fully appreciated, despite potential functional implications and examples in other classes of enzymes that bind nucleotides (e.g. G-proteins are regulated by guanine nucleotide-induced conformational changes). Pseudokinases like STRADα and HER3 bind ATP with low nanomolar affinity [<xref rid="bib0140 bib0110" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>••</sup>,22<sup>•</sup></xref>]. Structural, biophysical and mutagenesis data demonstrate the importance of nucleotide binding to STRADα in influencing STRADα’s ability to interact with its biological partners (LKB1 and MO25), as well as the ability of STRADα to activate the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase [<xref rid="bib0140 bib0135" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>••</sup>,27<sup>••</sup></xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, conformational regulation of a kinase domain through nucleotide pocket occupancy has also been described for catalytically active kinases. For instance in the case of IRE1 (Inositol-requiring enzyme 1), its phosphoryl transfer activity is functionally dispensable [<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Instead, the nucleotide binding event serves to promote dimerisation that in turn composes a ribonuclease active site elsewhere on the protein. The kinase domain dimerisation occurs mainly through the N-lobe, including helix αC, and does not involve the activation segment [<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The authors suggest, that the predicted pseudokinase RNaseL that is closely related to IRE1 but lacks its activation segment and hence phosphotransfer activity altogether, would similarly use nucleotide binding to promote RNaseL dimerisation and ribonuclease function [<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
      <p>Another prominent example of a pseudokinase influenced by ATP binding is the family of receptor guanylyl cyclases (RGC), that produce the second messenger cGMP in response to the binding of several natriuretic factors (reviewed in [<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). These lack the HRD motif that provides the catalytic base residue, although ANP-RGC receptors are able to bind ATP leading to further amplification of receptor activity. It is thought that both activity of the guanyl cyclase domain, C-terminal to the pseudokinase domain, as well as receptor ligand affinity are influenced by ATP binding [<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The ATP-dependent activity of the receptor is not affected when non-hydrolysable forms of ATP (e.g. ATP-γ-S) are used, and is sensitive to point mutations in the glycine-rich loop and VAIK motifs that affect ATP interaction with the pseudokinase domain [<xref rid="bib0245 bib0235" ref-type="bibr">49,47</xref>]. Moreover, Jaleel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006 raised a monoclonal antibody that recognises the pseudokinase domain of guanylyl cyclase receptor 2C (GC-C) and showed that the immunoreactivity was compromised upon ATP binding, suggesting large conformational shifts between the ATP bound/unbound forms of this domain [<xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Fine epitope mapping revealed the epitope to be the region around the VAIK motif. In the absence of structural data, it is difficult to envisage the exact conformational changes that would occur owing to GC-C ATP binding. In the majority of kinases the VAIK motif (β3) is followed by helix αC, a well known region that undergoes large conformational changes upon formation of the conserved Lys(β3)/Glu(αC) ion bridge [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6<sup>•</sup></xref>]. Future studies in this area may demonstrate that the active/inactive conformations of the pseudokinase domain are indeed required for RGC activity via a regulatory mechanism that involves nucleotide binding.</p>

        <title>EGF and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases</title>
        <p>Interestingly, there are a number of membrane receptors that contain a predicted cytoplasmic pseudokinase domain, including members of the ephrin receptor EphB6 and EphB10 as well as members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family ErbB3/Her3. As already discussed above the four members of the EGF receptor kinases (ErbB1–4) are envisaged to trans-activate by forming so-called asymmetric heterodimers, upon ligand binding rather than phosphorylation [<xref rid="bib0185 bib0190" ref-type="bibr">37<sup>••</sup>,38</xref>]. This lack of evolutionary pressure to conserve phosphoryl transfer activity, owing to the presence of multiple <italic>ErbB</italic> genes coupled by the allosteric mechanism of activation rather than phosphorylation, may be the cause for the loss of catalytic activity of ErbB3. It is possible that other pseudokinases have also evolved in a similar way. Given the proximity to the EGF receptor tyrosine kinases in the human kinome, EphB6 and EphB10 may be regulating the active members of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family by using an as yet to be determined, analogous trans-activation mechanism to ErbB3.</p>

        <title>KSR</title>
        <p>Another example where a pseudokinase forms complexes with active kinases are members of the kinase suppressor of Ras 1 and 2 (KSR1/2), that are essential for Ras induced activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK module in MAP kinase signalling. These predicted pseudokinases act as scaffolds bringing together the three components of the MAP kinase pathway (MAPKKK, MAPKK and MAPK), thus regulating signalling output and potentiation [<xref rid="bib0255 bib0260 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">51–53</xref>]. The role of scaffold proteins in MAP kinase signalling is well studied in budding yeast and the importance of Ste5p adaptor protein for bringing together the MAPK components module is well established [<xref rid="bib0270 bib0275 bib0280" ref-type="bibr">54–56</xref>]. It appears the Ste5p scaffolding roles for MAP kinases in yeast, have been substituted by KSR1 and KSR2 in higher eukaryotes [<xref rid="bib0285 bib0255" ref-type="bibr">57,51</xref>]. The pseudokinase domain of KSR1 binds MEK and RAF, whereas ERK is recruited to the signalling complex via a conserved domain N-terminal to the pseudokinase domain [<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, recent work that established KSR2 as an important scaffold (similar to KSR1) of MAP kinase signalling, reveals KSR2 can be regulated by dephosphorylation by calcineurin in response to changing Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels [<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The lack of structural information makes it difficult to precisely understand the mechanism by which KSR1/2 contribute to these scaffolding complexes, and what conformation the KSR pseudokinase domain attains when acting as a scaffold. It will be interesting however to investigate ligand (ATP) binding capabilities of KSR1/2 and see if this is required for MAP kinase signalling, and whether an active conformation is required for KSR binding of macromolecular partners.</p>
        <p>A prominent finding that suggests KSR may have functions beyond the scaffolding component, came from the recent revelation that RAF kinase domains form homodimers and heterodimers resulting in activated RAF kinase [<xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58<sup>••</sup></xref>] (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d). This side-to-side dimerisation interface engages a region in close proximity to the regulatory helix αC and is required for RAF activation (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d). The residues involved in the dimer interface are also conserved in KSR, and Rajakulendran <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrate that KSR can function as an allosteric activator of RAF, without the requirement for KSR phosphoryltransfer activity [<xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58<sup>••</sup></xref>].</p>

        <title>JAKs</title>
        <p>Perhaps the most studied pseudokinase domain belongs to the members of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) family. The JAK isoforms include JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 all of which contain an N-terminal pseudokinase domain (JH2) followed by a kinase domain (JH1). This characteristic feature of containing two kinase domains gives JAKs their name, referring to the two-faced Roman god Janus. JAKs respond upon receptor binding to cytokines and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic region of these cytokine receptors, thus creating sites of interaction for downstream signalling molecules. The pseudokinase domain is required for JAK2 auto-inhibition and is essential for JAK2 cytokine activation [<xref rid="bib0295 bib0300" ref-type="bibr">59,60</xref>]. A gain-of-function mutation (Val617Phe) in the JAK2 JH2 domain is a cause of myeloproliferative disorders in humans [<xref rid="bib0305 bib0310 bib0315" ref-type="bibr">61–63</xref>]. Structural modelling and biochemical data suggest the N-lobe of JH2 domain where Val617 resides is in close proximity to the JH1 domain [<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Recently, gain-of-function somatic mutations of another residue present in the JH2 domain (Arg683Gly/Ser/Lys) were found in 18% of patients suffering with Down's syndrome-associated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [<xref rid="bib0320 bib0325 bib0330" ref-type="bibr">64–66</xref>]. The exact location of these disease causing mutations and how their position relates to the JH1 domain are not known. It will be interesting to see if structural studies of JH1/JH2 domains will reveal the molecular mechanism of action of these mutations, and whether these resemble any of the interactions that have been recently described for other pseudokinase–kinase interactions.</p>

      <title>Evolution of pseudokinases</title>
      <p>How did pseudokinases evolve? In general it is plausible to believe that kinases evolved from ATP binding enzymes, since nucleotide binding must have preceded catalytic function. Therefore it is not surprising that ligand (ATP) binding plays a key regulatory component for pseudokinase/kinase function. As a consequence there are two possibilities—either pseudokinases represent ‘would-be’ active kinases, or they represent kinases that have lost their catalytic activity.</p>
      <p>The first scenario could be true for proteins that are well conserved as pseudokinases throughout eukaryotic kinase evolution such as SCYL1-3 and GCN2. For instance, ATP-binding precursors of yeast SCY1 and GCN2 may have failed to ‘mature’ as active protein kinases capable of phosphoryl transfer. Instead, important non-catalytic functions were conserved throughout evolution for these pseudokinases. In GCN2 this could have been aided by loss of evolutionary pressure for kinase maturation, since another kinase domain is present in the same polypeptide chain.</p>
      <p>However, the reasoning above cannot account for a significant number of pseudokinases that do not have clear pseudokinase homologues in primitive species (e.g. STRADα, KSR1/2, HER3, etc…). Therefore these may have evolved via a different route. One possibility is that pseudokinases have evolved from active kinases once capable of phosphorylating and activating their substrates, but have lost their activity during evolution. The structures of STRADα, ILK and VRK3 show that despite being inactive, these pseudokinases are able to assume an active conformation with a highly organised active site poised for phosphoryl transfer. In addition, the structure of the LKB1 heterotrimer and ILK-α-parvin complex, reveal that STRAD and ILK can bind LKB1 and α-parvin respectively as pseudosubstrates [<xref rid="bib0135 bib0180" ref-type="bibr">27<sup>••</sup>,36<sup>••</sup></xref>]. This suggests that pseudokinases like STRADα and ILK were able to phosphorylate substrates at some stage during evolution, but changed their mechanism to favour regulation through binding, rather than post-translational modification. It is possible that other pseudokinases have evolved from active kinases in similar ways.</p>

      <title>Going ‘pseudo’-loosing the will to catalyse</title>
      <p>The process of using previously catalytically competent domains as scaffolds is plausible from an evolutionary perspective as enzymes have evolved to bind their substrates. This is also observed in other classes of enzymes such as pseudophosphatases [<xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and similar to some pseudokinases, these enzymes lack catalytically important residues and act as scaffolds in signalling complexes. For instance the pseudophosphatase TAB1 is a scaffolding component of the TAK1-TAK2/3-TAB1 signalling complex [<xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, a number of PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatases) are predicted to be inactive [<xref rid="bib0335 bib0345" ref-type="bibr">67,69</xref>]. Examples of predicted pseudophosphatases include STYX [<xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], EGG-4 and EGG-5 [<xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] that are thought to function by binding and ‘trapping’ phosphorylated tyrosine residues instead of phosphate removal. The exact mechanisms of action for these pseudophosphatases are as yet unclear, although engaging phosphotyrosine residues through this ‘substrate trapping’ mechanism will neutralise the effects of phosphorylation, and/or make them inaccessible for signal-transmitting phosphotyrosine binding domains (e.g. SH2 domains) [<xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
      <p>The phenomenon of catalytically inactive members is not restricted to enzyme families involved in protein phosphorylation alone, but extends to other processes of postranslational modifications such as ubiquitinylation. A class of ubiquitin E2 ligases called Uev (ubiquitin E2 variant) domains have the same fold as E2 enzymes but lack certain catalytic residues and are hence devoid of catalytic activity [<xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Similar to the process by which some kinases require pseudokinases for full activity, some E2 enzymes also require their inactive counterparts (Uev domains) for ability to transfer ubiquitin to a substrate (e.g. Uev1a and Ubc13). By analogy to the existence of the pseudokinase–pseudophosphatase pair, a large number (∼12%) of ubiquitin specific proteases (DUSPs) lack conserved catalytic residues and are predicted to be inactive [<xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is possible that the number of predicted inactive DUSPs may be an overestimate, and after further examination some of these DUSPs may indeed turn out to be active. However, important non-catalytic functions that utilise DUSPs’ ability to recognise ubiquitin and function through a similar ‘substrate trapping’ mechanism described for pseudophosphatases [<xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], are possible. The prevalence of non-catalytic functions may relieve the evolutionary pressure for conservation of key catalytic residues and may explain why some of these enzymes appear to be inactive. It also provides an example of nature's ability to repurpose already perfected molecular units in many different ways.</p>

      <title>Concluding remarks</title>
      <p>In recent years, a burst of studies have provided valuable insights into the biological functions and the mechanism of action of pseudokinases. An important revelation is that the initially predicted fraction of kinases that are truly ‘dead’, ∼10% of the human kinome, may have been an overestimate. Despite variations in the catalytic motifs of pseudokinases, nature has acquired alternative mechanisms to correct for the missing functions in phosphoryl transfer, by making use of the versatile kinase fold. Exhaustive structural studies of protein kinases have established that the kinase/pseudokinase domain is plastic, and attains many different conformations in response to binding of micromolecular and macromolecular ligands. Similarly, large conformational changes occur upon postranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. Therefore, pseudokinases can be envisaged as ‘elastic’ scaffolds, bringing together components of a particular signalling network, as well as being allosteric activators of protein kinases.</p>

          <p>Shows that the conformational state of the pseudokinase STRAD is regulated by ATP and the scaffold protein MO25 in a manner analogous to active protein kinases. Together with Ref. [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27<sup>••</sup></xref>] it demonstrates that the conformation of STRAD rather than its catalytic activity is required for activating the LKB1 kinase.</p>

ATP is shown as sticks with magenta carbon atoms. For VRK3 and ROP2, ATP (shown as lines) bound to PKA was modelled in the VRK3 and ROP2 structures by superposition of the PKA structure (PDBID 1ATP). Glycine residues are depicted as green spheres, water molecules are shown as red spheres, Mn<sup>2+</sup> atoms as purple spheres and Mg<sup>2+</sup> as blue spheres. Hydrogen bonding interactions are represented by dashed lines, and residues making up the hydrophobic spine of VRK3 are shown as sticks and transparent surface.</p>

      <p>As more studies are reported that describe pseudokinase structures, their potential activities and functions, it should be possible in the future to determine if these are ‘true’ pseudokinases. Currently, we suggest the following nomenclature for referring to the group of kinases that have been predicted to be catalytically inactive:</p>
      <p><bold>Group 1. Predicted pseudokinases</bold>—These are pseudokinases that have at least one altered residue in the catalytic site and no structural and/or biochemical evidence to support either their activity or inactivity. This currently comprises the largest group, and it remains a challenge for the future to put them either in one of the following two groups, or declare them actual kinases.</p>
      <p><bold>Group 2. Pseudokinases</bold>—These are pseudokinases for which kinase activity has not been detected and inactivity can be accounted for by structural or biochemical studies (e.g. STRAD and ILK). Similarly, pseudokinases that cannot bind ATP (e.g. VRK3 and ROP2/8) should be included in this group.</p>
      <p><bold>Group 3. Low activity kinases</bold>—These are predicted pseudokinases for which kinase activity has been detected (e.g. CASK, IRAK2 and HER3/ErbB3), but by comparison to other kinases (often the closest true kinase paralogue), their activity is very low.</p>
      <p><bold>Group 4. Active pseudokinases</bold>—These are predicted pseudokinases that are highly active despite missing catalytic motifs. These members have evolved compensatory mechanisms for the missing functions of canonical motifs (e.g. WNK1, missing the VAIK motif [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Haspin, missing the DFG motif [<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). It is possible that a sizeable proportion of Group 1 members will be classified as active upon further structural and enzymological characterisation.</p>
