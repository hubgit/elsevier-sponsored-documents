      <abstract>
        <p>Variations in the fatty acid composition of lipids in the heart alter its function and susceptibility to ischaemic injury. We investigated the effect of sex and dietary fat intake on the fatty acid composition of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in rat heart. Rats were fed either 40 or 100 g/kg fat (9:1 lard:soybean oil) from weaning until day 105. There were significant interactive effects of sex and fat intake on the proportions of fatty acids in heart phospholipids, dependent on phospholipid classes. 20:4n-6, but not 22:6n-3, was higher in phospholipids in females than males fed a low, but not a high, fat diet. There was no effect of sex on the composition of triacylglycerol. These findings suggest that sex is an important factor in determining the incorporation of dietary fatty acids into cardiac lipids. This may have implications for sex differences in susceptibility to heart disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The fatty acid composition of membranes is an important determinant of cell function. The relative proportions of the saturated, monounsaturated and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>, modify the biophysical properties of membranes and so change the activities of integral proteins. In addition, variation in phospholipid fatty acid composition may alter cell function by changing the composition of phospholipid-derived second messengers. Membrane phospholipid composition is the product of the specificity of synthesis <italic>de novo</italic>, acyl remodelling mechanisms and differential turnover of individual molecular species <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Together these processes maintain phospholipid class and cell type-specific differences in fatty acid composition.</p>
      <p>A number of recent studies in humans and in animal models have shown that males and females differ in the composition of membrane and plasma phospholipids. For example, women have higher concentrations of 22:6n-3 in plasma phospholipids than men <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[4–7]</xref>. Female rats also have higher phospholipid 22:6n-3 in liver and plasma <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[8–10]</xref>, and in erythrocytes <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> than males. The 20:4n-6 content of rat liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) was also higher in females, but decreased following ooectomy, while administration of oestrogen following orchidectomy to males increased hepatic PC 20:4n-6 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, pregnancy in rats was associated with a specific increase in liver PC16:0/22:6 due to decreased acyl remodelling of newly synthesised PC <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3, which are substrates for synthesis of more complex lipids, can be synthesised from their respective essential fatty acid precursors 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 by sequential desaturation and carbon chain elongation reactions <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In humans, conversion of 18:3n-3 to 22:6n-3 is very limited in men, but substantially higher in women <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref> and is greater still in women using an oestrogen-based oral contraceptive pill <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. mRNA expression of the rate limiting enzyme in 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 synthesis, Δ6-desaturase, is higher in female than male liver <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, we have shown recently the effect of feeding diets to adult rats with different amounts of total fat or different essential fatty acid contents on plasma and liver lipids differed between males and females <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus sex differences in phospholipid composition may reflect the effect of sex hormones on phospholipid biosynthesis, on specificity of synthesis of fatty acid substrates and on differential partitioning of dietary lipids between cellular lipid classes.</p>
      <p>The fatty acid composition of cardiac muscle has been described a number of studies. In rats, heart total phospholipids contain predominately 18:0, 18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6, while triacylglycerol (TAG) was enriched in 16:0, 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. However, these studies focussed exclusively on males. Furthermore, although the fatty acid composition of heart lipids can be modified by dietary fat intake <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>, to our knowledge there is no information as to whether variations in dietary fat induce the same changes in cardiac lipid composition in males and females. Understanding processes which affect the fatty acid composition of heart fatty acids is important because variations in phospholipid composition have been shown to alter cardiac function and susceptibility to disease. For example, increased intake of fish oil improves risk of heart disease and arrhythmia, although these effects are not entirely consistent between studies <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Feeding saturated fatty acids increased the incidence of arrhythmias in isolated rat heart exposed to ischaemia/reperfusion, while tachycardia and fibrillation were reduced by feeding corn oil or fish oil <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Increased incorporation of 20:5n-3 into heart phospholipids also improved recovery from ischaemia/ reperfusion in isolated rat heart <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Decreased 18:2n-6 accompanied by increased 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 in rat heart PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) reduced the sensitivity and number of β-adrenoceptors in cardiac muscle <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, stimulation of β-adrenoceptors in vivo decreased PE and PC 18:2n-6, but increased 20:4n-6 in heart PC and 22:6n-3 in PE which suggests that the PUFA content of cardiac phospholipids may be involved in regulating the activity of β-adrenoceptors <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In rat heart, exercise increased 18:2n-6 and decreased 20:4n-6 in total phospholipids, while TAG was essentially unaltered <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that the composition of lipids in rat heart differed between males and females, and that changes in the fatty acid composition of the heart induced by altering dietary fat intake differ between sexes.</p>

        <p>The study was carried out in accordance with the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). The study from which the hearts were obtained has been described previously <xref rid="bib8 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[8,25]</xref>. Briefly, Virgin female Wistar rats were mated and fed either a protein-sufficient or protein-restricted diet from conception until spontaneous delivery (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Litters were reduced to 8 pups at delivery (equal males and females). Dams were fed AIN-76G diet throughout lactation. The pups were weaned onto a diets containing either containing 40 g/kg (low fat, LF) or 100 g/kg fat (high fat, HF) on post-natal day 28 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The fat component of the post-weaning diet was composed of lard:soybean oil (9:1, w/w). On postnatal day 105, food was withdrawn at about 08:00, but water was available <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and offspring were killed by asphyxiation with CO<sub>2</sub> 6 h later. Hearts were exsanguinated with a hypodermic syringe, and then removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Food intake and weight gain did not differ between dietary groups <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Analysis of fatty acid composition</title>
        <p>The fatty acid composition of ventricle PC, PE and TAG was measured by gas chromatography. Ventricles (approximately 100 mg) were homogenised in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (0.8 ml). Total lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Individual lipid classes were isolated from the total lipid extracts by solid phase extraction using 100 mg aminopropylsilica cartridges (Varian Ltd., Oxford, UK) <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from purified lipid classes from liver by incubation with methanol containing 2% (v/v) sulphuric acid at 50 °C for 2 h <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. FAME were resolved using a 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent, Cheshire, UK) equipped with a 30 m×0.25 μm×0.25 mm BPX-70 fused silica capillary column (SGE, Milton Keynes, UK) and flame ionisation detection <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The proportions of individual fatty acids were determined by measurement of the peak area using ChemStation software (Agilent Ltd.).</p>

      <p>Analysis of the fatty acid compositions of individual heart lipid classes by the general linear model showed significant effects of offspring sex and the diet fed after weaning. However, there was no effect of maternal diet on the fatty acid composition of any of the lipid classes measured. Therefore, the data from the two maternal dietary groups were combined and reanalysed for the effects of offspring sex and post-weaning diet (PWD).</p>

        <title>Heart phosphatidylcholine</title>
        <p>There was a significant interaction between sex and post-weaning diet on the total saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and n-3 PUFA content of PC (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, total n-6 PUFA was only affected by sex (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of 16:0 was decreased slightly in males fed the HF diet, but increased fat intake did not significantly alter PC 16:0 content in females. The proportion of 18:0 was higher in females than males fed a LF diet, but did not differ between sexes in animals fed the HF diet (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 24:0 content of PC was higher in females than males, irrespective of fat intake. Neither sex nor fat intake altered PC 20:0 content. PC 18:1 content was increased in males and females fed the HF diet (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportions of 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3 and 20:3n-6 in heart PC from females was significantly lower than in males fed the LF diet irrespective of their fat intake. However, feeding the HF diet decreased the proportion of these fatty acids in males to a level similar to females (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of 20:4n-6 in heart PC was higher in females than males fed the LF diet irrespective of fat intake (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The HF diet increased the proportion of 20:4n-6 in males to a level similar to that of females. The proportion of 22:5n-3 was similar in LF males and females, while 22:6n-3 tended to be higher in females. Increased fat intake after weaning increased the proportion of 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 to a similar extent in males and females, while 18:3n-3 and 20:5n-3 contents were unaffected by sex or PWD (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There was no effect of sex on the ratio of 20:4n-6 to 22:6n-3 in heart PC. However, this ratio was lower in both males and females fed the HF diet compared to rats fed the LF diet.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The findings of this study show that feeding diets with the same proportions of fatty acids at two levels of total intake to rats from weaning until adult induces specific changes in the composition of individual lipid classes in the heart which are contingent on the sex of the rats.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that sex is an important determinant of the fatty acid composition of liver, plasma and erythrocytes <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[8–11]</xref>, and that incorporation of dietary fats into individual lipids classes in liver and plasma differs between males and females <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The present findings extend these observations to the heart. The fatty acid composition of both heart and liver <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> PC and PE, but not TAG, differed between males and females. 16:0 and 20:4n-6 were higher in females than males in both liver <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and heart PC. 22:6n-3 only showed a trend towards higher concentration in female heart PC, but was significantly higher in female liver. Together, these findings imply that the effects of sex on tissue fatty acid composition may be due in part to differences in the specificity of lipid metabolism in individual tissues as well as the supply of fatty acids from the diet or from blood.</p>
      <p>We have shown recently that sex modifies the effects of differences in dietary fatty acid intake and the amount of fat consumed on the composition of hepatic phospholipids and TAG <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The present findings support the suggestion that sex is also an important determinant of the effects of dietary fat on the fatty acid composition of the heart. The ranking between lipid classes of number of fatty acids which were altered by the interaction of fat intake and sex was PC&gt;PE&gt;TAG. This may be counterintuitive because TAG represents a transient pool into which excess fatty acids not immediately required for β-oxidation are incorporated <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and so may be expected to be modified by fat intake to a greater extent than phospholipids. The mechanism for this apparent difference in susceptibility to dietary change is not known. In heart TAG, increasing fat intake induced similar changes in the proportion of individual fatty acids in both males and females, for example PC 18:1n-7, PE 16:0 and TAG 14:0. However, in phospholipids, increasing fat intake tended to change the proportions of individual fatty acids in phospholipids in males to levels similar to females, while the proportions of fatty acids in females were essentially unchanged by fat intake. This suggests that heart phospholipid composition is more tightly regulated against variations in dietary fat intake in females than males, and thus males may be more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in fat intake, but possibly more amenable to therapeutic interventions such as fish oil.</p>
      <p>Recent studies on the effect of sex on fatty acid composition of tissues in humans and in animals models have focussed on 22:6n-3 concentration particularly in liver and blood <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[4–11]</xref>. The proportion of 22:6n-3 in the heart showed a trend towards higher proportion in PC, and no difference between sexes in PE and TAG. However, 20:4n-6 was higher in PC in female heart compared to males. Since 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 were not provided in any of the diets, this suggests increased conversion from 18:2n-6 18:3n-3, respectively, presumably by the liver, and/or selective uptake and incorporation into heart PC. Higher ratio of 20:4n-6/22:6n-3 in heart phospholipids has been associated with fatal ventricular fibrillation in rats and risk of sudden cardiac death in humans <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. PWD, but not sex, altered this ratio in PC, while there was a significant interaction between sex and PWD on PE. This indicates that dietary fat intake may be a primary determinant of the 20:4n-6 to 22:6n-3 ratio in PC and so may contribute to risk of arrhythmia. However, it is possible that the interactive effect of sex and dietary fat may modify such risk through changes in the 20:4n-6 to 22:n-3 ratio in PE which, in turn, may alter the activities of ion channel and receptors.</p>
      <p>The fatty acid composition of the heart has been shown the modify its response to hormones, its electrical activity and its susceptibility to ischaemia <xref rid="bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[19–22]</xref>. If the findings of the present study were replicated in humans, one possible implication is that variations in membrane fatty acid composition may contribute to differences in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease between men and women <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
