      <abstract>
        <p>Modification/chlorination of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), formed by the myeloperoxidase–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system of activated phagocytes, converts an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein into a pro-inflammatory lipoprotein particle. Chlorinated HDL is present in human lesion material, binds to and is internalized by endothelial cells and impairs expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The present study aimed at clarifying whether exposure of endothelial cells to pro-inflammatory HOCl–HDL impacts on expression of heme oxygenase-1, a potential rescue pathway against endothelial dysfunction. Our findings revealed that HDL modified by HOCl, added as reagent or generated enzymatically, induced phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, expression of transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) and enhanced expression of heme oxygenase-1 in human endothelial cells. Upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 could be blocked by an inhibitor upstream of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or knockdown of Egr-1 by RNA-interference. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated HOCl–HDL-mediated induction of the Egr-1 DNA binding activity. Immunocytochemical and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated HOCl–HDL-induced translocation of Egr-1 to the nucleus. The present study demonstrates a novel compensatory pathway against adverse effects of HOCl–HDL, providing cytoprotection in a number of pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epidemiological studies have established an inverse correlation between the risk for atherosclerosis, the plasma levels of apolipoprotein A–I (apoA–I)<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–cholesterol. In line, pharmacological strategies show that raising HDL–cholesterol prevents coronary heart disease <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Besides an array of potential anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activities <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> the most important vasculoprotective function of apoA–I and HDL is the role in ‘reverse cholesterol transport’ <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Accumulating evidence suggested that HDL and apoA–I become dysfunctional in ‘reverse cholesterol transport’ after oxidative modification. The phagocytic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), an established cardiovascular risk factor <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, is considered a prime modulator to form a pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic HDL particle. MPO, abundantly present in neutrophils and monocytes uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and chloride ions to generate chlorinating oxidants, in particular hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which play an important role in killing microorganisms <xref rid="b0025 b0030 b0035" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>MPO is enzymatically active in human atheroma <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and immunoreactivity for the enzyme is prominent in intimal mononuclear cells in all regions of human atheroma <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that specific epitopes derived from HOCl colocalized with apoA–I <xref rid="b0050 b0055" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. Findings that apoA–I represents a selective target for MPO-catalyzed oxidation <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> support observations on functional impairment of modified HDL <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref rid="b0065 b0070" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Attachment of MPO to and colocalization of HOCl-modified epitopes with apoA–I on endothelial cells <xref rid="b0050 b0070" ref-type="bibr">[10,14]</xref> suggested adverse cellular effects of chlorinated HDL. We previously reported that HOCl–HDL interacts with human umbilical venous endothelial cells <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> thereby impairing their vasculoprotective function <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, at sites of vascular inflammation endothelial cells may exert adaptive responses against cell damage and denudation that promote plaque erosion and thrombosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Induction of inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by a broad spectrum of agents represents an important cytoprotective pathway to alleviate endothelial dysfunction in response to inflammatory insults.</p>
      <p>The cytoprotective effects of the stress-response protein HO-1 are reported to be due to its ability to degrade the pro-oxidative heme to anti-oxidative bile pigments <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and to generate carbon monoxide that exhibits anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It was shown previously that HO-1 accumulation is accompanied by increased bilirubin levels in rabbit atherosclerotic lesions <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Induction of HO-1 expression reversed the progression of vulnerable plaques into more stable lesions <xref rid="b0100 b0105" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>, whereas the lack of HO-1 led to an exacerbation of plaque formation <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, binds to the <italic>cis</italic>-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) of stress responsive genes including HO-1 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It was shown previously that oxidized low-density lipoprotein promotes induction of HO-1 in human smooth muscle cells via activation of protein kinase C, stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase, p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and Nrf2 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The zinc-finger transcription factor early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) belongs to the family of immediate-early genes that binds to GC-rich sequences in the promoter region of target genes involved in the development of atherosclerosis <xref rid="b0125 b0130 b0135" ref-type="bibr">[25–27]</xref>. Egr-1 is highly expressed in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and is induced by modified low-density lipoprotein in human monocytes <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Previous reports show that phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK leads to induction of Egr-1 expression <xref rid="b0150 b0155" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref> and that transcriptional activation of HO-1 by Egr-1 is induced by several triggers present in atherosclerotic vascular disease <xref rid="b0160 b0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Oxidative stress causes enhanced endothelial cell injury in human and animal HO-1 deficiency <xref rid="b0110 b0170" ref-type="bibr">[22,34]</xref>. As staining for MPO and HOCl-modified epitopes was present within and around endothelial cells in both human and animal lesions <xref rid="b0175 b0180" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref> where HO-1 is also highly expressed <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> the present study aimed at investigating signalling pathways leading to HO-1 expression in human endothelial cells in response to HOCl–HDL.</p>

        <p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, <italic>d</italic> = 1.035–1.065 g/ml) was isolated from plasma of healthy, normolipidemic subjects by ultracentrifugation as described <xref rid="b0190 b0195" ref-type="bibr">[38,39]</xref>. The protein of the final LDL preparation consisted of 96–98% apoB-100 as measured immunochemically. HDL (subclass 3, density = 1.125–1.21 g/ml) was further isolated by discontinuous density ultracentrifugation <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and stored at 4 °C until usage. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Native LDL and HDL were desalted using PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare, Vienna, Austria) prior to modification. HOCl–LDL was prepared as described <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Briefly, one mg LDL protein per ml PBS (10mM, pH 7.4) was incubated with HOCl-solution (60 min, 4 °C). For LDL incubated in between 0.2 and 1.6 mM final HOCl concentration this resulted in an oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio in between 100:1 and 800:1. Modification of HDL by reagent HOCl was performed as described <xref rid="b0050 b0205" ref-type="bibr">[10,41]</xref>. Briefly, 2.5 mg of HDL/ml of PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) were modified by the single addition of HOCl (see above). For HDL (and BSA) incubated in between 0.2 and 1.6 mM final HOCl concentration this resulted in an oxidant:(lipo)protein molar ratio in between 25:1 and 200:1 <xref rid="b0075 b0200" ref-type="bibr">[15,40]</xref>. Alternatively, HDL was modified by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> (approx. oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio of 25:1). Briefly, 1 mg of HDL/ml of PBS was modified at pH 7.4 (37 °C) by alternate additions of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and MPO (final concentrations: 440 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 8 μg/ml MPO (Planta Natural Products, Vienna, Austria)); in some experiments ascorbate was added (final concentration 14 μM; assuming a quantitative conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, an oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio up to 50:1 can be expected). The modified (lipo)protein-preparations were passed over a PD10 column to remove unreacted HOCl and used immediately for cell culture experiments.</p>

        <p>Cells were seeded into respective cell culture dishes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) and grown until reaching confluence. The medium was changed to complete medium without FCS and HAT and after 16 h incubation time, native or modified HDL, LDL or BSA was directly added into the medium to start the experiment. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated for 30 min with the respective signal transduction inhibitors for p42/44 MAPK kinase (PD98059, 25 μM) and for p38 MAPK (SB203580, 10 μM) (Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). Experiments were terminated by aspiration of the medium and washing the cells twice with cold PBS.</p>

Cell lysates were scraped and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry. Three times reducing sample buffer (8% (w:v) SDS, 18% (v:v) glycerine, 114 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 0.04% (w:v) bromphenol-blue and 5% (v:v) mercaptoethanol) was added to equal amounts (50–100 μg) of total cell lysates, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4–12% gradient Bis–Tris Gels (Invitrogen, Lofer, Austria) and proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w:v) non-fat milk (30 min) and afterwards incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: Mouse monoclonal β-actin (C4) antibody, rabbit polyclonal lamin A/C (H-110) antibody, rabbit polyclonal Egr-1 (C19) antibody and rabbit polyclonal Nrf2 (C-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA); mouse monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) antibody and rabbit polyclonal phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA); rabbit polyclonal HO-1 (Hsp32) antibody (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies and added at 25 °C for 1.5 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate.</p>

        <title>RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR</title>
        <p>Total RNA from endothelial cells was isolated using QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of RNA was subjected to DNaseI digestion and reverse transcription (Invitrogen, Lofer, Austria) using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Six nanograms of cDNA was used as template for each Real-time PCR. Gene expression was determined by quantitative Real-time PCR using the LightCycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) and the QIAGEN QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit. QIAGEN QuantiTect Primer Assays were used to determine gene expression of Egr-1 (Hs_Egr1_2_SG), HO-1 (Hs_HMOX1_1_SG), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Hs_GAPDH_2_SG), respectively. For detection of Nrf2 gene expression the following primer pair was used: forward 5′-TAC TCC CAG GTT GCC CAC A-3′ and reverse 5′-CAT CTA CAA ACG GGA ATG TCT GC-3′.

Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and once with cold buffer A (10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets). Cells were lysed in buffer A including 0.1% (v:v) Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice, centrifuged at 4500<italic>g</italic> (4 °C, 10 min); the supernatant, containing the cytosolic fraction, was stored at −70 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed once in PBS, once in buffer A and lysed in buffer C (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 25% (v:v) glycerol and Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets) for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000<italic>g</italic> (4 °C, 20 min); the supernatant, containing the nuclear fraction, was stored at −70 °C.</p>

        <title>HOCl–HDL-mediates activation of p42/44 and p38 MAPK</title>
        <p>Native HDL has been reported to promote activation of p38 MAPK in human umbilical venous endothelial cells <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We here show that native HDL is able to induce phosphorylation of p42/44 and p38 MAPKs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in human EA.hy926 endothelial cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B).</p>
        <p>We further tested the capacity of chlorinated HDL to activate these MAPKs. HOCl–HDL induced phosphorylation of p42/44 and p38 MAPKs also in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C and D); maximum phosphorylation for both MAPKs was observed between 5 and 10 min after stimulation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C) at a protein concentration of 100 μg protein (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D, <xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">Supplement Fig. ID</xref>). Phosphorylation of p42/44 by HOCl–HDL after 5 min was more pronounced when compared to native HDL (<xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">Supplement Fig. IC</xref>). Incubation of cells with PD98059 (an inhibitor for p42/44 MAPK kinase) for 30 min prior to stimulation with HOCl–HDL completely blocked phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). In contrast, SB203580 did not impair immunoreactive pp38 MAPK but enhanced p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation (<xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">Supplement Fig. IE</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, modification of HDL was performed enzymatically as occurring under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Modification of HDL with HOCl generated by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system in the absence or presence of ascorbate (an enhancer of chlorination reaction of MPO <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>) also led to pronounced phosphorylation of p42/44 and p38 MAPKs as shown for HDL modified by reagent HOCl (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>F).</p>

        <title>HOCl–HDL mediated activation of transcription factor Egr-1 via pp42/44 MAPK signalling</title>
        <p>Next, we tested whether HOCl–HDL is able to induce known transcriptional activators of the HO-1 gene, i.e. Egr-1 and Nrf2. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A shows time-dependent transcriptional activation of Egr-1 in response to HOCl–HDL. HOCl–HDL rapidly activated transcription of Egr-1 with maximum levels observed at 30 min. The response to native HDL after 1 h was 50% lower compared to HOCl–HDL. The p42/44 MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059 completely prevented transcriptional activation of Egr-1 while the p38 MAPK antagonist increased transcriptional activation of Egr-1 in cells incubated with HOCl–HDL or HDL for 1 h (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). On the protein level, HOCl–HDL potently induced expression of Egr-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B and C); maximum of Egr-1 induction was in between 1 and 1.5 h after stimulation (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B); native HDL only slightly induced Egr-1 on the protein level (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B; for densitometric evaluation see <xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">Supplement Fig. IIB and C</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>F, HDL modified by HOCl generated via the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system in the absence or presence of ascorbate had the same effect on Egr-1 protein expression as HDL modified by reagent HOCl (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D); the effect of native HDL on Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression was less pronounced (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, B and D).</p>
        <p>To clarify whether MAPK activation is directly involved in Egr-1 protein expression, cells were preincubated with PD98059 or SB203580 before stimulation with HOCl–HDL. In line with data from <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, the p42/44 MAPK kinase inhibitor completely blocked expression of Egr-1 protein in response to HOCl–HDL (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). Consistent with Egr-1 expression on mRNA level (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), preincubation of cells with SB203580 prior to stimulation with HOCl–HDL potentiated expression of Egr-1 also on the protein level (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). In contrast to Egr-1, Nrf2 expression on mRNA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F) and protein level (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–E</xref>) was unaffected by HOCl- or MPO-modified HDL preparations.</p>
        <p>To follow whether HOCl–HDL-mediated stimulation induces Egr-1 DNA binding activity, nuclear proteins were subjected to EMSA using a specific probe for Egr-1. Time-dependent stimulation of cells with HOCl–HDL led to a maximum in Egr-1 binding after 0.5 h. Competition experiments with an excess of the non-radiolabelled Egr-1 probe confirmed the EMSA band as specific for Egr-1 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This demonstrates that HOCl–HDL enhanced the binding of Egr-1 to its consensus-binding site in the promoter region of target genes.</p>
        <p>Time-course experiments of Egr-1 expression in the cytosolic protein fraction revealed maximum expression in HOCl–HDL-treated cells approx. after 1 h (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). At this (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B) and later time points (1.5 h, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A), pronounced Egr-1 expression became apparent in the nuclear fraction. Egr-1 expression by native HDL was less pronounced in the nuclear fraction compared to HOCl–HDL (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Time-course experiments demonstrated that HOCl–HDL did not affect expression of Nrf2 in the cytosol nor promote nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed HOCl–HDL-induced nuclear translocation of Egr-1 in endothelial cells (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In non-stimulated cells or cells incubated with native HDL staining for Egr-1 was almost exclusively present in the cytosol (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <title>HOCl–HDL-mediated induction of HO-1 via pp42/44 MAPK signalling</title>
        <p>Next, we tested whether HOCl–HDL promotes induction of HO-1. HOCl–HDL promoted high expression of HO-1 on mRNA level (maximum in between 4 and 8 h); native HDL had no effect on HO-1 expression (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Western blot experiments revealed that HOCl–HDL induced expression of HO-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B and C) with a maximum HO-1 expression after 12 h (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). Induction of HO-1 was similar in cells in the absence or presence of native HDL (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). HDL modified by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system had a less pronounced effect on HO-1 expression (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D). To directly address involvement of MAPK activation in HO-1 expression, cells were preincubated with respective MAPK (kinase) inhibitors. Only PD98059 impaired expression of immunoreactive HO-1 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E). Although the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 promoted activation of p42/44 MAPK and expression of Egr-1, HO-1 expression was not affected.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A demonstrates that HO-1 expression increases with increasing degree of HDL modification. To reveal whether up-regulation of HO-1 by HOCl–HDL is specific for HDL, the cells were incubated with HOCl–LDL (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A) or HOCl–BSA (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). Although an increasing oxidant:(lipo)protein molar ratio of LDL and BSA tended to increase HO-1 expression, HOCl–LDL and HOCl–BSA were less effective inducers of HO-1 upregulation when compared to HOCl–HDL. No difference in HO-1 expression was observed when BSA or fatty acid-free BSA was used in cell culture experiments.</p>

        <title>Egr-1 is involved in HOCl–HDL-mediated activation of HO-1</title>
        <p>To reveal that Egr-1 is directly involved in HOCl–HDL-mediated activation of HO-1, Egr-1 was silenced by RNA interference. Due to the low basal Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels the silencing efficiency of RNA interference was analyzed in HOCl–HDL-treated cells. Therefore, experiments revealed that under our experimental conditions transfection of Egr-1 specific siRNA led to a reduced silencing efficiency. <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A/B showed that a specific siRNA directed against Egr-1 inhibits HOCl–HDL-mediated expression of Egr-1 and HO-1 on mRNA level in between 40% and 50%. Western blot experiments confirmed knockdown of Egr-1 (1.5 h) and HO-1 protein (12 h) up to 60% (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>C/D); the scrambled control siRNA had no effect on HOCl–HDL-mediated induction of Egr-1 and HO-1.</p>
        <p><xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>E showed the presence of immunoreactive Egr-1 in the cytosolic fraction. HOCl–HDL only slightly enhanced immunoreactive Egr-1 in the cytosolic fraction compared to non-stimulated cells (lanes 5 and 6); however, in parallel, HOCl–HDL increased immunoreactive Egr-1 in the nucleus (lane 2). Silencing of Egr-1 resulted in a lower nuclear Egr-1 protein content as compared to cells treated with scrambled control siRNA (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>E, lanes 3 and 4).</p>
        <p>Expression of Nrf2 remained constant in the cytosol in the absence or presence of HOCl–HDL and was not detected in the nucleus (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>E).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Accumulating reports confirmed that MPO-mediated loss of the atheroprotective functional properties of HDL might provide a novel mechanism linking inflammation and oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis <xref rid="b0070 b0230 b0235" ref-type="bibr">[14,46,47]</xref>. HDL isolated from human atheroma is modified by MPO-derived oxidants and even acts as an <italic>in vivo</italic> carrier of MPO <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most importantly, chloramines, formed during HOCl-treatment of apoA–I lysine residues enhance binding of MPO to modified/chlorinated HDL <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> thus favouring amplification of the modification cycle. In addition to decreased cholesterol acceptor activities, HDL modified by HOCl (added as reagent or generated by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system) is subject to efficient uptake and degradation by macrophages <xref rid="b0205 b0245" ref-type="bibr">[41,49]</xref>, an event leading to foam cell formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Wang and co-workers <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> previously demonstrated high HO-1 expression in macrophages, foam cells and endothelial cells in human and animal atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, selective overexpression of HO-1 decreased lesion size in apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref rid="b0105 b0250" ref-type="bibr">[21,50]</xref>. Ishikawa and colleagues <xref rid="b0255 b0260" ref-type="bibr">[51,52]</xref> showed that inducers of HO-1 induce atheroprotective pathways e.g. diminished lesion size in apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. In line, double knockout mice deficient in HO-1 and apoE develop larger and more advanced lesions than apoE<sup>−/−</sup> littermates when fed a hypercholesterolemic diet <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Induction of HO-1 expression functions as a protective feedback mechanism to prevent endothelial cell dysfunction in response to inflammatory assaults. Results of the present study indicate that upregulation of HO-1 in response to pro-inflammatory chlorinated HDL might represent a hitherto unrecognized protection pathway in endothelial cells. We propose that the underlying signalling machinery that leads to HO-1 transcription might function as a first line of defence against HOCl–HDL-mediated cell dysfunction.</p>
      <p>Low concentrations of HOCl induce the apoptotic machinery in endothelial cells <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> while high concentrations promote a significant rise in HO-1 via the Nrf2/ARE pathway to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Nrf2 has recently been reported to regulate the induction of HO-1 in response to various forms of cellular stress, including hemodynamics and endoplasmic reticulum stress <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Moreover, fibroblasts from Nrf2<sup>−/−</sup> mice express reduced levels of HO-1 mRNA <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Results of the present study identified an alternative pathway for HO-1 induction by HOCl–HDL via intermediate activation of Egr-1. A striking observation was that the commonly used pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 did not inhibit lipoprotein-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). However, this is in line with findings that SB203580 does not block all p38 MAPK isoforms <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> but preferentially exerts inhibition downstream of pp38 MAPK signalling <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Another observation was that the pyridinyl imidazole p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 even enhanced p42/44 MAPK activation in the presence of HOCl–HDL (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). This one-way communication between p38 and p42/44 MAPKs has previously been addressed in other cellular systems <xref rid="b0290 b0295 b0300 b0305" ref-type="bibr">[58–61]</xref>. SB203580 inhibits p38 MAPK α-isoform signalling leading to increased phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK <xref rid="b0295 b0300" ref-type="bibr">[59,60]</xref>. As Egr-1 expression is p42/44 MAPK-dependent under our experimental conditions, enhanced expression of Egr-1 on mRNA and protein levels in cells treated with HOCl–HDL and SB203580 may be expected (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>A/E). Recent findings revealed that SB203580-mediated expression of Egr-1 in the absence or presence of other agonists is completely blocked by addition of p42/44 MAPK inhibitors <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Egr-1 transcription is activated by different subgroups of MAPKs <xref rid="b0150 b0155 b0310 b0315" ref-type="bibr">[30,31,62,63]</xref>. We here show that activation of p42/44 by HOCl–HDL is an initial event in this cascade. HOCl–HDL binds to scavenger receptor SR-BI <xref rid="b0050 b0075" ref-type="bibr">[10,15]</xref> and lipoprotein binding may promote phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Therefore, binding of HOCl–HDL to SR-BI might be an initiating event in this cascade.</p>
      <p>Egr-1 acts as transcriptional regulator of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Indeed, high-level expression of Egr-1 and Egr-1 inducible genes have been observed in human and murine lesion material <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Other data obtained with fibroblasts provide evidence that Egr-1 might directly activate HO-1 <xref rid="b0160 b0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>. We here show that treatment of endothelial cells with chlorinated HDL involves activation of p42/44 MAPK, subsequent expression and nuclear translocation of Egr-1 and direct activation of HO-1. Multiple approaches were used to validate this signalling pathway(s): first, expression of Egr-1 and HO-1 in response to HOCl–HDL was investigated on mRNA and protein level; second, a well characterized inhibitor revealed that Egr-1 and HO-1-mediated activation is p42/44 MAPK dependent; third, involvement of Egr-1 in HO-1 expression and its nuclear localization was confirmed by EMSA, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and Egr-1 RNA interference, respectively. Most importantly, Egr-1 activation was observed in response to HDL modified by HOCl that was added as reagent or generated enzymatically by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system; the HOCl:HDL molar ratio used during the present study (25:1 to 50:1 for MPO-modified HDL) most probably reflects physiological conditions. Assuming a HOCl concentration up to 340 μM <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> under acute inflammation and a HDL<sub>3</sub> plasma concentration of 6–12 μM <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> this would result in a HOCl:lipoprotein molar ratio under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>Treatment of human umbilical venous endothelial cells with reagent HOCl or HOCl-modified lipoproteins leads to reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dimer stability <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and reduced expression and activity of eNOS <xref rid="b0080 b0335" ref-type="bibr">[16,67]</xref> apparently due to eNOS delocalization from the plasma membrane. Heiss and co-workers <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> demonstrated that eNOS downregulation in endothelial cells parallels HO-1 induction with subsequent local and transient heme deficiency. Most importantly, murine Egr-1 has recently been identified to promote transcriptional repression of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Also taurine, when chlorinated by the MPO–H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–chloride system, induces HO-1 expression and inhibits NO synthesis <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>; however, this activation process occurring in macrophages involves the Nrf2 but not the Egr-1/HO-1 axis <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.</p>
      <p>HO-1 is a cytoprotective enzyme and its induction commonly occurs in the setting of increased cellular response to maintain physiological haemostasis <xref rid="b0250 b0280" ref-type="bibr">[50,56]</xref>. More recently it has been reported that also in cultured smooth muscle cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress increased HO-1 mRNA and protein via the ARE, and this was associated with cell survival. However, these studies mostly include activation of HO-1 via the Nrf2-axis <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. HO-1 regulation responds to a large and broad spectrum of chemical stresses, including agents that cause oxidative stress or diminish oxygen and thiol-reactive agents. A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that hydroperoxides, oxidized phospholipids, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and HOCl, respectively, may induce HO-1 <xref rid="b0250 b0270" ref-type="bibr">[50,54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We now show that chlorinated HDL is able to promote expression of HO-1 via a selective signalling cascade involving p42/44 activation and nuclear translocation of Egr-1 (<xref rid="f0015 f0020 f0025 f0030 f0035 f0040" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3–8</xref>) although the possibility of alternative activation pathways cannot be excluded. The ability of endothelial cells to respond adequately against adverse effects of chlorinated HDL suggests a novel, Egr-1- but not Nrf2-mediated compensatory pathway, providing cytoprotection in a number of pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease. Whether the lipid moiety of modified HDL or chloramines are responsible for this effect is currently under investigation.</p>
