        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The widespread and functionally varied members of the ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily provide an excellent opportunity to study evolutionary forces at work on a conserved protein scaffold. Representatives from the zebrafish are of particular interest as the evolutionary distance from non-ichthyic homologues is large. We conducted an exhaustive survey of available zebrafish DNA sequences and found significant polymorphism among its four known homologues. In an extension of previous nomenclature, the variants have been named RNases ZF-1a–c,-2a–d,-3a–e and-4. We present the first X-ray crystal structures of zebrafish ribonucleases, RNases ZF-1a and-3e at 1.35-and 1.85 Å resolution, respectively. Structure-based clustering with ten other ribonuclease structures indicates greatest similarity to mammalian angiogenins and amphibian ribonucleases, and supports the view that all present-day ribonucleases evolved from a progenitor with three disulphide bonds. In their details, the two structures are intriguing melting-pots of features present in ribonucleases from other vertebrate classes. Whereas in RNase ZF-1a the active site is obstructed by the C-terminal segment (as observed in angiogenin), in RNase ZF-3e the same region is open (as observed in more catalytically efficient homologues). The progenitor of present-day ribonucleases is more likely to have had an obstructive C terminus, and the relatively high similarity (late divergence) of RNases ZF-1 and-3 infers that the active site unblocking event has happened independently in different vertebrate lineages.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pyrimidine-specific ribonucleases with homology to bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A; EC 3.1.27.5) are remarkably widespread among vertebrates. Representatives have been isolated from mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and, most recently, fish.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–4</sup></xref> Many of these enzymes are endowed with special biological activity(ies); for example, some stimulate the development of vascular endothelial cells,<xref rid="bib2 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,5,6</sup></xref> dendritic cells,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and neurons,<xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,9</sup></xref> are cytotoxic/anti-tumoral<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and/or anti-pathogenic.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In some cases, this is dependent on catalytic activity, but in others, it is not. In view of these features, the RNase A superfamily provides an excellent opportunity to study evolutionary forces at work on a conserved protein scaffold.</p>
      <p>Current structural data indicate that catalytically active members of the superfamily typically comprise a polypeptide chain of 119 ± 15 residues, have an α + β topology with three conserved disulphide bond positions (SCOP<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> code 54076), and employ a catalytic triad of residues (two His, one Lys) to cleave RNA on the 3′-side of pyrimidine nucleotides.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Structural diversity comes in several forms. Some of these are more biochemical in nature, such as the oligomeric state<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> or surface charge density,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> while others are more subtle, such as where the modification of loop regions alters the fine structure of the active site. Here, evolutionary forces have refined the ribonucleolytic performance of different members. Importantly, all the aforementioned forms of structural variation are known to influence biological activity.</p>
      <p>Recent surveys of the data from zebrafish cDNA and genome sequencing projects have led to the identification and characterisation of RNase A homologues in this species.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> The enzymes have varying ribonucleolytic strength and are endowed variously with angiogenic and anti-bacterial activities. This, allied with sequence homology to mammalian angiogenin (Ang), has led to their classification as Ang-like and has been used to support the view that all present-day RNases evolved from Ang-like progenitors.<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3,15</sup></xref> In the present study, we reinvestigate the available sequence data and find that, in line with the high degree of genetic variation in this species,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> zebrafish ribonucleases exhibit significant polymorphism. At an early point in this investigation (and before the publication of the first report on zebrafish ribonuclease sequences),<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> we selected a range of variants for further study. We present here the X-ray crystal structures of two representatives that yielded high-resolution data. Through systematic comparison of the most divergent regions of structure, we generate further evidence for the evolutionary origins of present-day ribonucleases. Most importantly, the structures reveal the three-dimensional details of relationships with other enzymes that are not prominent in amino acid sequence alignments and illustrate the assignment of kinship.</p>

        <title>Polymorphism</title>
        <p>The combined efforts of two research groups have identified four nucleotide sequences encoding homologues of RNase A in the zebrafish (RNases ZF-1–4).<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> The tissues and breeding lines from which these sequences were derived are varied, which prompted us to conduct an exhaustive survey of available zebrafish sequences. For RNases ZF-1,-2 and-3, we identified three, four and five variants, respectively, which we designate 1a–c, 2a–d and 3a–e (an extension of the nomenclature used by Pizzo and D’Alessio<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>), while for RNase ZF-4, we could not add to the single known form (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The set of sequences includes representatives from the Tübingen (TU), AB, SJD and Singapore wild-type lines,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and gives an indication of the variation within and between the different lines. Throughout, signal peptide cleavage sites predicted with SignalP 3.0 were consistent with those reported by Cho and Zhang,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> but were three or four residues upstream of those suggested by Pizzo <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
        <p>A gene encoding RNase ZF-1 is yet to be found in the genome assembly (version 7 at the time of writing), and corresponding sequences are currently restricted to cDNA libraries. RNase ZF-1a is the clone identified by Pizzo <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> in RZPD 609 (also known as MPMGp609), a library constructed from multiple tissues extracted from multiple, non-inbred individuals.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> RNases ZF-1b and-1c are encoded by clones present in a library prepared from an SJD embryo. We obtained I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clones of RNases ZF-1a–c and found that the deposited sequences were incomplete, lacking five or six residues at the C terminus. RNases ZF-1b and-1c are more similar to each other (two mismatches) than to RNase ZF-1a (four mismatches).</p>
        <p>The sequence of RNase ZF-2a corresponds to that reported previously,<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> is present in the genome assembly and is well represented in the non-normalised cDNA libraries FDR107 and NIH_ZGC_8. RNase ZF-2b is found in a single instance in two independent libraries, while RNases ZF-2c and-2d are single-copy members of NIH_ZGC_8. RNase ZF-2a differs considerably from RNases 2b–d (30 mismatches) which are closely related to one another (two variable positions).</p>
        <p>RNase ZF-3a is encoded by a gene in the genome assembly, while RNases ZF-3b and-3c correspond to the cDNA sequence variants obtained by Pizzo <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and Cho and Zhang (“<italic>Dr</italic>-RNase 1”)<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> using an unspecified breeding line and the AB line, respectively. RNase ZF-3d is well represented in cDNA libraries prepared from the TU and AB lines, and is present in the Singapore line, while RNase ZF-3e was detected only in the Singapore line. Among this group, the mature protein sequence shows six positions of variance.</p>
        <p>The sequence of RNase ZF-4 was deduced by Cho and Zhang from DNA sequences obtained from the TU and AB lines (“<italic>Dr</italic>-RNase 3”).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> We found no corresponding cDNA or additional sequence information in the databases.</p>

        <title>Ribonucleolytic activity</title>
        <p>RNase ZF-1a cleaves tRNA with a specific activity that is almost identical with that of human angiogenin (hAng) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), i.e. some four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of RNase A. This is the first report of its activity toward a polymeric substrate. The relative activities of RNase ZF-1a and hAng are slightly different from those measured for the cleavage of 6-carboxyfluorescein-dArUdAdA-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (6-FAM-dArUdAdA-TAMRA; a short fluorogenic substrate), where the specific activity of RNase ZF-1a is 3-fold greater.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> RNase ZF-3e is 17–20-fold more active than RNase ZF-1a or hAng toward tRNA. This is approximately double the figure reported previously for the cleavage of yeast tRNA by RNase ZF-3c,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> or the cleavage of 6-FAM-dArUdAdA-TAMRA by RNase ZF-3b.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
        <p>In the natural host, RNases ZF-1a and-3e most likely possess an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue (Pca1). The proteins assayed here differ in that Pca1 is replaced with Met(–1)–Gln1. When such a replacement is made in hAng, there is no change in ribonucleolytic activity<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> owing to the presence of a relatively long N-terminal segment that distances Pca1 from the active site; the same is expected for RNases ZF-1a and-3e. Experiments described below employed forms of RNases ZF-1a and-3e possesing an N-terminal His-tag. Their specific activities differed from those of their Met(–1) counterparts by no more than 30% (data not shown). Since the formation of the catalytic site in an RNase A homologue requires the precise alignment of several non-contiguous structural elements, this indicates that the tags do not have a major impact on the overall protein conformation.</p>

        <title>Quality of the crystal structures</title>
        <p>His-tagged forms of RNases ZF-1a and-3e were crystallised in the presence of high-molecular mass poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) at pH 8–8.5, yielding monomeric structures at resolutions of 1.35 Å and 1.85 Å, respectively. The final models comprise residues (–1)–126 and 5–127, respectively (negative residue numbers denote those belonging to the His tag). Both His tags are significantly disordered, as are the C-terminal residue of RNase ZF-1a and the N-terminal four residues of RNase ZF-3e, but elsewhere the main chain is well ordered. Ramachandran plots indicate that the proportions of non-Pro/Gly residues falling in the most favoured regions are 91.6 % and 90.7 %, respectively, with the remainder in the other allowed regions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Topological overview and structure-based clustering</title>
        <p>The main chain of both structures adopts the characteristic bi-lobed α+β-fold of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a and b). The two C<sup>α</sup> atom traces are more similar to each other (rms deviation = 1.1 Å for 115 equivalent atoms) than to any other structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Within the PDB, the best global matches are made with orthologues of RNase 5 (e.g. hAng) and RNase 1 (e.g. RNase A), which are of mammalian origin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c–e). When aligned pairwise with hAng (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="1B1I" ext-link-type="gen">1B1I</ext-link>),<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> RNases ZF-1a and-3e deviate by 1.6 Å (rms) over 112 and 108 equivalent atoms, respectively; with RNase A (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="1RPG" ext-link-type="gen">1RPG</ext-link>),<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> the corresponding figures are 1.5 Å and 1.8 Å over 107 and 112 equivalent atoms.</p>
        <p>Although the RNase A superfamily presents a highly conserved core topology, its constituent clades are defined to a large degree by the structures of extraneous regions such as loops and the fringes of the secondary structure elements. A cursory inspection of the available structures reveals that the zebrafish RNases have a characteristically long H2–B1 loop (<xref rid="fig3 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 and 4</xref>); human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (hEDN), human eosinophil cationic protein (hECP) and hRNase 7 have an unusually long B6–B7 loop;<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23–25</sup></xref> amphibian RNases have a general economy of loops;<xref rid="bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26–28</sup></xref> and the C-terminal segment of angiogenins is obstructive to substrate binding.<xref rid="bib21 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,29,30</sup></xref> With this in mind, we sought to identify the three-dimensional relationships among RNase ZF-1a, RNase ZF-3e and a representative set of ribonucleases through alignment of their C<sup>α</sup> coordinates and application of a loop-based Hausdorff measure (LHM) of structural dissimilarity.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The measure was applied to eight variable segments, most being loops but some having the potential for well-defined secondary structure, e.g. those corresponding to strand B2 and the C-terminal portion of strand B7 in RNase A. The LHM scores ranged from 1.45–8.01 Å and the resulting pairwise distance matrix enabled the construction of a clustering tree (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The tree indicates that RNases ZF-1 and-3 are more similar to amphibian RNases and angiogenins than to other mammalian ribonucleases such as RNase A, which is consistent with previous sequence-based phylogenetic analyses.<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2–4</sup></xref> The tree also supports a pathway for the emergence of the known disulphide-bonding patterns in which all present-day RNases derive from a progenitor with three disulphide bonds.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The high resolution of the present structures permits a more detailed analysis of their structural and evolutionary links to other ribonucleases. The region that offers the greatest resource of structure-function data is the active site.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Its central portion is conventionally divided into three subsites designated P<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>, which bind the scissile phosphodiester linkage of the RNA substrate and the nucleotide bases located immediately upstream (a pyrimidine) and downstream (preferentially a purine), respectively.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> For all known RNase A homologues, these subsites are formed by residues located on opposing sides of the cleft between the two lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d). Across the superfamily, one of the lobes (composed principally of the B2–B3–B6–B7 β-sheet and its associated loops) exhibits structural variations that impact significantly on enzymatic performance and contribute to novel biological functions. Of particular interest is the β-hairpin formed by strands B2 and B3 at one edge, and strand B7 and the short C-terminal segment at the other. These regions are described in detail below.</p>

        <title>P<sub>1</sub> subsite and catalytic centre</title>
        <p>The structure of the P<sub>1</sub> subsite is strongly conserved between RNase A and the zebrafish enzymes. It follows that the catalytic triad of RNase ZF-1a comprises His16, Lys47 and His119, while other phosphate-binding interactions are likely to be made by the side-chain amide group of Gln15 and the main chain N atom of Tyr120 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In RNase ZF-3e, the corresponding residues are His16, Lys45 and His120, plus Gln15 and Tyr121. Typically, the C-terminal catalytic histidine adopts two main conformations, designated <italic>A</italic> (productive) and <italic>B</italic> (non-productive).<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Only <italic>A</italic> is observed for His119 of RNase ZF-1a, while a 50/50 mixture of <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> is observed for His120 of RNase ZF-3e. The absence of conformation <italic>B</italic> in RNase ZF-1a appears to be due to the crystal packing arrangement, which forces the side chain of Arg8 into the space occupied by conformation <italic>B</italic>.

        <title>B<sub>1</sub> subsite and C-terminal segment</title>
        <p>Structural studies on mammalian and amphibian RNases in complex with cytidylic and uridylic inhibitors indicate that the B<sub>1</sub> subsite is a well-conserved, close-fitting pocket that makes two or three specific interactions with the base.<xref rid="bib22 bib27 bib35 bib36 bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,27,35–38</sup></xref> Each of the present structures displays an obvious homology with previously reported structures in which the bulk of the pocket lining is formed by a universally conserved set of residues: in RNase ZF-1a, His16, Val49, Asn50, Thr51 and Tyr120; in RNase ZF-3e, His16, Val47, Asn48, Thr49 and Tyr121 (the corresponding residues of RNase A are His12, Val43, Asn44, Thr45 and Phe120) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thr51 of ZF-RNase-1a and Thr49 of ZF-RNase-3e are positioned in the same way as Thr45 of RNase A and are therefore expected to be the primary functional components of their respective B<sub>1</sub> subsites, forming a pair of hydrogen bonds with either cytosine or uracil (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a and b). In RNase ZF-1a, the anticipated binding position of the pyrimidine is taken by the side chain of Glu122, which makes two hydrogen bonds with Thr51 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This is reminiscent of hAng, in which a similar obstruction is posed by the corresponding residue, Gln117.<xref rid="bib21 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,29</sup></xref> One residue upstream of the obstructive residue, the main chain begins a deviation from the neighbouring β-strand that marks the beginning of a novel C-terminal conformation (<xref rid="fig3 fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3a and 6a</xref>). There is no interaction between the two residues that flank the obstructive residue (His121 and Asp123), contrasting with the two hydrogen bonds that link the corresponding residues of hAng (Asp116 and Ser118). Furthermore, the Glu122–Asp123 peptide bond is flipped relative to its hAng counterpart, and the C-terminal segment bulges out from the main body of the protein rather than inwards as is the case with hAng. Overall, the C-terminal conformation is less obstructive than that found in hAng; notably, Val125 points away from the B<sub>1</sub> subsite, while its hAng counterpart, Phe120, encroaches on the pyrimidine-binding zone. The segment is stabilised chiefly by a network of electrostatic and polar interactions involving the side chains of two residues from the C-terminal segment (Asp123 and Asn126) and two residues from the main body of the protein (Lys85 and Arg106) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In this respect, it bears some resemblance to murine angiogenin-4 (mAng-4; PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="2J4T" ext-link-type="gen">2J4T</ext-link>),<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> which features an electrostatic interaction between the side chain of Arg99 (the counterpart of Arg106) and the free carboxylate group of the C terminus.</p>
        <p>In RNase ZF-3e, the B<sub>1</sub> subsite is unobstructed and the position expected for the 2-keto group of a bound pyrimidine is occupied by a chloride ion from the crystallisation medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). This has also been observed for RNase A when crystallised in the presence of a high concentration of chloride ions, e.g. PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="1RNX" ext-link-type="gen">1RNX</ext-link>.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> The C-terminal segment follows a path similar to that of RNase A, i.e. strand B7 maintains an extended antiparallel link to strand B6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>b and d). This is further stabilised by a hydrogen bond between Gly124 and the side chain of Arg107 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Arg123, the counterpart of hAng Gln117, is too large a residue to occupy the pyrimidine-binding pocket and its side chain is instead oriented toward the solvent. As such, it is very similar to the Arg/Lys residues found at the corresponding positions in hEDN, hRNase 7 and Amphinase-2 (Amph-2) (PDB entries <ext-link xlink:href="1GQV" ext-link-type="gen">1GQV</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="2HKY" ext-link-type="gen">2HKY</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="2P7S" ext-link-type="gen">2P7S</ext-link>, respectively<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,24,28</sup></xref>).</p>
        <p>The cytidine/uridine specificity of the B<sub>1</sub> subsite varies greatly among pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily members and is known to be modulated by two means. First, the hydrogen-bonding selectivity of the main Thr residue can be influenced by a neighbouring residue and second, additional interactions with the substrate may be made by other residues. In RNase ZF-1a, Lys85 lies adjacent to Thr51 and is the counterpart of the modulatory residues Thr80 and Asp83 that are found in hAng and RNase A, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a and b). No other known RNase structure features a Lys residue at this position. The N<sup>ζ</sup> group of Lys85 makes no interaction with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr51 and is instead engaged in interactions with Asp123 and Asn126 of the C-terminal segment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, it is likely that substrate binding triggers a significant restructuring of the C-terminal segment. During this process, the side chain of Lys85 could become involved in substrate binding. It may form a hydrogen bond with Thr51 or one directly with the 4-keto group of uracil. The guanidino group of Arg106 may also interact with the 4-keto group of uracil, thus emulating Arg101 of RNase 4, a residue that contributes to the strong uridine preference of that enzyme.<xref rid="bib37 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37,40</sup></xref></p>
        <p>In RNase ZF-3e, Thr86 corresponds well with Thr80 of hAng (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>a and b), a residue known to promote uridine selectivity by weakening the interaction between the main Thr residue (Thr44) and the N3 atom of cytosine.<xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,42</sup></xref> The distance between the O<sup>γ1</sup> atoms of Thr49 and Thr86 measures 3.42 Å in the present structure, suggesting that a weak hydrogen bond is present and that Thr86 plays a role similar to that of Thr80 in hAng. Arg107 (the counterpart of Arg101 in RNase 4/Arg106 in RNase ZF-1a ) makes two hydrogen-bonding interactions that orient its guanidino group away from the B<sub>1</sub> subsite, reducing the likelihood of a role in substrate binding.</p>
        <p>In neither of the zebrafish RNases is there a direct counterpart of Ser123 of RNase A, a residue that forms two energetically significant water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the 4-keto group of uridine.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>

        <title>B<sub>2</sub> subsite and B2–B3 β-hairpin</title>
        <p>The ways in which adenylic and guanylic inhibitors are bound by various RNases<xref rid="bib22 bib27 bib38 bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,27,38,44,45</sup></xref> infer that the B<sub>2</sub> subsites of RNases ZF-1a and-3e have several familiar features in common. First, as is the case throughout the superfamily, the imidazole ring of the C-terminal catalytic histidine is positioned to make stacking interactions with the purine ring system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a and b). Second, Glu113 of RNase ZF-1a and Glu114 of RNase ZF-3e are poised to mimic Glu111 of RNase A/Glu97 of <italic>Rana catesbeiana</italic> ribonuclease (RC-RNase)/Glu91 of Onconase (ONC) and may, therefore, form hydrogen bonds with the N1 and/or N2 atoms of guanine. Third, any contribution from the loop of the B2–B3 β-hairpin is likely to be modest. In each case, the loop is fairly short (two residues in RNase ZF-1a, five in RNase ZF-3e) but includes at least one residue (Asn73 in RNase ZF-1a, Asn72 and Asp74 in RNase ZF-3e) that could conceivably interact with the heteroatom at position 6 of a bound purine, although this is most likely to be via a water molecule. Thus, this region is more elaborate than in amphibian RNases (where it is abridged) and is most akin to hAng where the loop comprises three residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). It contrasts with several mammalian enzymes such as RNases 1–4 and 7 where the loop is somewhat longer (eight residues in RNase A), is stabilised by an internal disulphide bond, and hydrogen-bonds directly to adenine (<xref rid="fig3 fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3d and 7b</xref>).</p>
        <p>There is one notable difference between the B<sub>2</sub> subsites of the two zebrafish RNases. While RNase ZF-3e possesses an Ala residue at position 112 (a likely functional counterpart of Ala109, a simple pocket-lining residue of RNase A), RNase ZF-1a has a Lys residue at the corresponding position (residue number 111). The only precedent for this is Lys95 of RC-RNase. In the crystal structure of RC-RNase in complex with d(ACGA) (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="1M07" ext-link-type="gen">1M07</ext-link>), the side chain of Lys95 makes van der Waals interactions with guanine and stabilises the position of Glu97 <italic>via</italic> an N<sup>ζ</sup>–O<sup>ε2</sup> hydrogen bond (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a), thereby making a significant contribution to the guanine preference of the B<sub>2</sub> subsite of that enzyme.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although in the present structure of RNase ZF-1a the side chain of Lys111 is obstructive to purine binding and appears to stabilise a wayward conformation of Glu113, substrate binding may trigger a rearrangement in which Lys111 and Glu113 come to mimic Lys95 and Glu97 of RC-RNase. Indeed, the two RC-RNase residues are also somewhat mobile, as indicated by their conformations in an unpublished nucleotide-free structure (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="1KM9" ext-link-type="gen">1KM9</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our survey of zebrafish sequences revealed significant polymorphism of RNases ZF-1–3. Although the inherent error rates of thermostable polymerases, reverse transcriptase and other procedures give rise to artifacts in all cDNA collections, there are several pointers as to the validity of the current analysis. First, the degree to which experimental artifacts contribute to the sequence variations observed in carefully constructed full-length cDNA libraries such as those of the Mammalian Gene Collection is low, at around 10%.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Second, in several cases (e.g., RNases ZF-2a,-2b and-3b), representatives were found in multiple libraries, which would be highly unlikely to occur by chance. Third, we resequenced representative clones to ensure that the quality of the DNA sequencing was high. With regard to RNase ZF-1 (a copy of which is yet to be found in genomic DNA), each of the three variants that we identified must be taken as equally valid at the present time. In addition, the finding that RNases ZF-2b–d differ from the previously identified RNase ZF-2a at nearly one-quarter of all positions may necessitate the creation of a new RNase ZF-5 class.</p>
      <p>Our structures of RNases ZF-1a and-3e are the first ichthyic ribonuclease structures to be reported. Classification using a loop structure-based dissimilarity measure produced a biologically meaningful tree (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), contrasting with trees derived from measures of core similarity (not shown) and confirming the potential of this approach for obtaining systematic relationships from structural data.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Regions that are not part of the conserved core tend not to be critical to the structural integrity of proteins and evolve mostly through insertion-deletion events.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The tree suggests that this type of event has had a major role in the formation of the present-day ribonuclease clades and in the development of their special biological activities. Attributing statistical significance to particular branches of the tree is currently not possible. Character-based confidence tests, such as bootstrapping,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> are not appropriate, but analytical tests such as those based on weighted least-squares<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> could be used if the error of the dissimilarity measure was known. However, this cannot be defined satisfactorily at present, as it depends on multiple factors including the resolution of the structures, the quality of the structural alignment and any disorder in the loop regions.</p>
      <p>While sequence data suggest that all present-day ribonucleases descend from a progenitor with three disulphide bonds,<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib4 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2–4,15</sup></xref> the structure of RNase ZF-3e advances the debate. Its combination of three disulphide bonds and an unobstructive C terminus—which is also likely to be a feature of some reptilian and avian ribonucleases<xref rid="bib6 bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6,51</sup></xref>—raises the question of whether the C terminus of the progenitor was obstructive or not. The clustering tree supports both possibilities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, the relatively high level of similarity (late divergence) of RNases ZF-1 and-3 infers that the unblocking/blocking event has happened independently in different vertebrate lineages. Since the low level of catalytic efficiency that results from an obstructive C-terminus is highly correlated with the presence of angiogenic activity, it seems most likely that the ancestral ribonuclease had an obstructive C terminus; the convergent evolution of angiogenic activity in vertebrate classes as distantly related as mammals and fish seems highly improbable in comparison.</p>
      <p>Several regions of the new structures provide functional insight. In the region of the C-terminal segment, RNase ZF-1a bears an obvious (though incomplete) resemblance to hAng. The binding of RNA substrates to hAng requires a major structural rearrangement of this region,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> and the same appears to be true for RNase ZF-1a, which most likely underpins its low level of ribonucleolytic activity. The unobstructed B<sub>1</sub> subsite of RNase ZF-3e identifies it not with hAng but with most of the other mammalian and all of the known amphibian ribonucleases. As expected, its ribonucleolytic activity is significantly greater than that of RNase ZF-1a or hAng. Since mutations that elevate ribonucleolytic activity are known to be detrimental to the angiogenic activity of mammalian angiogenins,<xref rid="bib30 bib53 bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,53,54</sup></xref> this most likely accounts for the lack of angiogenic activity in its close relative, RNase ZF-3b.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Its enzymatic prowess is still, however, several orders of magnitude lower than that of some relatives, e.g. RNase A. Contributions to this are likely to come from the lack of interactions stabilising the productive tautomer of His120 and the more rudimentary nature of its substrate-binding subsites.</p>
      <p>At the B<sub>1</sub> subsite of RNase ZF-1a, the position of Lys85 and the correspondence of Arg106 to Arg101 of RNase 4 suggest that this enzyme will bind uridine more avidly than cytosine,<xref rid="bib37 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37,40</sup></xref> whereas in RNase ZF-3e, the positions of Thr86 and Arg107 suggest an ambivalence as for hAng.<xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,42</sup></xref> At the B<sub>2</sub> subsite, predictions of base selectivity are hampered somewhat by the variable positioning and orientation of the purine when bound by different enzymes.<xref rid="bib22 bib27 bib38 bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,27,38,44,45</sup></xref> The resemblance of RNase ZF-1a to RC-RNase suggests a preference for guanine over adenine here but the likely preference of RNase ZF-3e is unclear.</p>
      <p>The 11 polymorphisms identified in RNases ZF-1 and-3 are spread over several structural elements (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The residues found at these positions are hydrophilic or small/non-polar and are all at exposed positions, eight being within loops. Most of the substitutions are unlikely to affect substrate binding or catalysis, although the three substitutions in the region of the second catalytic histidine and C-terminal segment may have small effects. It is possible that the Ala/Thr119 and Arg/Lys123 substitutions contribute to the apparent difference between the activities of RNase ZF-3e and-3b/c.</p>
      <p>The wealth of ribonuclease crystal and solution structures permits some predictions about the structures of the remaining zebrafish enzymes. RNase ZF-2 is similar in length to RNases ZF-1 and-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Its H2–B1 and B2–B3 loops are likely to be roughly the same length as those of RNase ZF-1a but its C-terminal segment is unusually long. If we define the position of the second catalytic histidine in the sequence as the origin, there is a Glu residue at +3 and large hydrophobic residues (both Ile) at +5 and +6. The same motif is found in hAng, suggesting that the C terminus of RNase ZF-2 obstructs the B<sub>1</sub> subsite. This is consistent with the magnitude of its ribonucleolytic activity, which is small and similar to that of hAng.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> The specificity-determining elements of the B<sub>1</sub> subsite appear similar to those of RNase ZF-3e, while those of the B<sub>2</sub> subsite may be novel. In contrast, the sequence of RNase ZF-4 differs widely from those of RNases ZF-1–3. It is 14–16 residues shorter, with the majority of its deletions predicted to fall in loops such as those in the N-terminal, H2–B1 and B2–B3 segments. As in amphibian RNases such as ONC, the short N-terminal segment may permit the participation of Pca1 in catalysis,<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> while the B2–B3 segment appears to be abridged. The C terminus is short and hydrophilic with an Arg residue at position +3. Therefore, the B<sub>1</sub> subsite is likely to be unobstructed, as observed for RNase ZF-3e and other enzymes with an Arg/Lys in this position.<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,24,28</sup></xref> This is consistent with its elevated ribonucleolytic activity.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The specificity-determining elements of the B<sub>1</sub> subsite appear to be novel but the presence of direct counterparts of ONC residues Thr89 and Glu91 suggest that the B<sub>2</sub> subsite may be similar to that of the amphibian enzyme.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p>

The mixture was centrifuged at 13,200 g for 10 min at 4 °C, after which the <italic>A</italic><sub>260</sub> of the supernatant was used as a measure of RNase activity. The magnitude of the activity in the most linear portion of each plot (three or four data points) was used in the calculation of relative activities. [Met(–1)]-hAng (available from a previous study<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>) and RNase A (Sigma) were used as reference samples and were found to have activities in accordance with previous measurements.<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref></p>

        <p>Crystals of His-tagged RNase ZF-1a and-3e were grown at 16 °C by the hanging-drop, vapour-diffusion method. Protein solution (10 mg ml<sup>− 1</sup> in water) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (for RNase ZF-1a, 25 % PEG 4000, 0.2 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0); for RNase ZF-3e, 25 % PEG 4000, 0.2 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.5)). RNase ZF-1a formed amorphous crystals within 3 days while RNase ZF-3e formed plate-like crystals within one week. Diffraction data from single crystals were collected on stations 14.2 (RNase ZF-1a, room temperature) and 10.1 (RNase ZF-3e, 100 K) of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK), each of which was equipped with a Quantum-4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). For RNase ZF-3e, the PEG 4000 concentration in the mother liquor was increased to 30 % to provide cryoprotection. All data were processed using the HKL suite<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> and intensities were truncated to amplitudes using TRUNCATE.<xref rid="bib69 bib70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69,70</sup></xref> Matthews coefficients<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> indicated that both types of crystal contained one molecule per asymmetric unit (for RNase ZF-1a, <italic>V</italic><sub>M</sub> = 1.9 Å<sup>3</sup> Da<sup>− 1</sup> and solvent content = 35 %, v/v); for RNase ZF-3e, <italic>V</italic><sub>M</sub> = 2.2 Å<sup>3</sup> Da<sup>− 1</sup> and solvent content = 45 %, v/v). Detailed data processing statistics are given in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>
