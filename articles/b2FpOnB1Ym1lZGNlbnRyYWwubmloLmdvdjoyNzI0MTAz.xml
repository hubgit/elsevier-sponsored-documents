        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Virulence effectors delivered into intestinal epithelial cells by <italic>Salmonella</italic> trigger actin remodeling to direct pathogen internalization and intracellular replication in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles (SCVs). One such effector, SptP, functions early during pathogen entry to deactivate Rho GTPases and reverse pathogen-induced cytoskeletal changes following uptake. SptP also harbors a C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain with no clear host substrates. Investigating SptP's longevity in infected cells, we uncover a late function of SptP, showing that it associates with SCVs, and its PTPase activity increases pathogen replication. Direct SptP binding and specific dephosphorylation of the AAA+ ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), a facilitator of cellular membrane fusion and protein degradation, enhanced pathogen replication in SCVs. VCP and its adaptors p47 and Ufd1 were necessary for generating <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments on SCVs, a membrane fusion event characteristic of the pathogen replicative phase. Thus, <italic>Salmonella</italic> regulates the biogenesis of an intracellular niche through SptP-mediated dephosphorylation of VCP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>To initiate infection of humans and animals, the intracellular pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium invades nonphagocytic intestinal cells, remodeling the host actin cytoskeleton and manipulating signal transduction pathways to induce membrane ruffling and trigger pathogen uptake by macropinocytosis. Internalized bacteria then multiply in specialized intracellular endosomal compartments called <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles (SCVs) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cossart and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>). Although SCVs transiently display markers characteristic of early endosomes, e.g., Rab5 and transferrin receptor, they rapidly uncouple from the default endocytic pathway so that interaction with host lysosomes is limited and bacterial degradation is evaded (<xref rid="bib15 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Garvis et al., 2001; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999</xref>). The SCVs traffic to a Golgi-associated perinuclear position, where they intercept exocytic vesicles and fuse with late endosomes rich in LAMP1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1), achieving an intracellular niche permissive for bacterial replication (<xref rid="bib4 bib20 bib27 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Brumell et al., 2001; Kuhle et al., 2006; Meresse et al., 1999; Salcedo and Holden, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both bacterial internalization and the subsequent SCV maturation are controlled by virulence effector proteins that are delivered into host cells via specialized type III secretion systems (T3SS) encoded by two <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands, SPI-1 and SPI-2 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Galan, 2001</xref>). While SPI-1-delivered effectors are translocated during the initial entry process, those delivered by SPI-2 are expressed later in SCVs. Nevertheless, it has become evident that several SPI-1-delivered effectors persist and influence postentry events (<xref rid="bib3 bib16 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Brawn et al., 2007; Hernandez et al., 2004; Steele-Mortimer et al., 2002</xref>). We have reported that the SPI-1 actin-binding protein SipA, which promotes macropinocytosis and pathogen uptake (<xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">McGhie et al., 2001, 2004</xref>), localizes to SCVs, where it maintains the SCVs' perinuclear position (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brawn et al., 2007</xref>). The SPI-1 effector SopB also associates with vesicular membranes, where its phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase activity leads to the accumulation of PI(3)P on the SCV and enhancement of membrane fusion with other PI(3)P-containing vesicles (<xref rid="bib16 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al., 2004; Marcus et al., 2002</xref>). The SPI-1 effector SptP (<italic>Salmonella</italic> protein tyrosine phosphatase) has an N-terminal domain that functionally mimics GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) by deactivating the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and reversing the cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by the SPI-1 SopE/E2/SopB effectors to effect uptake (<xref rid="bib13 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1999; Patel and Galan, 2006</xref>). SptP translocation occurs during entry, where it downregulates membrane ruffling within 1 hr of pathogen internalization, but has also been shown to persist within host cells 3 hr after entry (<xref rid="bib13 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1999; Kubori and Galan, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>We set out to investigate whether the apparent longevity of SptP in infected cells could allow additional intracellular activity subsequent to <italic>Salmonella</italic> internalization, possibly involving the SptP C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain (<xref rid="bib18 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kaniga et al., 1996; Stebbins and Galan, 2000</xref>), for which there are no clear host targets.</p>

        <title>SptP PTPase Activity Promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> Intracellular Replication</title>
        <p>To track SptP after bacterial internalization, we generated a strain of wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, ATCC 14028, in which the chromosomal <italic>sptP</italic> gene was C-terminally fused to nucleotides encoding a 3×FLAG epitope tag (<italic>sptP<sup>FLAG</sup></italic>) to enhance detection (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>). HeLa cell infections were initiated by incubation with this strain for 1 hr, after which extracellular bacteria were killed by adding the antibiotic gentamicin, which does not penetrate HeLa cells. Host cells were lysed at intervals up to 8 hr postinfection, and T3SS-delivered SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> was detected at all time points by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). This observation confirmed and extended data (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kubori and Galan, 2003</xref>) showing that SptP persists a long time after bacterial internalization by avoiding proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A). Immunofluorescence of the infected HeLa cells indicated that SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> accumulated around 15% ± 3% of intracellular bacteria, as exemplified at the 8 hr point in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B. Further immunofluorescence microscopy showed that SptP-positive bacteria were found to reside within SCVs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). To localize T3SS-delivered SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> with more precision, we mechanically fractionated HeLa cells 8 hr postinfection and verified separation of the pellet containing plasma membranes (marked by caveolin), nuclei (histone), and bacteria (AcrB) from internal membranes (calnexin) and cytoplasm (Hsp90) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). No SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> was observed in the host cytoplasm, but it was clearly present in the pellet fraction containing plasma membranes, nuclei, and internalized bacteria and also the fraction containing internal membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The same pattern of localization was evident at the earlier time points (data not shown), showing that the persistent SptP is present at cellular membranes when bacteria reside within SCVs.</p>
        <p>It is accepted that soon after formation, SCVs fuse with vesicular membranes enriched in the late endosomal or lysosomal marker LAMP1, and from 4–6 hr after internalization, the start of intracellular replication is marked by generation of tubulovesicular <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (Sifs) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Steele-Mortimer, 2008</xref>). To assess whether SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> might influence these postinvasion events, HeLa cells were infected in parallel by wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic>, an <italic>sptP</italic> chromosomal deletion mutant (<italic>ΔsptP</italic>), and the mutant complemented with a recombinant <italic>sptP</italic> gene on a plasmid (<italic>ΔsptP</italic> pSPTP, which translocates 50% more SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> than wild-type bacteria [<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A] [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cain et al., 2004</xref>]). Infected cells were assayed for LAMP1 acquisition by SCVs, for Sif formation, and for intracellular replication. Deletion of <italic>sptP</italic> did not alter LAMP1 acquisition from that induced by the wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, closed squares versus circles), but complementing the mutant with pSPTP accelerated LAMP1 recruitment during the first 4 hr postinfection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, closed triangles). At 6 hr, Sif formation was clearly visible in 54.6% ± 1.1% of wild-type infected cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B). Although SptP was apparently excluded from Sif structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), their formation was reduced to 26.4% ± 1.1% with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> mutant and was restored to wild-type levels by complementing with pSPTP. This was mirrored in intracellular replication assayed at 8 hr (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, open squares versus circles), which was reduced from 14.3- ± 1.4-fold to 4.2- ± 2.6-fold with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> mutant, but was recovered—indeed, enhanced—to 35.2- ± 2.8-fold when <italic>ΔsptP</italic> was complemented with pSPTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, open triangles versus circles). Moreover, in each case, intracellular replication at the 8 hr point occurred within intact LAMP1-positive SCVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, closed symbols).</p>
        <p>To determine which domain of SptP is responsible for the promotion of intracellular replication and Sif generation, amino acid substitutions were introduced into the catalytic sites of the N-terminal GAP (R209A) or C-terminal PTPase (D441A) domains to specifically impair their enzymatic activity (<xref rid="bib13 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1999; Murli et al., 2001</xref>), and the corresponding expression plasmids were introduced into <italic>ΔsptP</italic>. FLAG-tagged SptP<sup>R209A</sup> and SptP<sup>D441A</sup> were associated with the pellet and internal membranes (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C), as was wild-type SptP, shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, but while both strains resided within SCVs during cell infection, only SptP<sup>R209A</sup> restored Sif formation and promoted intracellular replication (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B).</p>

        <title>SptP Binds and Dephosphorylates the Host AAA+ ATPase VCP</title>
        <p>The cellular targets of the SptP PTPase are unclear. Substrate associations with active PTPases are transient and difficult to identify (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tiganis and Bennett, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, disabling the active site of PTPases stalls catalysis and can stabilize target binding to allow the capture of trapped substrates (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Flint et al., 1997</xref>). SptP carrying the aspartate-to-alanine substitution at residue 441 was fused to GST, immobilized onto glutathione Sepharose beads, and used to probe porcine brain extract for potential host targets. Following parallel incubation of immobilized GST-SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (SptP<sup>D441A</sup>) and wild-type GST-SptP (SptP<sup>WT</sup>) with brain extract (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, upper), the beads were washed (W) and mammalian proteins eluted with extract buffer containing vanadate (V), a phosphotyrosine mimic that competitively inhibits PTPase-substrate binding (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Huyer et al., 1997</xref>). Remaining SptP was then eluted with extract buffer containing reduced glutathione (G). While SptP<sup>WT</sup> did not isolate any host protein discernable by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE, SptP<sup>D441A</sup> captured a protein migrating at approximately 100 kDa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, upper p100). Capture of this protein by SptP<sup>D441A</sup> was blocked by preincubating the brain extract with vanadate prior to addition of the beads (data not shown). The putative p100 target was isolated and identified, using mass spectrometry, as VCP (valosin-containing protein, also named p97), a eukaryotic <underline>A</underline>TPase associated with a variety of activities (AAA+ family) that facilitates disassembly of protein complexes during membrane fusion and protein degradation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2006</xref>). Immunoblotting the same fractions from the pull-down experiments with antisera against VCP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, lower) reconfirmed that the SptP<sup>D441A</sup>-bound protein was VCP, and also indicated a weaker interaction between VCP and SptP<sup>WT</sup>. When recombinant His-tagged VCP (VCP<sup>WT</sup>) was generated and incubated in binding buffer with immobilized SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), direct interaction was evident and could be disrupted with 1 M NaCl (N), demonstrating that binding requires no additional factors and probably involves charge-charge associations. To ascertain whether the SptP PTPase domain alone is sufficient for VCP binding, the GAP (residues 162–290) and PTPase<sup>D441A</sup> (residues 300–542) domains were fused independently to GST and purified. In agreement with published findings (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1998</xref>), both GST-GAP and GST-PTPase domains retained their enzymatic activity (data not shown), but neither SptP GAP or PTPase<sup>D441A</sup> was able to bind recombinant VCP<sup>WT</sup>, as shown in empty lanes (N) in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C, or endogenous porcine VCP (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To assess further whether VCP is an SptP PTPase substrate, purified VCP<sup>WT</sup> was first tyrosine phosphorylated in vitro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; VCP<sup>phos</sup>). The major site of phosphorylation in VCP is known to be tyrosine 805 (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Egerton and Samelson, 1994; Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), and VCP phosphorylation at this functionally relevant tyrosine was confirmed by marked reduction in phosphorylation when tyrosine 805 was substituted for phenylalanine to generate VCP<sup>Y805F</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; VCP<sup>phos</sup>). When phosphorylated VCP<sup>WT</sup> (2 μM) was incubated with even low picomolar concentrations of SptP<sup>WT</sup>, it was dephosphorylated, while phosphorylation of control proteins N-WASP and aldolase was unaffected, even by nanomolar concentrations of SptP<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; VCP<sup>phos</sup>, N-WASP<sup>phos</sup>, aldolase<sup>phos</sup>). No dephosphorylation of phosphorylated VCP<sup>WT</sup> was evident when incubated with SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) or individual SptP GAP and PTPase domains (data not shown).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>The SptP Substrate VCP Promotes Intracellular Replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
        <p>Our data indicate that the SptP PTPase activity promotes Sif formation and intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication, and that it can specifically dephosphorylate VCP in vitro. We therefore investigated whether the host VCP influences intracellular replication. We mechanically fractionated HeLa cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, and found (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) that VCP was present in the pellet fraction containing plasma membranes, nuclei, and internalized bacteria, as well as in those containing internal membranes and those containing cytoplasm (the same pattern was seen in noninfected control HeLa cells [data not shown]). Parallel immunofluorescence, as exemplified in the inset boxes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B), indicated that VCP localized to approximately 12% ± 4% of intracellular bacteria up to 8 hr postinfection. The low percentage of VCP-positive intracellular bacteria was similar to that seen for SptP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B); however, no colocalization was observed.</p>
        <p>To examine further the role of VCP during cell infection with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, we targeted VCP mRNA for degradation in HeLa cells by transfecting with VCP siRNA. VCP depletion was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A), and no reduction in bacterial internalization was observed in the VCP-depleted HeLa cells (data not shown). However, as when HeLa cells were infected with <italic>ΔsptP</italic> expressing pSPTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), LAMP1 recruitment by SCVs was accelerated in the VCP-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, closed symbols). From 4 hr, the number of LAMP1-positive SCVs declined in VCP-depleted cells, revealing loss of SCV integrity and bacterial release into the nutrient-rich HeLa cell cytosol, where it is accepted that <italic>Salmonella</italic> hyperreplicate (<xref rid="bib5 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Brumell et al., 2002; Perrin et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, SCV lysis following VCP-depletion coincided with increased intracellular replication (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, open symbols) and a marked reduction in Sif formation from 48% to 6% in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>B. Increased intracellular replication at 8 hr following VCP depletion was reconfirmed with distinct nonoverlapping siRNAs against VCP (data not shown).</p>
        <p>VCP is necessary for diverse ubiquitin-dependent processes in host cells. Our VCP RNAi data could indicate that VCP is required for maintaining SCV integrity. Alternatively, VCP depletion may create a poor host for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in SCVs. VCP function relies upon its association with at least two sets of major pathway-specific adaptor proteins (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2006</xref>). The heterodimeric adaptors Npl4 and Ufd1 associate with VCP during protein degradation, while VCP controls membrane fusion events via its adaptor, p47. To further examine the function of VCP during intracellular replication of wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, we depleted HeLa cells of Npl4, Ufd1, or p47 by siRNA transfection (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C), then assayed for LAMP1 acquisition, Sif formation, and intracellular replication (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Npl4, Ufd1, and p47 depletion did not affect the cellular levels of VCP (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>D) nor LAMP1 acquisition by wild-type SCVs, and bacteria remained within intact SCVs for up to 8 hr (data not shown). No statistically significant differences in Sif formation at 6 hr were observed in Npl4-depleted cells, while Ufd1 depletion reduced Sif formation from 58.2% ± 1.1% in control cells to 38.2% ± 1.2%, and in p47-depleted cells, Sif formation was retarded further to 26.7% ± 1.3% (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As observed with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), the defect in Sif formation by wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium was mirrored in intracellular replication at 8 hr (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which was reduced from 29.6- ± 1.0-fold in control cells to 14.9- ± 2.2-fold and 7.6- ± 1.2-fold in Ufd1- and p47-depleted cells, respectively.</p>

        <title>SptP Dephosphorylates VCP during <italic>Salmonella</italic> Cell Infection</title>
        <p>Next, we assessed the possibility that SptP delivered into mammalian cells specifically targets VCP. HeLa cells were infected in parallel with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> mutant or with the same mutant expressing the FLAG-tagged SptP variants listed in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B. After 4 hr, cells were lysed with detergent and SptP isolated by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Consistent with our earlier in vitro binding data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B), VCP was coprecipitated (bound) by immobilized SptP<sup>D441A</sup> lacking PTPase activity, but not equivalently tagged SptP<sup>WT</sup> or GAP-defective SptP<sup>R209A</sup>, where VCP was only present in unbound fractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Parallel immunofluorescence revealed that, unlike SptP<sup>WT</sup>, the substrate-trap SptP<sup>D441A</sup> was absent from SCVs and localized diffusely throughout the perinuclear region (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A), implying that SptP may target VCP at membranes distinct from the SCV. Other persistent (FLAG-tagged) SPI-1 effectors, SopB and SipA (<xref rid="bib3 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Brawn et al., 2007; Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>), did not bind VCP (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To demonstrate SptP-dependent VCP dephosphorylation in these cells, VCP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assessed for tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Phosphorylated VCP was evident in noninfected control cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B; VCP<sup>phos</sup>), but there was a clear reduction in the phosphorylated form in cells infected with wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. This reduction was not apparent when cells were infected with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> null mutant (−). No significant SptP-dependent changes in global cellular phosphotyrosine levels were observed, indicating specificity for VCP (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>C). When HeLa cells were infected with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>ΔsptP</italic> delivering augmented levels of plasmid-encoded SptP (pSPTP) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), dephosphorylation of VCP was enhanced substantially over that of cells infected with the wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, and this was also true following HeLa cell infection with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>ΔsptP</italic> delivering SptP<sup>R209A</sup> (pR209A). In contrast, the PTPase mutant SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (pD441A) was unable to dephosphorylate VCP.</p>
        <p>The major adaptor proteins (p47/Ufd1/Npl4) broadly determine VCP function, with the precise pathway specified by interaction with further specific coadaptors and/or substrates that can be controlled through dephosphorylation of VCP (<xref rid="bib21 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lavoie et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). For example, VCP-p47 complexes associate with the t-SNARE syntaxin5, which is a VCP adaptor involved in membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rabouille et al., 1998</xref>). The association of VCP-p47 with syntaxin5 is known to be promoted by dephosphorylation of VCP, and this leads to increased membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lavoie et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether SptP-dependent dephosphorylation of VCP promotes associations with syntaxin5 during HeLa cell infection. First, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding HA-tagged syntaxin5, which was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assessed for coprecipitated VCP by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). In all cases, VCP was predominantly observed in the unbound supernatant fraction, but VCP was also coprecipitated by immobilized syntaxin5 from noninfected controls cells (bound VCP). There was a clear enhancement in the amount of bound VCP in cells infected with wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, whereas this increase was not evident when cells were infected with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> null mutant (−). When HeLa cells were infected with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> strain delivering plasmid-encoded SptP (pSPTP), the levels of bound VCP were enhanced considerably over that isolated from noninfected control cells and those infected with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> null mutant alone.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we reveal a late function for the <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI-1 effector SptP. We show that this effector persisted for at least 8 hr after <italic>Salmonella</italic> internalization into HeLa cells, and that like the other late-acting effectors, SopB and SipA, it was located at internal membranes, including SCVs. Our initial data indicated that, in infected cells, the SptP PTPase activity promotes bacterial replication in SCVs, so we set out to identify the putative host cellular substrate(s) of the SptP PTPase. By using the D441A variant of SptP, in which the PTPase site was specifically disabled, we were able to trap a single substrate and identify it as VCP, a host AAA+ ATPase that performs a motor-like function to facilitate protein complex disassembly in diverse cellular processes (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>We showed that SptP-VCP interaction in vitro is direct, requiring no third protein, but the SptP PTPase domain alone was not sufficient to enable VCP binding and in vitro dephosphorylation. This requirement for both SptP effector domains could explain why VCP was not previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using only the isolated SptP PTPase domain (this work indicated the intermediate filament protein vimentin as a potential binding partner for SptP, but the significance of this remains unclear [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Murli et al., 2001</xref>]). The dual activities of SptP contrast to the situation in <italic>Yersinia</italic>, which has two distinct SptP homologs; the Rho GAP mimic YopE acts on Rho GTPases (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Black and Bliska, 2000</xref>), while the PTPase YopH targets tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at focal adhesion complexes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Black and Bliska, 1997</xref>). Our data indicate that fusion of the GAP and PTPase moieties is required for SptP-dependent VCP dephosphorylation, compatible with evidence from many mammalian tyrosine phosphatases that employ noncatalytic domains to mediate substrate interactions (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tiganis and Bennett, 2007</xref>), and is presumably responsible for the observed specificity of SptP. Consistent with this hypothesis, GAP-defective SptP<sup>R209A</sup> binds and dephosphorylates VCP in vitro (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
      <p>We were able to confirm that SptP specifically dephosphorylates host VCP during cell infection, and this did not occur when the PTPase active site was disabled. This dephosphorylation event appears to promote <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>A). Depleting the phosphorylated form of VCP through augmenting delivered SptP levels enhanced pathogen replication in SCVs, whereas replication of the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> strain, which is unable to dephosphorylate VCP, is impaired (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>B). We found that RNAi depletion of VCP increased intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication. However, unlike the increase seen when SptP delivery was augmented, this was due to induced SCV instability and consequent bacterial release into the nutrient-rich cytoplasm (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>C). This is not entirely surprising, as VCP depletion impairs multiple cellular processes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2004</xref>). To probe the role of VCP in SCV biogenesis more precisely, we additionally targeted the major pathway-specific adaptors through which VCP effects its myriad functions (<xref rid="bib9 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Dreveny et al., 2004; Ye, 2006</xref>). VCP promotion of Sif formation and intracellular wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication was impaired by knockdown of either the membrane fusion adaptor p47 or the protein degradation adaptor Ufd1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>D), as observed following infection with the <italic>ΔsptP</italic> strain. Although Npl4 forms a heterodimeric complex with Ufd1, we observed no effect following Npl4 depletion. This may be due to the relative inefficiency of the Npl4 RNAi knockdown. Interestingly, the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 pathway has been shown to be required for replication of the intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dorer et al., 2006</xref>). We show that <italic>Salmonella</italic> exploits both p47- and Ufd1-dependent pathways to promote SCV biogenesis.</p>
      <p>How does dephosphorylation affect VCP function? The distribution of VCP, including its recruitment to the SCV, was found to be independent of SptP (data not shown), suggesting that dephosphorylation does not influence localization. However, the sheer abundance of VCP (up to 1% of total cellular protein) means we cannot rule out subtle changes in the distribution of small subpopulations. A low proportion of SCVs localized with VCP, as was also the case for SptP, indicating that interactions with the SCV are likely transient or, alternatively, that the site of action of VCP is not the SCV itself. Indeed, we identified a significant pool of both VCP and SptP on other internal membranes that may interact with the SCV during its maturation. In addition, the substrate-trap SptP<sup>D441A</sup> was absent from SCVs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A), implying that SptP may target VCP at membranes distinct from the SCV.</p>
      <p>The activities of pathway-specific VCP-adaptor complexes are further defined by interaction with specific coadaptors and/or substrates in a hierarchical manner (<xref rid="bib9 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Dreveny et al., 2004; Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008</xref>). Over forty proteins are currently known to bind VCP, and the molecular details of these interactions are only beginning to emerge (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>). Several VCP adaptors and coadaptors whose binding is prevented by VCP phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2007</xref>) have, however, been identified. Both p47 and Ufd1-Npl4 have been shown to bind to N-terminal regions of VCP, distal to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pye et al., 2007</xref>). However, the binding of VCP-p47 and VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complexes to various coadaptors can involve the C-terminal phosphotyrosine (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Madsen et al., 2008</xref>). One such example is the interaction of VCP-p47 with the t-SNARE syntaxin5, which is known to be promoted by dephosphorylation of VCP and leads to increased membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lavoie et al., 2000</xref>). SptP may therefore manipulate VCP function by regulating its interaction with specific coadaptors. Indeed, we show that during infection, SptP-mediated dephosphorylation leads to an increase in the binding of VCP to syntaxin5. In the absence of SptP, this interaction was greatly reduced. By enhancing VCP-syntaxin5 association, SptP thus promotes fusion events within the cell that are likely crucial for the maturation and maintenance of the SCV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with the accelerated acquisition of LAMP1 observed in strains delivering augmented levels of SptP. Further work is required to determine whether any other of the plethora of VCP-interacting proteins are also regulated by <italic>Salmonella</italic> in this manner. Our findings uncover a target for the enigmatic SptP PTPase domain that reveals a mechanism by which <italic>Salmonella</italic> subverts host processes to promote the biogenesis of its intracellular niche.</p>

        <p>Mechanism for SptP Promotion of Intracellular Replication</p>
        <p>(A) SptP PTPase activity promotes intracellular replication. SptP-dependent dephosphorylation of VCP allows it to promote Sif formation and intracellular replication through the major adaptors p47 and Ufd1. SptP-dependent dephosphorylation of VCP enhances its association with pathway-specific coadaptors to determine downstream functions.</p>
        <p>(B) <italic>sptP</italic> null <italic>Salmonella</italic> are retarded for intracellular replication. Internalized <italic>ΔsptP Salmonella</italic> reside in SCVs, but VCP is not dephosphorylated. This prevents the association of VCP-p47 and VCP-Ufd1 complexes with pathway-specific coadaptor proteins and thus impairs specific VCP functions required for promoting Sif formation and intracellular replication.</p>
