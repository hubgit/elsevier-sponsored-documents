        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is a processive exoribonuclease that contributes to messenger RNA turnover and quality control of ribosomal RNA precursors in many bacterial species. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a proportion of the PNPase is recruited into a multi-enzyme assembly, known as the RNA degradosome, through an interaction with the scaffolding domain of the endoribonuclease RNase E. Here, we report crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase complexed with the recognition site from RNase E and with manganese in the presence or in the absence of modified RNA. The homotrimeric PNPase engages RNase E on the periphery of its ring-like architecture through a pseudo-continuous anti-parallel β-sheet. A similar interaction pattern occurs in the structurally homologous human exosome between the Rrp45 and Rrp46 subunits. At the centre of the PNPase ring is a tapered channel with an adjustable aperture where RNA bases stack on phenylalanine side chains and trigger structural changes that propagate to the active sites. Manganese can substitute for magnesium as an essential co-factor for PNPase catalysis, and our crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with manganese suggests how the metal is positioned to stabilise the transition state. We discuss the implications of these structural observations for the catalytic mechanism of PNPase, its processive mode of action, and its assembly into the RNA degradosome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Messenger RNA decay is the counterweight of transcription in the dynamic expression of genetic information. The regulated turnover of transcripts contributes to homeostasis and to timely and efficacious response to environmental change.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–3</sup></xref> The biological importance of transcript turnover is suggested by the conservation or essentiality of ribonuclease repertoires in all domains of life. In addition to degrading RNA, many ribonucleases have roles in the maturation and processing of structured-RNA precursors.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> One widely occurring ribonuclease with such multi-functional versatility is polynucleotide phosphorylase, a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease (PNPase; polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.8).<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,6</sup></xref> PNPase processively cleaves single-stranded RNA substrates in the 3′-to-5′ direction using inorganic phosphate to attack the phosphoester linkage at the 3′ terminus and liberate nucleoside diphosphate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Under conditions of excess nucleoside diphosphate and low concentrations of phosphate, PNPase catalyses the reverse reaction to add 3′ extensions to transcripts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a).<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7–10</sup></xref> The length of the extension on transcripts is a likely signature for turnover, since it affects stability and provides a platform for recruitment of PNPase or the hydrolytic exonuclease RNase R.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
      <p>PNPase is found in diverse species, with homologues identified in eubacteria and eukaryotic organelles such as the chloroplast and mitochondria, although curiously there is no known archaeal PNPase.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the Gram-negative bacteria <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., PNPase regulates the expression of small non-coding RNAs that control expression of outer-membrane proteins.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The enzyme also affects complex processes, such as the tissue-invasive virulence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>,<xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14</sup></xref> and the regulation of a virulence-factor secretion system in <italic>Yersinia</italic>.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, PNPase is involved in the quality control of ribosomal RNA precursors,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and is required for growth following cold shock.<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,18</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The crystal structure of PNPase from the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Streptomyces antibioticus</italic> reveals a homotrimeric subunit organisation that encloses a central channel proposed to form the pathway for RNA substrates to enter the active sites.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> A duplicated sub-domain within each protomer shares the same fold with the phosphorolytic ribonuclease RNase PH. Although each PNPase protomer potentially contains two active sites, the <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase structure suggests that only the C-terminal RNase PH domain has the capacity to catalyse phosphorolysis.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The ring-like organisation of the RNase PH-like domains seen in the trimeric PNPase is observed also in the hexameric RNase PH and the hexameric exosome assembly found in eukaryotes and archaea.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20–28</sup></xref> Crystallographic studies reveal how RNA is accommodated in the central channel of archaeal exosomes.<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23–27</sup></xref> A central channel is seen in the human exosome and is inferred to be present in the yeast exosome, but it is unclear if these engage RNA, as neither the human<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> nor the yeast exosome<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> have phosphorolytic activities; instead, the RNase PH-like subunits form a scaffolding support for S1/KH-like RNA-binding subunits and hydrolytic ribonuclease subunits.</p>
      <p>Sequence analysis suggests that the duplication of the RNase PH-like domain and the organisation of other sub-domains of <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) is conserved in PNPases across a wide range of species.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Recent crystallographic analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase corroborates the conserved sub-domain organisation.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In both the <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> crystal structures, the RNase PH-like domains are linked by a helical domain, and there are two RNA-binding domains, S1 and KH, at the C-terminus. The S1 domain is a member of the wider oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold family (the OB fold) and, like the KH domain, the S1 domain is found in many proteins that interact with single-stranded nucleic acids.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The importance of the S1 and KH domains in PNPase function has been investigated with a truncated version of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase lacking both those RNA-binding domains. This truncated PNPase, which we refer to here as the PNPase core, was found to have reduced RNA-binding affinity while retaining phosphorolytic activity.<xref rid="bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,32</sup></xref> The S1 and KH domains are inferred to interact with a stem–loop structure in the 5′ untranslated region of the PNPase mRNA, since the domains are required for autoregulation of PNPase expression.<xref rid="bib18 bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,32–35</sup></xref> These domains are required also for efficient degradation of short RNA by PNPase.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, a small proportion of PNPase is associated with the multi-enzyme RNA degradosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c).<xref rid="bib36 bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36–38</sup></xref> The other major components of the degradosome are the endoribonuclease RNase E, the DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlB (EC 3.6.1), and the glycolytic enzyme enolase (EC 4.2.1.11).<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib39 bib40 bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39–42</sup></xref> The C-terminal domain of RNase E is predicted to have little intrinsic structure aside from four recognition segments of increased structural propensity, which are referred to here as micro-domains.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> These micro-domains are predicted to recognise the other degradosome components, RNA substrates and the cytoplasmic membrane.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib43 bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43,44</sup></xref> Crystallographic studies reveal that an enolase dimer recognises one of the RNase E micro-domains (residues 833–850) by burying the cognate peptide in a deep cleft situated between the enolase subunits.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> The recognition site for PNPase has been mapped by deletion analysis<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> and encompasses a micro-domain in RNase E, corresponding to residues 1021–1061 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c). The corresponding micro-domain has been shown to interact stably with PNPase in solution.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In the current study, we solved several crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core bound to its cognate RNase E micro-domain, including a complex with O2′-methyl-modified RNA bound and another with manganese in the active site.

        <title>An overview of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core tertiary and quaternary architecture</title>
        <p>Several crystal forms were obtained for the structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core complexed with its recognition micro-domain of RNase E in the presence or in the absence of RNA substrate (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent sections will describe interactions with the RNase E recognition micro-domain, metal and RNA, and here we focus on the tertiary and quaternary structure of PNPase itself. Like the <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> homologue,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core forms a homotrimer with a ring-like architecture that encloses a large central channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a and b). An aperture is located at one end of this channel where RNA has been predicted to bind.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The two RNase PH-like domains within each protomer are spatially related by a pseudo-dyad axis, so that the PNPase trimer has approximate dihedral symmetry D<sub>3</sub>. <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase share 47% sequence identity based on structure alignment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c), and the protomers of their corresponding cores overlay with 1.6 Å root-mean-square deviation from C<sup>α</sup> positions. The protomer-to-protomer interfaces are similar for the two enzymes, as are the intra-protomer interfaces between the N-terminal and C-terminal RNase PH-like sub-domains (not shown). <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase has four inter-strand loops that are absent or truncated in the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme. Helix H4 of <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase is absent from the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). The <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPases also differ in details of the packing of the helices in the helical domain that links the two RNase PH-like sub-domains.</p>
        <p>The results of recent mutagenesis studies suggest that the helical domain contributes to PNPase enzymatic activity.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> The helical domain is well ordered in our RNA-bound crystal structure, where it is seen to form part of a pore that, in addition to the central channel, provides an accessible route to the active site. In the RNA-free form, however, the helical domain is partially disordered, which suggests that it is highly dynamic and may potentially become more structurally defined upon substrate binding. The pore to which the helical domain contributes is unlikely to be a conduit for substrates, since RNA entering through the pore may not have a favourable orientation for the 3′ end to enter the active site. Instead, this helical domain and its associated pore may affect the access of nucleoside diphosphates and phosphate into or out of the active site.</p>

        <title>Recognition of the RNase E micro-domain by the PNPase core</title>
        <p>PNPase core was co-crystallised with its RNase E recognition micro-domain (residues 1021–1061) under four different conditions, providing several independent views of the micro-domain–enzyme interaction (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The RNase E micro-domain was well resolved in the tetragonal crystal form, for which interpretable electron density was present for residues 1039–1061 in all three PNPase protomers that occupy the asymmetric unit. The backbone of the RNase E micro-domain forms hydrogen-bonding interactions with the solvent-exposed terminal ridge of an anti-parallel β-sheet within the amino-terminal RNase PH-like sub-domain of the PNPase core (residues 327–331). This interaction generates a pseudo-continuous extended β-sheet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). The remaining portion of the RNase E micro-domain that is outside the sheet region has a distorted helical conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). The RNase E micro-domain is also well resolved in the rhombohedral crystal form with Mn<sup>2+</sup> but was poorly resolved in the second rhombohedral form grown in the absence of the metal (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The location of the micro-domain on the surface of PNPase is corroborated by an orthorhombic crystal form that, while diffracting to only limited resolution (roughly 3.6 Å), has four independent PNPase trimers in the asymmetric unit that reveal unbiased density for 12 copies of the RNase E micro-domain (results not shown).</p>
        <p>Because two RNase PH-like domains of the PNPase protomer are related by an internal pseudo-dyad, there are potentially two sites within each protomer that could form an extended sheet-like interaction with the RNase E micro-domain; however, only the amino-terminal RNase PH sub-domain forms an interaction with RNase E. The observed stoichiometry of one PNPase monomer binding to one RNase E micro-domain in the crystal structures is consistent with data from mass spectrometry,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> and isothermal titration calorimetry, which show that one RNase E micro-domain binds to each PNPase protomer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The observed binding affinity by calorimetry is roughly 0.9 μM and is therefore very weak for a macromolecular interaction. The interaction may be stronger in the context of the full-length RNase E, since that molecule is a tetramer and therefore the PNPase binding sites will be spatially co-localised.</p>
        <p>An earlier study found that PNPase core and full-length PNPase bind to RNase E with roughly equal affinity.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This suggests that the missing S1 and KH domains do not affect the interaction between RNase E and PNPase, and is consistent with our observation that the bound RNase E micro-domain is not orientated to interact with the S1 and KH domains in PNPase.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the interaction between the RNase E micro-domain and PNPase closely resembles the contact made between the RNase PH-like subunits Rrp45 and Rrp46 in the human exosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). A portion of the extended C-terminal tail of the Rrp45 subunit makes a short helical segment and a β-strand that forms an extended sheet with the Rrp46 subunit.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The structural similarity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase E micro-domain-PNPase interaction and the human Rrp45-Rrp46 interaction within the exosome is likely to represent convergent evolution and highlights how the exposed peptide backbone of a β-sheet may be a favoured site for protein–protein interactions.</p>

        <title>A conformational switch accompanies RNA binding at the central aperture</title>
        <p>In our screen for well diffracting co-crystals of PNPase core with RNA, several modified RNA oligonucleotides were tested, and well diffracting co-crystals were obtain for a 12-mer RNA in which the sequence originates for a preferred cleavage site for RNase E (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The RNA is modified with O2′-methyl groups.</p>
        <p>Previously reported crystal structures of the full-length <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPases identified two constricted points in the channel.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> One of these is closer to the channel entrance and the second is deeper within the channel and nearer the active site. The entrance-proximal aperture is formed by conserved residues, corresponding to <italic>E. coli</italic> residues F77-F78-R79-R80 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a and b). This loop had been predicted to form an RNA-binding site in the PNPases of many species.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Confirming this hypothesis, our structure of PNPase in complex with RNA shows that F77 of each PNPase core monomer makes an aromatic stacking contact with an RNA base (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). The electron density in our structure is not sufficiently resolved to identify the bases, although the shape indicates that they are likely to be purines. F78 of the conserved FFRR loop supports the orientation of the base-contacting F77. The remainder of the RNA away from the stacking contact is disordered and the electron density here is poorly resolved, although it is clear that the pathway followed is along the central pore in the direction of the active site. We do not observe any interpretable electron density at the active site.</p>
        <p>Three bases are accommodated with apparent 3-fold rotational symmetry in the channel; however, these bases are likely to originate from three separate RNA oligomers and not from a continuous RNA strand, since the phosphate backbone may not accommodate the required geometry to link the visible nucleotides. Furthermore, it is unlikely that three separate oligonucleotides can be accommodated simultaneously at the aperture due to steric clashes or electrostatic repulsion of the phosphate backbone. We envisage that each potential binding site might be occupied in turn as the oligonucleotide translocates along the pore toward (or away from) the active site.</p>
        <p>The stacking of F77 on the RNA base resembles a pyrimidine/purine interaction and covers one face of the RNA base; on the opposite face, the base is contacted by G75 and S76 from the FFRR channel-loop of the neighbouring protomer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). Thus, binding of RNA requires two channel-loops and may pre-organise one of those to engage another RNA base as the oligonucleotide is translocated along the pore. The corresponding channel-loop in the human PNPase homologue has sequence YLRR, and it is likely to interact with the RNA in the same way as the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c).</p>
        <p>The FFRR channel-loops in the RNA-free <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase overlap well with the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA-bound form. However, in one of the RNA-free forms of the <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core, the FFRR loop is in a more constricted state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b). In this state, the F77 and F78 of channel-loops of neighbouring protomers stack and partially seal the channel. We note, however, that the FFRR loop may be highly dynamic in the PNPase core, because it is less ordered in the Mn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>-bound RNA-free structure, and is poorly ordered in the Shi <italic>et al</italic>. structures of the full-length PNPase and the core (PDB codes <ext-link xlink:href="3CDJ" ext-link-type="gen">3CDJ</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="3CDI" ext-link-type="gen">3CDI</ext-link>).<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Nonetheless, the aperture becomes dilated and the density becomes well defined in the RNA-bound crystal form, suggesting that the aperture switches conformation upon binding of RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b and c). The structural changes propagate to the active site (see the next section), suggesting that RNA binding might help to pre-organise the catalytic centres.</p>
        <p>The functional importance of the central aperture residues were verified earlier. Substitution of R79 and R80 in the FFRR loop (R102 and R103 in the numbering scheme used by Shi et al.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>) to alanine decreased affinity and degradation of RNA substrates,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> suggesting that constriction at this point may be involved in RNA capture. Substitution of R80 to aspartate decreases the rates of phosphorolysis and polymerisation roughly 10-fold, showing that the side chain charge is important.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> We observe that R79 and R80 do not interact with RNA directly but with other regions of PNPase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c) and suggest that these residues may have a more structural role in contributing to the engagement of RNA by the aperture.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, substitution of R83 to alanine (R106 in Ref. 29) had little apparent effect on activity but caused the full-length PNPase to stall on RNA oligomers shorter than eight nucleotides.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> This product could span the distance from the aperture to the active site. We observe that R83 is near an RNA base and, although the orientation of the side chain is not clear from the electron density map, it is anticipated to make distributive contact with the phosphate backbone of the RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). The interaction of R83 with RNA may be required for guiding RNA into the active site and perhaps supports a ratchet-like mechanical displacement of substrate into the active site for efficient degradation.</p>

        <title>Identification of manganese at the active site</title>
        <p>Earlier, the active site of <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase was identified using the phosphate analogue tungstate, which was found to be coordinated by the side-chain and main-chain atoms of T462 and S463 (corresponding to <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase residues S438 and S439; see insert of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The archaeal exosome has a phosphate at the corresponding location.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Magnesium is required for PNPase enzymatic activity, and the metal is expected to be located in the vicinity of the phosphate-binding site. We find that Mn<sup>2+</sup>can substitute for Mg<sup>2+</sup>to support catalysis (S.N. <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results), and since Mn<sup>2+</sup>can be more readily identified in difference maps and anomalous Fourier syntheses, we prepared RNA-free co-crystals of the PNPase core in the presence of 20 mM manganese acetate (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In this crystal form, a single protomer occupies the asymmetric unit, and the map revealed clear density for Mn<sup>2+</sup>at the active site. Mn<sup>2+</sup>is coordinated by the conserved residues D486, D492 and K494 (<xref rid="fig2 fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2c and 6</xref>, inset), and it is likely that magnesium will bind in a similar manner. The metal-coordinating residues D486 and D492 may act in conjunction with the bound metal to support general acid/base catalysis.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our crystallographic studies have explored three salient aspects of PNPase activity and function. The structural data show how PNPase core binds to its cognate RNase E recognition micro-domain; they show how RNA is engaged at a dynamic aperture that gates and orientates substrates to channel along the central pore to the active site; finally, they suggest how the metal-cofactor participates in the catalytic mechanism. We discuss each of these points in turn.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>RNA binding and conformational switching</title>
        <p>Our structure of the PNPase core in complex with modified RNA shows that F77 of each PNPase core monomer makes an aromatic stacking contact with an RNA base. F77 is part of the conserved FFRR loop (corresponding to <italic>E. coli</italic> residues 77–80) that forms an aperture at the mouth of the central channel near the S1/KH RNA-binding domains. Mutation of R79 and R80 from this loop affect RNA binding affinity and catalytic activity of PNPase,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and we observe that these residues help to organise the loop to bind RNA. In comparing the RNA-free structures of the PNPase core, we observe that the FFRR loop is dynamic, as we find that it constricts the pore in one apo form, but it is disordered in a second crystal form. In comparison with the constricted state of the apo form, RNA-binding is associated with a dilation of the central aperture to accommodate RNA substrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b and c). RNA binding is associated with increased conformational order that may be propagated from the aperture to the active site. We observe also that RNA binding at the aperture requires two channel-loops and may pre-organise one of those to engage another RNA base as the oligonucleotide is translocated along the pore. It is likely that the S1 and KH domains may also affect the conformational adjustments, since a comparison of the structures of full-length <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase and PNPase core in the RNA-free forms shows that the central aperture is expanded in the latter.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> As the S1 and KH domains are highly mobile in the crystal structures of both the full-length <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. antibioticus</italic> PNPase, it is difficult to envisage how these domains might communicate with the core to affect the aperture size. However, it is possible that RNA binding by the KH and S1 domains may itself contribute structural changes at the aperture.</p>
        <p>One residue that might be involved in feeding substrate to the active site is R83, which is close to the conserved FFRR aperture loop. While substitution of R83 to alanine (R106 in Ref. 29) has little apparent effect on activity, it causes the full-length PNPase to stall on RNA oligomers shorter than eight nucleotides.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> This product could partially span the distance from the aperture to the active site. We observe that R83 is near an RNA base and, although the orientation of the side chain is not clear from the electron density map, it is anticipated to make distributive contact with the phosphate backbone of RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). The interaction of R83 with RNA may be required for guiding RNA into the active site and perhaps supports a ratchet-like mechanical displacement of the substrate into the active site. In summary, we envisage a dynamic aperture at the mouth of the central channel, where binding of RNA pre-organises other potential binding sites on the FFRR loops for the translocating RNA and may pre-organise the active site as well, and in which conserved arginine residues assist the translocation. The potential of the aperture and its neighboring regions to undergo conformational changes to accommodate the RNA is likely to be a key aspect of the process by which PNPase constrains and translocates substrates in its processive mode of action.</p>

        <title>Catalytic role of metal</title>
        <p>PNPase and the archaeal exosome Rrp41 subunits catalyse the nucleophilic attack of phosphate on the terminal phosphoester bond and generate nucleoside diphosphate.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Activation is metal-dependent, and the location and activating role of metal has been inferred but not verified experimentally thus far. Our co-crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase core and Mn<sup>2+</sup>reveals that the metal is coordinated by residues D486, D492 and K494. These residues are also conserved in human PNPase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). It has been suggested that the residues corresponding to D486 and D492 have roles in the exosome to support general acid-base catalysis,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> but we suggest that they are likely to have an additional role in positioning Mg<sup>2+</sup>to activate the phosphate and to support the transition state.</p>
        <p>To examine where the metal might lie with respect to an RNA substrate, we prepared an overlay of the structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase and <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> exosome Rrp41 subunit in separate complexes with RNA or ADP (PDB codes <ext-link xlink:href="2PO1" ext-link-type="gen">2PO1</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="2PO0" ext-link-type="gen">2PO0</ext-link>, respectively).<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Notably, an overlay of the ADP and RNA-bound forms of the <italic>P. abyssi</italic> exosome shows that the scissile phosphate of RNA is spatially coincident with one of two orientations for the α-phosphate of ADP, whereas the β-phosphate is positioned at a binding site for inorganic phosphate. Strikingly, an overlay of ADP and RNA forms resembles the pentavalent phosphate transition state proposed for many phosphotransfer reactions. Guided by this overlay, a model for the transition state of an RNA substrate under attack by PNPase was prepared. Firstly, the phosphate for the transition state was placed at the mean position of the phosphate atoms in the ADP and RNA-bound forms of the <italic>P. abyssi</italic> exosome. Secondly, the oxygen atoms that formed a trigonal planar arrangement were selected from either structure to generate a chimeric structure that resembles the transition state. Lastly, we docked the chimeric RNA structure from the <italic>P. abyssi</italic> exosome structures onto the corresponding position in our PNPase core-manganese structure. The overlay shows that the metal is in a good position to support the proposed transition state (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The metal is well orientated to interact with the carboxylates of D486 and D492, and the pro-chiral, non-esterified oxygens that are in the axial position of the bi-pyrimidal transition state. In the RNA-free structure, the metal is coordinated by water molecules at the positions that correspond to the phosphate oxygens in the transition state. Metal binding is anticipated to be linked favourably with substrate binding, and the metal can have a dual role to support general acid-base catalysis involving protons originating from the water molecules of its hydration shell and to offset charge build-up in the transition state. H403 is predicted to interact with an axial oxygen (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), and substitution of this residue with alanine decreases catalytic activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase 10-fold or greater.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The residues that contact the transition state are conserved in RNase PH and PNPase of all species and in the Rrp41 subunits of the archaeal exosome, suggesting that the mechanism of metal-assisted catalysis is conserved.</p>

        <title>Interaction of PNPase and RNase E, and its implications for the RNA degradosome assembly</title>
        <p>Earlier biophysical and computational analyses have indicated that the RNA degradosome is built upon interactions of its canonical components with small peptide micro-domains lying within the C-terminal domain of RNase E.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Our earlier analysis showed that enolase recognises a separate micro-domain within RNase E, and the crystal structure of the complex reveals that the RNase E micro-domain (823–850) is situated in a cleft between the subunits of the enolase dimer,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> suggesting the binding of one enolase dimer for every RNase E monomer (S. Nurmohamed <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). Our crystallographic data presented here now reveal how one of these micro-domains from RNase E recognises PNPase core. A segment of 20 amino acids from the RNase E C-terminal domain forms hydrogen-bonding interactions with the exposed ridge of the amino-terminal RNase PH domain of PNPase in an extended β-sheet and also makes van der Waals interactions through a small helical segment. The interaction is at a distance from the active site, and it does not affect enzyme activity (S. Nurmohamed <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results).</p>
        <p>Remarkably, a similar interaction occurs between the RNase PH-like subunits Rrp45 and Rrp46 in the human exosome, where the C-terminal tail of Rrp46 plays the analogous role of RNase E micro-domain to form a pseudo-continuous β-sheet with the Rrp45 subunit. This similarity is likely to represent convergent evolution and emphasises how the exposed surface of a sheet may be a highly favoured “hot-spot” site for protein–protein interactions. Indeed, molecular recognition through peptide-sheet interaction is seen in several other protein–peptide complexes.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> The RNase E homologue of <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> has been reported to form a stable complex with PNPase<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> and, although we could not identify a sequence match with the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase E 1021-1061, we suggest that the interaction of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> RNase E and PNPase could be mediated by a sheet–strand interaction similar to that used by the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins.</p>
        <p>Using calorimetry, we observe a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of PNPase core to the RNase E micro-domain; moreover, the observed binding affinity is roughly 0.9 μM, which is weak for a macromolecular interaction. The interaction is likely to be stronger in the context of full-length RNase E, which is a tetramer, so that the PNPase binding sites will be concentrated locally. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the observed ratio of 1:1 PNPase:RNase E represents a mismatch of the molecular symmetries of the trimeric PNPase and the tetrameric RNase E. One potential resolution of the mismatch is for the formation of a greater complex of 12 subunits of both proteins, comprising three RNase E tetramers and four PNPase trimers.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Such an arrangement would satisfy all the unique molecular interactions in a self-contained assembly. Nonetheless, it is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> the degradosomes are not self-contained and are linked together in a more complex incommensurate oligomer. In such a case, the micro-domain of one degradosome is envisaged to interact with an oligomeric partner in a neighbouring degradosome. The PNPase composition of degradosomes isolated from cells can change, depending on physiological conditions,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> or in reconstituted degradosomes prepared from recombinant preparations, depending on co-purifying RNA.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> We have suggested that additional PNPase beyond the 1:1 stoichiometry might result from shared binding of RNA that links PNPase with the RNA-binding regions in the C-terminal scaffolding domain of RNase E.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Such an arrangement would envisage a dynamic and variable degradosome assembly for which the ancillary binding of additional components, including PNPase, depend on physiological conditions.</p>

For all experiments, the PNPase core concentration was 200 μM and the cell concentration of RNase E micro-domain was 10 μM. An identical titration of PNPase core into buffer and buffer into micro-domain were measured to correct the data for the heat of dilution.
