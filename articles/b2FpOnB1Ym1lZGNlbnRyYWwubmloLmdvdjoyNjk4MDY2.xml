        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Lrig1 is a marker of human interfollicular epidermal stem cells and helps maintain stem cell quiescence. We show that, in mouse epidermis, Lrig1 defines the hair follicle junctional zone adjacent to the sebaceous glands and infundibulum. <italic>Lrig1</italic> is a Myc target gene; loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> increases the proliferative capacity of stem cells in culture and results in epidermal hyperproliferation in vivo. Lrig1-expressing cells can give rise to all of the adult epidermal lineages in skin reconstitution assays. However, during homeostasis and on retinoic acid stimulation, they are bipotent, contributing to the sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis. β-catenin activation increases the size of the junctional zone compartment, and loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> causes a selective increase in β-catenin-induced ectopic hair follicle formation in the interfollicular epidermis. Our results suggest that <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells constitute a previously unidentified reservoir of adult mouse interfollicular epidermal stem cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Homeostasis in adult tissues requires balanced proliferation and differentiation. In many cases, this depends on resident stem cells that self-renew and produce the appropriate differentiated lineages of the tissue (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). Stem cells reside in unique microenvironments, niches, that are required to maintain the cells' unique properties (<xref rid="bib10 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs et al., 2004; Watt and Hogan, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mammalian epidermis comprises the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) with associated hair follicles (HF), sebaceous glands (SG), and sweat glands. There are believed to be distinct populations of stem cells in different locations. The lineages that they feed are normally constrained by signals from their local environment, but they can give rise to all epidermal lineages in response to appropriate stimuli (<xref rid="bib5 bib24 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Chuong, 2007; Jones et al., 2007; Owens and Watt, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In human IFE, clusters of stem cells have been identified on the basis of long-term self-renewal ability in culture and quiescence in vivo; these cells express a range of markers, including high levels of β1 integrins (<xref rid="bib11 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Gambardella and Barrandon, 2003; Watt, 2002</xref>). In contrast, in mouse epidermis, the best characterized stem cell population is in a region of the HF known as the bulge; these cells express keratin 15, CD34, and LGR5 and include a subpopulation of infrequently dividing, DNA label-retaining cells (LRC) (<xref rid="bib8 bib21 bib28 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Jaks et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2003; Trempus et al., 2003</xref>). Recent lineage tracing has established that mouse IFE can be temporarily reconstituted from bulge stem cells (<xref rid="bib19 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2005; Levy et al., 2007</xref>) but is maintained by actively cycling cells that divide or differentiate according to stochastic principles (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the mouse IFE stem cell compartment has proved elusive.</p>
      <p>In a screen for human epidermal stem cell markers, we identified Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). LRIG1 is a transmembrane protein that interacts with and decreases signaling by ErbB growth factor receptors (<xref rid="bib13 bib22 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Gur et al., 2004; Jensen and Watt, 2006; Laederich et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Expression of Lrig1 is required for epidermal homeostasis, as genetic deletion of <italic>Lrig1</italic> leads to epidermal hyperplasia in mouse skin (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Lrig1</italic> in cultured human keratinocytes causes increased proliferation associated with stem cell expansion (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). In cultured keratinocytes, LRIG1 negatively regulates EGF-induced ERK MAPK signaling and decreases <italic>cMyc</italic> transcription, RNA, and protein levels (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). Because epidermal overexpression of Myc can stimulate both proliferation and terminal differentiation (<xref rid="bib1 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Arnold and Watt, 2001; Waikel et al., 2001</xref>), it has been proposed that Myc-induced differentiation acts as a fail-safe device to prevent uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have now examined Lrig1 expression and function in mouse epidermis. We report that Lrig1 expression defines a previously uncharacterized multipotent stem cell population, which normally contributes to the IFE and SG lineages.</p>

        <title>Lrig1 Expression Specifies a Unique Population of Epidermal Cells during Development</title>
        <p>At E14.5, prior to HF placode formation, Lrig1 was expressed at low levels in dorsal epidermis and at higher levels by a subpopulation of dermal cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). At E17.5 and E18.5, Lrig1 expression was upregulated in the P-cadherin dim population of multipotent stem cells in the developing HF (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>) and was absent from the P-cadherin bright cells at the base (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>B, and S1F–S1H). Thus, during development, the presumptive bulge stem cell population expressed Lrig1. This expression pattern persisted at P1, except that from then onward, dermal expression was reduced (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C). Q-PCR of RNA isolated from back skin samples (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D) revealed that <italic>Lrig1</italic> levels peaked at P1.</p>
        <p>In whole mounts of tail epidermis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2003</xref>), the distinct location of the Lrig1-positive population was visualized readily at P1 and P5. β1 integrin is highly expressed by the developing hair follicle stem cell population, expression extending distally from the bulge to the HF bulb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>E). Lrig1-expressing cells in the upper part of the follicle expressed low levels of β1 integrins. By P5, tail epidermal sebaceous glands start to develop; they arose from the Lrig1-positive region of the HF and were themselves Lrig1 positive (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E, asterisk).</p>

        <title>Lrig1 Expression Defines a Distinct Population of Cells in Adult Epidermis</title>
        <p>In adult telogen back and tail epidermis (resting phase of the hair growth cycle), Lrig1 expression defined a distinct population of cells at the junction between the infundibulum and the SG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C–1F), but Lrig1 was no longer detectable in the SG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Lrig1 is the first reported marker of the junctional zone between the HF bulge, SG, and infundibulum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>I).</p>
        <p>Whereas Lrig1-positive cells in the junctional zone were present throughout the hair growth cycle, two additional sites of Lrig1 expression were found exclusively in anagen (growing) follicles. Lrig1-positive cells were detected in the outer-root sheath below the level of the SGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G, bar and asterisk), extending toward the bulge. They were also found in a ring of cells above the bulb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G, asterisk and insert).</p>
        <p>Lrig1-expressing cells in adult mouse epidermis were largely quiescent. In anagen, the zone of Lrig1 expression above the bulb separated the highly proliferative bulb cells from the rest of the outer-root sheath (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). In the junctional zone of Lrig1-positive cells, there were fewer Ki67-positive cells than in the adjacent SGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H). In late anagen, the Lrig1-positive cells below the level of the SGs included DNA label-retaining cells, another indicator of quiescence (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We compared Lrig1 expression in telogen epidermis with expression of markers previously reported to define bulge stem cells (CD34, Keratin 15, high levels of α6 integrin) (<xref rid="bib32 bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Lyle et al., 1998; Tani et al., 2000; Trempus et al., 2003</xref>). Lrig1-positive cells expressed high levels of α6 integrin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D–1F) but were negative for CD34 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). They lacked Keratin 15 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) and expressed low levels of Sca1, which is highly expressed in the infundibulum and IFE (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>Isolation of Lrig1-Expressing Cells</title>
        <p>To test the ability of Lrig1-positive cells to self-renew and contribute to different epidermal lineages, we used flow cytometry to isolate cells expressing Lrig1. The Lrig1 extracellular domain is sensitive to the trypsinization conditions normally used to disaggregate epidermal cells; however, the Lrig1 epitope was retained when cells were disaggregated with thermolysin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E and data not shown). When disaggregated epidermal cells were double-labeled with antibodies to α6 integrin and Lrig1, the Lrig1-positive population had high α6 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E), consistent with the immunolocalization data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C–1E). The specificity of Lrig1 labeling was demonstrated by frozen section and whole-mount immunostaining and flow cytometry of cells from <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null mice (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, 1F, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). As expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D), Lrig1-positive cells lacked CD34 and had low levels of Sca1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>To examine clonal growth capacity, undifferentiated, α6-positive basal cells (low forward and side scatter; all) were sorted into different fractions: α6, CD34 double-positive (CD34+); α6, Lrig1 double-positive (Lrig1+); and α6-positive, CD34, Lrig1 double-negative (CD34-Lrig1−) cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). Only the Lrig1-positive population was enriched for clonal growth ability relative to unselected α6-positive cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). Thus, Lrig1 expression defines a distinct population of highly clonogenic epidermal cells.</p>
        <p>We next analyzed RNA from flow-sorted cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G). As predicted, Lrig1-expressing cells did not express the bulge markers <italic>CD34</italic> and <italic>Lgr5</italic> (<xref rid="bib21 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Jaks et al., 2008; Trempus et al., 2003</xref>). They also lacked hair keratin 6a, a marker of cells in the bulge and outer-root sheath (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gu and Coulombe, 2007</xref>). Lrig1-positive cells expressed low levels of <italic>Sca1</italic> and the IFE-terminal differentiation marker keratin 10. Lrig1-positive cells were enriched for expression of the putative SG stem cell marker <italic>Blimp1</italic> (<xref rid="bib17 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Horsley et al., 2006; Lo Celso et al., 2008</xref>) and had higher <italic>cMyc</italic> expression than did CD34+ cells. Thus, Lrig1-expressing cells are transcriptionally distinct from bulge stem cells and committed HF and IFE cells.</p>
        <p>To allow isolation of junctional zone cells from trypsinized and <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis, we developed a second sorting strategy. Undifferentiated (low forward and side scatter) epidermal keratinocytes were sorted into six distinct populations based on CD34, α6 integrin, and Sca1 expression (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3C). Epidermal cells were divided into α6 integrin-high (I in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) or -low (II in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) populations (<xref rid="bib2 bib23 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Blanpain et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2008; Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). These two populations were each fractionated into three further groups—CD34 positive, Sca1 negative (1 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C); CD34 negative, Sca1 negative (2 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; 5 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C); or CD34 negative, Sca1 positive (3 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; 6 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C)—and RNA was isolated from all six populations. The color coding of the different populations in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C matches the colors in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D. Cells in population 2 were, as expected, enriched for <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>A–S2F) and had the same RNA expression profile as cells sorted with Lrig1 antibodies (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>D–S2F; cf. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G). We conclude that sorting CD34-negative, Sca1-negative, α6 integrin-high cells represents an alternative strategy for enriching <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells.</p>

        <title>Lrig1-Expressing Cells Can Contribute to All Epidermal Lineages</title>
        <p>To examine the capacity of Lrig1-positive cells to generate different epidermal lineages, we isolated cells on the basis of CD34, Sca1, and α6 integrin expression from mice expressing GFP under the control of the <italic>chicken β-actin promoter</italic>. The 10<sup>5</sup> sorted GFP-positive cells were combined with 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> unlabeled, unfractionated epidermal cells from a wild-type (GFP-negative) mouse. The low ratio of GFP-positive to GFP-negative cells allowed subsequent clonal analysis. The disaggregated epidermal cells were combined with P2 dermal cells, injected into a silicone chamber on the back of a nude mouse, and allowed to reconstitute skin for 4–5 weeks. We compared bulge cells (CD34 positive, Sca1 negative, α6 high) (population 1 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) with Lrig1-enriched cells (CD34 negative, Sca1 negative, α6 high) (population 2 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) and CD34-negative, Sca1-positive, α6-high cells (population 3 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), which have previously been reported to be lineage-committed IFE cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). We also isolated Lrig1, GFP double-positive cells from thermolysin-treated epidermis using Lrig1 antibodies and combined them with unfractionated, trypsin-disaggregated cells.</p>
        <p>At 4–5 weeks postgrafting, grafts were analyzed for the contribution of GFP-positive cells to SGs, HFs, and IFE. When viewed macroscopically from the dermal side, the contribution of all four populations of GFP-positive cells to HFs was evident (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E–3H). The extent of contribution of each population was similar: 6% ± 4% of HFs contained GFP-positive, Lrig1-enriched cells, compared to 1% ± 1% for CD34-positive cells and 3% ± 1% for Sca1-positive cells (n = 3 ± SEM). The number of reconstituted follicles was lower following thermolysin treatment, reflecting decreased cell viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>H and data not shown).</p>
        <p>By staining sections with GFP antibodies, we established that all four populations founded IFE clones of varying size and contributed to HFs and SGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I–3P). All HFs and SGs that contained GFP-positive cells also had a contribution of GFP-negative cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I–3L and 3P). None of the sorted populations were restricted in terms of contribution to the different HF lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I–3L and 3P).</p>

        <title>Lrig1 Expression Controls Proliferation in the Interfollicular Epidermis</title>
        <p>We next generated <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null mice by breeding heterozygous animals and compared null, heterozygous, and wild-type littermates. We saw no differences between wild-type and heterozygous animals. The tail epidermis of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null mice was thicker than that of wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B), and HFs protruded at a greater angle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D). There was no SG hyperplasia, and the hair growth cycle was not grossly perturbed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B and data not shown). Expression of Keratin 10 and Keratin 15 was normal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4I and data not shown). As reported previously, Keratin 6 was expressed in <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null IFE, consistent with epidermal hyperproliferation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; data not shown). Flow cytometry for Sca1, CD34, and α6 integrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F and 4J and data not shown) demonstrated that loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> did not affect the size of any of the six cell populations defined in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3C. Thus, loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> did not change the size of the bulge stem cell compartment or the population of cells that normally express Lrig1.</p>
        <p>The most striking phenotype was an increase in IFE proliferation. In embryonic and P1 epidermis, the effect was evident in some areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G and 4K), but the mean data from replicate samples was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>M). However, in adult skin, there was a marked increase both in Ki67-positive cells and in BrdU-labeled S phase cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>H, 4L, 4M, and data not shown).</p>
        <p>Consistent with increased epidermal proliferation, the number of DNA label-retaining cells in adult <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis was substantially reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>N and 4O). This was quantitated by flow cytometric analysis of label-retaining cells in the bulge (CD34 positive, Sca1 negative, α6 high), the cells that would normally express Lrig1 (CD34 negative, Sca1 negative, α6 high), and total undifferentiated epidermal cells (α6 positive) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>P). The number of label-retaining cells was decreased in all three populations.</p>
        <p>These results demonstrate that Lrig1 is required for stem cell quiescence in adult mouse epidermis, as observed in cultured human epidermis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lrig1 and cMyc Form an Autoregulatory Feedback Loop</title>
        <p>Activation of Myc in the basal layer of mouse epidermis results in increased proliferation (<xref rid="bib1 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Arnold and Watt, 2001; Waikel et al., 2001</xref>), whereas, in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes, LRIG1 overexpression decreases Myc levels and reduces proliferation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). There was upregulation of Myc protein and mRNA in the tail skin of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). This suggests that the increased proliferation of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis is attributable, at least in part, to increased Myc activity.</p>
        <p>To examine whether Myc activation affected <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression, we examined the epidermis of <italic>K14MycER</italic>-transgenic mice following topical application of 4-hydroxy-Tamoxifen (4OHT) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arnold and Watt, 2001</xref>). Myc activation resulted in increased <italic>Lrig1</italic> mRNA levels in telogen back skin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). There was an increase in Lrig1-expressing cells in the junctional zone, with Lrig1-positive cells extending upwards into the adjacent IFE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D–5G).</p>
        <p>Examination of ∼1.6 kb upstream of the <italic>Lrig1</italic> transcriptional start site revealed several E boxes, including a pair at 1546 and 1391 bp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H). When the upstream sequence was coupled to luciferase and transiently transfected into <italic>K14MycER</italic> keratinocytes, we observed a 4OHT concentration-dependent induction of <italic>Lrig1</italic> promoter activity when compared to normal cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Following chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of cells from 4OHT-treated <italic>K14MycER</italic> back skin, one region of the <italic>Lrig1</italic> promoter containing the two E boxes was specifically enriched in two independent biological replicates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I). As a positive control, we confirmed that the promoter of <italic>Nucleolin</italic>, a known Myc target gene, was also enriched in cMyc binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I). A genomic sequence 7 kb downstream of the <italic>Nucleolin</italic> promoter was not bound (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>I, Ctrl). In addition, knockdown of <italic>Myc</italic> expression in primary mouse keratinocytes using RNAi led to a comparable reduction in <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>J).</p>
        <p>We conclude that cMyc positively regulates <italic>Lrig1</italic> and that the two proteins are involved in a feedback loop that controls their expression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lineage Analysis of Junctional Zone Cells</title>
        <p>The phenotype of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) suggested that, although Lrig1-positive cells could contribute to all of the epidermal lineages in skin reconstitution assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), their role in epidermal homeostasis might be to maintain the IFE. To investigate this, we exploited the low stochastic leakiness associated with <italic>Keratin 14</italic> promoter-driven CreER recombination events (<xref rid="bib15 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2004; Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>K14CreER</italic> mice were crossed with <italic>CAG-CAT-eGFP</italic> (<italic>stop-flox-GFP</italic>) mice (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kawamoto et al., 2000</xref>), in which Cre-mediated recombination results in GFP expression in the descendents of each cell in which the recombination event occurred (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bleul et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Recombination mainly occurs postnatally, and from 3 months, epidermal GFP-positive clones are readily detectable.</p>
        <p>It has previously been reported that, under steady-state conditions, the IFE is primarily maintained by committed progenitors located within the IFE; however, any contribution of cells in the junctional zone or infundibulum was excluded from the analysis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>). In back skin from 4-month-old <italic>K14CreER</italic> × <italic>stop-flox-GFP</italic> animals, clones of GFP-expressing cells were detected in all epidermal regions: junctional zone, infundibulum, IFE, SG, and HF. The clones of GFP cells in the junctional zone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B) occasionally extended into the infundibulum and IFE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). To examine the response of the junctional zone population to increased IFE proliferation, we treated <italic>K14CreER</italic> × <italic>stop-flox-GFP</italic> mice with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 4 days, which preferentially stimulates IFE proliferation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Collins and Watt, 2008</xref>; data not shown).</p>
        <p>Three-dimensional reconstructions of epidermal whole mounts were analyzed with Volocity software. The size (volume) of individual GFP clones located in the junctional zone (n = 85 in control [ctrl] epidermis; n = 161 in ATRA-treated epidermis), IFE (n = 1184 ctrl, 1525 ATRA), infundibulum (n = 81 ctrl, 152 ATRA), SG (n = 53 ctrl, 80 ATRA), and HF (n = 65 ctrl, 293 ATRA) was determined, and the cumulative frequency distribution of clone sizes was plotted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). In control epidermis, the median clone size (50% ranking in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E; “+” in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H) was similar in IFE, HF, junctional zone, and infundibulum but significantly smaller in the SG (p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed unpaired Mann-Whitney test).</p>
        <p>The only category of clone to enlarge significantly upon ATRA treatment was that originating in the junctional zone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>D and 6H; p &lt; 0.05; Mann-Whitney two-tailed unpaired test). The increase was observed for all clone sizes falling between the 25th and 100th percentile (25%–100% ranking in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). ATRA treatment also resulted in the enlargement of junctional zone clones compared with ATRA-treated clones in the IFE, infundibulum, SG, and HF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>H; p &lt; 0.05). Both before and after ATRA treatment, junctional zone clones contributed cells to the infundibulum, IFE, and SG, but not to the HF below the SG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F and 6G). Conversely, HF clones never contributed to the junctional zone.</p>
        <p>These results indicate that, although Lrig1-positive cells give rise to HF lineages in skin reconstitution assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), they are bipotent in intact skin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). In response to an IFE proliferative stimulus, there is selective expansion of junctional zone clones into the IFE and SG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D).</p>

        <title>Loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> Results in Expansion of the Junctional Zone Stem Cell Compartment and Increased β-Catenin Responsiveness</title>
        <p>To examine the effects of <italic>Lrig1</italic> loss on keratinocyte growth in culture, we performed clonal growth assays on the six epidermal populations sorted on the basis of CD34, Sca1, and α6 expression from the back skin of telogen mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A). There was an increase in the colony-forming efficiency of each population and also of total basal cells (all: α6 positive, low forward, and side scatter). This is consistent with expression of <italic>Lrig1</italic> in all subpopulations of cells, albeit at different levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>E), and with upregulation of cMyc in cultured keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). However, the increase was most dramatic in the CD34-negative, Sca1-negative, α6 integrin-high population, the cells that normally are highly enriched for <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression. We conclude that, in the absence of Lrig1, this population of cells has a selective growth advantage.</p>
        <p>The expansion of clonal growth on loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> is reminiscent of the effects of activating β-catenin (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we examined Lrig1 expression in <italic>K14ΔNβ-cateninER</italic>-transgenic mice, in which β-catenin is activated by 4OHT treatment (<xref rid="bib29 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lo Celso et al., 2004; Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). β-catenin activation resulted in an increase in Lrig1-positive cells in the junctional zone and adjacent IFE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and 7C), as observed in <italic>K14MycER</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>F and 5G). Lrig1 was also expressed in ectopic follicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C, arrow and insert). There was a 2-fold increase in the α6 integrin-high, Lrig1-positive population (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>D and 7E) and a 4-fold increase in the CD34-negative, Sca1-negative, α6-high population (population 2 in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>G and S2H).</p>
        <p>Q-PCR analysis showed an increase in <italic>Lrig1</italic> mRNA in response to β-catenin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F). However, 5 kb upstream of the <italic>Lrig1</italic> transcription start site did not contain TCF- and Lef-binding sites, and Lrig1 expression was unaffected when β-catenin signaling was blocked with an N terminally truncated Lef1 transgene (data not shown). <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression was not induced in keratinocytes by Wnt3A under conditions in which known target genes, <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Jagged1</italic> (<xref rid="bib9 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Estrach et al., 2006; Lustig et al., 2002</xref>), were induced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G). In contrast, <italic>cMyc</italic>, a known target of β-catenin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1998</xref>) was upregulated upon activation of β-catenin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F). Moreover, upon β-catenin activation, there was a substantial increase in the amount of endogenous Myc associated with the E boxes on the <italic>Lrig1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>H). We conclude that, upon β-catenin activation, the Lrig1-positive compartment expands, but this reflects upregulation of cMyc because <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression is not directly regulated by β-catenin.</p>
        <p>To examine the consequences of loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> on β-catenin activation, we crossed <italic>K14ΔNβ-cateninER</italic> mice with <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null mice and examined adult tail epidermis following 4OHT treatment. On a wild-type background, 4OHT treatment induces ectopic HFs in the IFE, SGs, and existing follicles (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of β-catenin in the absence of <italic>Lrig1</italic> caused expansion of the junctional zone and a selective increase in ectopic follicles in the IFE, particularly in the vicinity of the junctional zone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>I and 7J). <italic>Lrig1</italic> loss led to some SG enlargement on β-catenin activation, but there was no increase in the number of ectopic follicles arising from the SG or existing follicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>I, 7J, 7L, and 7M).</p>
        <p>In addition to quantitating the ectopic follicles per unit length of IFE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>K), we scored epithelial cell clusters expressing CDP, an early marker of ectopic follicle formation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>N). There was an increase in CDP-positive clusters, irrespective of cluster size (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>N). Thus, <italic>Lrig1</italic> loss affects ectopic follicle number rather than size.</p>
        <p>We conclude that activation of β-catenin in the absence of <italic>Lrig1</italic> causes an increase in the number of junctional zone stem cells and that they can form ectopic HF.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have defined a distinct population of multipotent stem cells in the junctional zone of the HF that expresses Lrig1. In epidermal reconstitution experiments, these cells contribute as effectively as bulge stem cells to all of the epidermal lineages. However, lineage analysis suggests that they are bipotent in steady-state epidermis, giving rise to cells in the IFE and SG.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that, during normal epidermal homeostasis, the IFE can be maintained by committed progenitors (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>). Following wounding, bulge stem cells contribute only transiently to the IFE (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2005</xref>), whereas cells originating above the bulge stem cell compartment or in the infundibulum contribute long-term (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Levy et al., 2007</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that the junctional zone constitutes this previously unidentified reservoir of IFE stem cells. Lineage tracing demonstrates that cells in the junctional zone contribute to the infundibulum, SG, and, occasionally, the IFE. In response to ATRA, which causes IFE proliferation, there is selective expansion of junctional zone clones into these compartments. Moreover, activation of β-catenin causes a marked increase in the size of the junctional zone compartment. In <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis, this expansion is associated with a corresponding increase in the number of ectopic HFs that form specifically in the IFE adjacent to the infundibulum, but not elsewhere. This cannot simply be due to increased IFE proliferation in <italic>Lrig1</italic>-null epidermis because ATRA treatment, which stimulates IFE proliferation, does not affect β-catenin-induced ectopic HF formation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Collins and Watt, 2008</xref>; C.A.C. and F.M.W., unpublished data).</p>
      <p>The Lrig1-positive population is specified early in development, coinciding with the formation of the HF stem cell niche (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>), and persists during adulthood. Lrig1-expressing stem cells can be isolated directly via Lrig1 or enriched on the basis of high α6 integrin expression and lack of CD34 and Sca1. Cells that express Lrig1 are negative for the bulge markers keratin 6a, keratin 15, CD34, and Lgr5 (<xref rid="bib28 bib42 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2003; Trempus et al., 2003; Jaks et al., 2008</xref>). They show elevated expression of <italic>Blimp1</italic>, a previously reported marker of SG stem cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Horsley et al., 2006</xref>), and of the <italic>Lgr</italic> family member <italic>Lgr6</italic> (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2000</xref>). Expression of <italic>MTS24/Plet1</italic>, which is reported to be a marker of Sca1-negative, CD34-negative keratinocytes (<xref rid="bib23 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2008; Nijhof et al., 2006</xref>), was not specifically upregulated in Lrig1-expressing cells. Lrig1 is the first marker of the junctional zone to be described, and cells in this region have a unique gene expression profile.</p>
      <p>Lrig1 was originally identified as a human IFE stem cell marker that keeps cells in a quiescent, nondividing state (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). Consistent with those observations, loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> in mouse epidermis resulted in hyperproliferation in the IFE. <italic>Lrig1</italic> loss did not affect the HFs or SGs. In contrast, loss of the transcriptional repressor <italic>Blimp1</italic> selectively induces excessive proliferation in the SG (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Horsley et al., 2006</xref>), whereas loss of <italic>NFATc1</italic> causes continuous HF cycling (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Horsley et al., 2008</xref>). Loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic>, <italic>Blimp1</italic>, or <italic>NFATc1</italic> is characterized by reduction in the number of LRCs as they are recruited into the cell cycle. Thus, it appears that these three proteins function in concert to maintain quiescence in different epidermal stem cell compartments.</p>
      <p>We found that Lrig1 and Myc participate in an autoregulatory feedback loop; cMyc regulates transcription of the <italic>Lrig1</italic> gene, and Lrig1 negatively regulates Myc expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>). It has also been shown that Blimp1 is a direct negative regulator of Myc (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Horsley et al., 2006</xref>). This may explain why ectopic activation of Myc under the control of the keratin 14 promoter causes hyperplasia of both IFE and SG (<xref rid="bib1 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Arnold and Watt, 2001; Waikel et al., 2001</xref>), whereas loss of <italic>Lrig1</italic> specifically affects the IFE. It is interesting that Myc is required for anagen entry (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Soucek et al., 2008</xref>) because this coincides with the appearance of the ring of Lrig1-positive cells above the HF bulb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G).</p>
      <p>In epidermal reconstitution experiments, Lrig1-enriched cells and Lrig1-positive cells were as effective as bulge cells in contributing to the different epidermal lineages. Surprisingly, Sca1-positive cells, previously reported to be committed progenitors of the IFE (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>), were also capable of contributing to HFs and SGs. We suggest that the behavior of cells in different regions of the epidermis is normally constrained by signals from their local environment (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Owens and Watt, 2003</xref>). However, most, if not all, epidermal cells that are competent to proliferate will exhibit multilineage differentiation potential when challenged genetically (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>), by wounding (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2007</xref>), or in epidermal reconstitution experiments. This would certainly be consistent with recent observations on the properties of cells from different regions of the ocular surface (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Majo et al., 2008</xref>). Important questions for the future are whether all of the different epidermal stem cell populations arise from the P-cadherin-low, Lrig1-positive cells in developing HFs and whether the different stem cell populations in adult epidermis have a hierarchical relationship or are completely autonomous.</p>

        <p>Mouse keratinocytes were isolated and cultured on a J2 3T3 feeder layer as described (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). For clonal growth assays, 600 to 2500 cells were plated per well in 6-well plates and cultured for 2 weeks prior to fixation and staining with 1% Rhodamine B.</p>

        <p>Epidermal Reconstitution by Lrig1-Expressing Cells</p>
        <p>(A–C) Keratinocytes isolated from the back skin of wild-type adult telogen (7-week-old) mice were sorted into α6 integrin-high (I) and -low (II) populations (A). Populations I (B) and II (C) were gated into three further populations on the basis of Sca1 and CD34 expression, yielding a total of six discrete populations of keratinocytes (1–3 in [B]; 4–6 in [C]).</p>
        <p>(D) RNA from each of the six populations or total live cells (low forward/side scatter; all) were analyzed using Q-PCR for the genes indicated (mean ± SEM, n = 5).</p>
        <p>(E–P) Epidermal cells from telogen back skin of GFP-expressing mice were fractionated based on Sca1, α6 integrin, and CD34 expression as in (A)–(C) or Lrig1 (as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E) for epidermal reconstitution experiments by mixing GFP-positive and GFP-negative epidermal cells. Four cell populations were compared: α6 high (ItgA6H), CD34 positive, Sca1 negative (population 1; enriched for bulge cells; [E], [I], and [M]); α6 high, CD34 negative, Sca1 negative (population 2; enriched for Lrig1-positive cells; [F], [J], and [N]); α6 high, CD34 negative, SCA1 positive (population 3; [G], [K], and [O]); or Lrig1 positive ([H], [L], [P]).
