        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The control of T-cell survival is of overwhelming importance for preventing leukemia and lymphoma. The present report demonstrates that the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP4 regulates the survival of both leukemic T-cells and untransformed human peripheral blood T-cells, particularly after treatment with anti-leukemic drugs and other cytotoxic stimuli. PP4-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, through de-phosphorylation of apoptosis regulator PEA-15, previously implicated in the control of leukemic cell survival. PP4 activity significantly affects the mutation rate in leukemic T-cells, indicating that PP4 dysfunction may be important in the development and progression of leukemia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Apoptosis plays a crucial role in regulating homoeostasis in the immune system. This physiological process of cell suicide is essential for T-cell development, for the shaping of the immune repertoire and for coordinating the events leading to immune responses <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. Since the inappropriate lymphocyte survival that results from apoptosis failure is of great significance for the development of leukemia <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[1–5]</xref>, dissection of the molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis is central to understanding leukemogenesis <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. In addition, many anti-leukemic drugs act through induction of apoptosis <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[1,2,6]</xref>, so that failure of apoptosis contributes significantly to the appearance of therapy-resistant leukemic cells, particularly during relapse.</p>
      <p>Like the cell cycle, apoptosis is regulated by conserved signal transduction pathways that include many specialised activators, effectors and inhibitors <xref rid="bib3 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[3,6–8]</xref>. Genetic or functional alterations of these proteins may lead to inappropriate responses to the microenvironment, ultimately leading to cancer or autoimmunity, on the one hand, or to immunodeficiency, on the other hand <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib4 bib5 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[1,2,4,5,9]</xref>. One of the most important mechanisms by which both apoptosis and cell proliferation are regulated is the reversible phosphorylation of many proteins which affects their functions in diverse ways. These include increasing or decreasing enzyme activity, e.g. histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, translocation of proteins from one cellular compartment to another, e.g. K-Ras <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, marking a protein for degradation, e.g. IκB (Inhibitor of NFκB) <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, or promoting or inhibiting the interaction of one protein with another, e.g. BAD (Bcl-2/Bcl-X associated death promoter) <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In particular, the phosphorylation status of many pro-apoptotic (BAD, Bid and Bik) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>) Bcl-2-family proteins regulates their cellular activity, and consequently controls cell survival <xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[13–16]</xref>. The well-balanced opposing operation of protein kinases and phosphatases is therefore critical for the control of cell death and survival. Many oncogenes encode protein kinases and changes in their activity certainly contribute to the process of tumorigenic transformation <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. On the other hand, the exact roles played by protein phosphatases are much less clear, although, logically, they must be of great significance in leukemia progression through their regulation of the phosphorylation status of proteins involved in key survival and proliferation pathways. Indeed, the study of protein phosphatases and their regulation has recently become an expanding field of research, with these protein families becoming recognised as potential therapeutic targets <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mammalian serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP) family consists of the most abundant protein phosphatases PP1, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PP2B, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PP2c, PP2 (formerly PP2A) and PP2-like phosphatases such as PP6, PP5, PP7 and PP4 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Like other members of the PPP families, the ubiquitously expressed PP4 (PPP4/PPX) exists as a holoenzyme composed of a highly conserved catalytic subunit (PP4c), a structural (A) subunit and regulatory (B) subunits <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. PP4c shares 65% amino acid identity with both isoforms of PP2 catalytic subunits (PP2cα and PP2cβ), and associates with regulatory subunits which are mostly distinct from PP2 regulatory subunits <xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>. In addition to the previously identified core regulatory subunits R1 and R2, several other related variable regulatory subunits of PP4 have been identified; R3α, R3β, the eight subunit ATP-dependent chaperonin complex TRiC (also known as CCT) and the α4 regulatory subunit, which is the only subunit shared with PP2 <xref rid="bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[24–28]</xref>. It has now been recognised that PP4 regulates a variety of cellular functions independently of PP2 and it is believed that the interaction of these different regulatory subunits with the catalytic subunit PP4c is central to controlling the functional effects of this enzyme <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PP4 complexes are involved in organelle assembly, regulation of microtubule growth, cell migration, and centrosome maturation in mitosis and meiosis as well as spliceosomal assembly via interaction with the SMN complex <xref rid="bib22 bib24 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[22,24,29,30]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that PP4c regulates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity and microtubule organization via NDEL1 (nuclear distribution element 1) dephosphorylation <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. PP4 also regulates several signalling pathways, including NFκB <xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref> and the DNA damage response <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. PP4 has been reported to regulate haematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) activity in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent manner, suggesting a role for PP4 in T-cell signalling <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In addition, PP4 interacts with and down-regulates insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) following tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) stimulation <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, is involved in TNFα-induced activation of the Jun N-terminal protein kinase (Jnk) <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and has been reported to associate with HDAC3 and to inhibit its activity <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Most recently, Nakada et al. <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> have reported that depletion of PP4c results in a prolonged checkpoint arrest in human cells, suggesting that PP4c plays a critical role in dephosphorylating γH2AX after DNA damage.</p>
      <p>Emerging evidence indicates that PP4 may play important and complex roles in apoptosis and cell proliferation. Over-expression of PP4c results in an increase in cell death and a decrease in cell proliferation in mouse thymoma cells <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293T <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The present study demonstrates that down regulation of PP4c inhibits apoptosis, increases the proliferation rate, and has a strong influence on gene mutation rate, which is crucial to oncogenesis. On the other hand, PP4 appears to be essential for survival and cell proliferation because of its role in centrosome maturation <xref rid="bib29 bib42" ref-type="bibr">[29,42]</xref>. The observation that PP4 exerts inhibitory, as well as stimulatory, effects on cell growth in some situations is likely to be explained by the activity of different PP4 complexes with distinct subcellular locations and diverse substrates. These observations indicate that a certain level of PP4c activity is likely to be required for cell survival so that deletion of PP4, as well as excessive PP4, can be lethal to cells.</p>
      <p>Many studies have also implicated PP2 in the regulation of T-cell signalling, activation and survival <xref rid="bib43 bib44" ref-type="bibr">[43,44]</xref>. Proteomic analysis has shown that changes in PP4 expression levels affect the phosphorylation status of many proteins involved in apoptosis and cell proliferation, including the critical apoptosis regulators BAD and phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kD (PEA-15), which were both significantly over-phosphorylated when PP4 was suppressed <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. PEA-15 is a member of the death effector domain (DED) protein family known to control cell survival <xref rid="bib45 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[45,46]</xref>, and specific down-regulation of this protein sensitizes B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The analysis reported in the current paper is consistent with direct interaction between PP4c and PEA-15, but not between PEA-15 and PP2.</p>
      <p>Since previous experiments with mouse thymoma cells revealed a pro-apoptotic role for PP4c <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, we have extended the analysis of the effects of modulation of PP4c expression on apoptosis and cell proliferation to the human leukemic T-cell lines Jurkat and CEM-C7 and to primary human lymphocytes. These studies reveal the importance of PP4 expression levels in determining the sensitivity of both leukemic and untransformed human lymphocytes to a range of anti-leukemic drugs and other cytotoxic stimuli.</p>

        <title>Effects of PP4c over-expression on CEM-C7 and Jurkat T-cells</title>
        <p>The EST clone PP4c (accession # <ext-link xlink:href="BG913014" ext-link-type="gen">BG913014</ext-link>) was cloned directionally in pcDNA3.1 and transfected into Jurkat and CEM-C7 cells to generate stable clones selected by growth in G418. Since very similar results were obtained from both cell lines, only CEM-C7 results are shown (the Jurkat cell data are provided as <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary data online</xref>). Transfection of the PP4c expression construct into both cell lines led to the growth of 8- to 12-fold fewer colonies than vector-only transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a), reflecting the inhibitory effects of PP4c over-expression on cell growth and colony-forming ability. Three empty vector-containing clones and six PP4c-transfected clones from each cell line were further characterized. The degree of over-expression of PP4c was determined, firstly, by qRT-PCR (a 6–8-fold over-expression was observed (data not shown), and, secondly, by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). The effect of PP4c over-expression on CEM-C7 and Jurkat cell growth rate and apoptosis was examined. A significant difference in the rate of proliferation between cells transfected with PP4c and cells transfected with vector only was consistently observed. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c shows that PP4c-transfected cells proliferated at a significantly lower rate than control pcDNA3.1-transfected cells. The observed regulatory effects of PP4c were not due to clonal idiosyncrasies, since the results were also confirmed using polyclonal populations of CEM-C7 and Jurkat cells transfected with PP4c or vector only (results not shown).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the growth suppression by PP4c was due to increased apoptosis, to cell cycle arrest, or both, a cell cycle analysis was performed. The results revealed that the percentage of cells in G1 in transfected cells was considerably higher than that of the controls, suggesting that PP4c may induce arrest in G1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d), with a corresponding decrease in cells in G2/M and S phases. In addition, PP4c-transfected clones showed a substantial increase in the sub-G1 fraction, indicating that the apoptosis rate in these clones is increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d).</p>

        <title>Effect of PP4c knockdown on apoptosis and cell proliferation</title>
        <p>In order to investigate PP4c function further in CEM-C7 and Jurkat cells, we used specific siRNAs, PP4cs1 and PP4cs2, to inhibit endogenous PP4c expression in these cells. This strategy is particularly important since the effects of over-expression of any protein should be confirmed by independent methods in order to exclude possible artefacts. The effects of PP4c siRNAs were similar in the CEM-C7 and Jurkat cell lines, therefore only CEM-C7 results will be shown here (results from Jurkat cell lines are provided as <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary data</xref>). The efficiency of PP4c knockdown was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting 48 h post-transfection and the specificity of the PP4c siRNAs was tested by comparison with GAPDH siRNA and the negative control siRNA ((−)siRNA). Both PP4c-targeted siRNAs (PP4cs1 and PP4cs2) reduced PP4c mRNA levels by more than 60%. PP4cs2 was more efficient in the silencing of PP4c (70% compared to 60%; data not shown), and this degree of silencing was maintained for up to 10 days (data not shown). The scrambled negative control and GAPDH siRNAs had no significant effect on PP4c mRNA levels. PP4c down-regulation was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). Following the knockdown of PP4c, cells were grown for 4 days and their proliferation rates were assessed based on viable cell counts. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, the growth rates of CEM-C7 cells transfected with PP4cs1 and PP4cs2 were significantly increased relative to (−)siRNA-transfected cells or GAPDH siRNA-transfected cells. PI staining and FACS analysis revealed increases in S and G2/M populations in the cells transfected with PP4cs1 and PP4cs2 siRNAs compared with the cells transfected with control (−)siRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c).</p>
        <p>Since our original observation of the inhibition of apoptosis by PP4c down-regulation were made on the mouse thymoma cell line W7.2c challenged with dexamethasone and UV <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, we investigated the effects of PP4c down-regulation on Dexamethasone- and UV-induced apoptosis in CEM-C7 cells. Since induction of T-cell apoptosis through Fas/APO-1/CD95, TNFα, cisplatin, butyrate and okadaic acid has many features which are distinct from Dexamethasone- and UV-induced apoptosis, we also studied the effects of PP4c knockdown on CEM-C7 cell apoptosis induced by these stimuli. Cells were exposed to the apoptotic stimuli 48 h after transfection and apoptosis was quantified after 48 h using CaspaTag staining, which allows the detection of active caspases in live cells. Colony-forming assays, which allow the assessment of long-term survival and proliferation, were also carried out at 72 h. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows that PP4c down-regulation significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by all the stimuli tested, except for okadaic acid, in both CEM-C7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a) and Jurkat cells (see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary data</xref>) and also protected the colony-forming ability of these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary data</xref>). The effect of PP4c knockdown on Dexamethasone-induced cell death in CEM-C7 cells was interesting. Although PP4c silencing significantly protected against Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a), the protective effects on colony-forming ability were relatively small (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). Down-regulation of PP4c did not protect against okadaic acid, most likely because okadaic acid has been reported to inhibit other phosphatases in addition to PP4 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>

        <title>PP4c plays a critical role in apoptosis and cell proliferation in primary human T-lymphocytes</title>
        <p>To confirm that PP4c expression plays a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation in untransformed lymphoid cells, we manipulated the endogenous levels of PP4c expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-PP4c or with pcDNA3.1. Expression of PP4c was assessed by qRT-PCR 24 h post-transfection and was found to be increased by 4-fold (results not shown). Transfected cells were then plated for 4 days in the presence of PHA and their proliferation rate was monitored every 24 h, based on viable cell counting. Apoptosis was assessed after 24 and 48 h. PP4c-transfected cells showed a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in apoptosis relative to cells transfected with vector only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a), indicating that over-expression of PP4c by itself enhances apoptosis in normal human T-lymphocytes. Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PP4c showed a 3-fold decrease in the number of viable cells at every time point, compared to cells transfected with vector only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b), showing the inhibitory effect of PP4c on cell proliferation in primary human T-lymphocytes.</p>
        <p>The effects of PP4c down-regulation on human peripheral blood lymphocytes were also investigated. PHA-stimulated cells were transfected with control (−)siRNA or PP4c-specific siRNAs, and PP4c expression was assessed 48 h post-transfection by qRT-PCR. The level of PP4c in the cells transfected with PP4c siRNAs was decreased by 60–70% in comparison to the cells transfected with (−)siRNA (results not shown). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c shows that PP4c knockdown significantly protected T-lymphocytes from spontaneous apoptosis, reducing the level of apoptosis to less than half that in control cell populations transfected with (−)siRNAs. In addition, the number of viable cells in cultures transfected with PP4c siRNAs was significantly higher at both 24 and 48 h than the number of viable cells in cultures transfected with (−)siRNAs. This is due to both inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of the cell proliferation rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d). The increase in T-lymphocyte proliferation caused by PP4c down-regulation was confirmed by Ki67 labelling of proliferating cells <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary data</xref>).</p>
        <p>Further studies were carried out to compare the effects of PP4c with those of PP2cβ (protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit β isoform), which has previously been reported to be associated with cell death <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We have also used a functionally deficient PP4c mutant <xref rid="bib32 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[32,38]</xref> in order to ensure that the effects produced by PP4c up-regulation were due to the catalytic activity of PP4c. PHA-stimulated lymphocytes were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PP4c or pcDNA3.1, pCMVSPORT6-PP2cβ (accession # <ext-link xlink:href="BC012022" ext-link-type="gen">BC012022</ext-link>) or pCMVSPORT and the phosphatase-dead PP4c mutant in the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) (pCI-PP4-RL), in which arginine (Arg-235) in the PP4c phosphatase domain has been replaced by leucine <xref rid="bib32 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[32,38]</xref>. The expression of PP4c and PP2cβ was assessed by RT-PCR 24 h post-transfection and was found to be increased by 4.4-fold on average for PP4c and 5-fold for PP2cβ, as compared to cells transfected with empty vector. Over-expression of PP2cβ caused a decrease in viable cell number which was of a similar magnitude to that produced by PP4c, as assessed by cell counting 48 h post-transfection. Transfection with the non-functional mutant of PP4c, PP4-RL, did not have the same effect as the two catalytic subunits of PP4 and PP2, since the number of viable cells from these cultures was actually slightly higher than the number of viable cells from cultures transfected with empty vector, although the increase in cell number was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>The effects of PP2cβ down-regulation on PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes, using two specific PP2cβ-targeted siRNAs, were also investigated and compared to those of PP4c down-regulation. Transfection of PP2cβ siRNAs resulted in an average 70% decrease in the endogenous level of PP2cβ when using PP2s1 and in a 60% decrease using PP2s2, as assessed using real time RT-PCR. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a shows that down regulation of PP2cβ resulted in an increase in cell survival and proliferation. As compared to negative control siRNA, transfection with either of the two PP2cβ siRNAs produced a significant increase in viable cell number both at 48 and 72 h (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). The effects of PP2cβ down-regulation on viable cell number were similar to those produced by the knockdown of PP4c (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b). However, a remarkable difference between the effects of down-regulation of the two phosphatases was revealed when the transfected cells were incubated in the absence of fetal calf serum. Cells transfected with PP4c siRNAs were more resistant to serum withdrawal, relative to cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b), while the growth of cells transfected with PP2cβ siRNAs was similar to those transfected with control siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c).</p>

        <title>The effects of PP4c expression on T-cell survival and mutation after UV irradiation</title>
        <p>Over-expression of PP4c has been shown to decrease the mutation rate in the UV-treated embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293T <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We therefore examined the effects of PP4c on cell survival and determined the frequency of mutation at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus after UV irradiation of human leukemic T-cell lines. We compared HPRT mutation frequencies between control cells and cells transfected with pcDNA3-PP4c or PP4c siRNAs. The colony-forming ability of CEM-C7 and Jurkat cells was substantially reduced after UV exposure 40 J/m<sup>2</sup> (results not shown). pcDNA3.1-PP4c transfection enhanced the loss of colony-forming ability of these cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a). On the other hand, suppression of PP4c significantly protected from the loss of colony forming ability induced by UV (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a). We therefore analysed the production of mutant HPRT cells after UV exposure in pcDNA3.1-PP4c-transfected cells and PP4c siRNA-transfected cells. A significant decrease in the mutation rate was seen in PP4c-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b), whereas cells transfected with PP4c siRNAs showed a corresponding substantial increase in the mutation rate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). Taken together, these data further indicate an important role for PP4c in the apoptosis which normally acts to eliminate mutated cells.</p>

        <title>Interaction between PP4c and PEA-15</title>
        <p>Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kD (PEA-15) is one of the proteins that appears to be regulated, directly or indirectly, through dephosphorylation by PP4c <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In order to investigate whether PEA-15 plays a major role in mediating the apoptosis-inducing effects of PP4c, we used PEA-15-specific siRNAs to down-regulate PEA-15 and then studied the effects of modulation of PP4c expression on the viability of these cells. CEM-C7 cells were transfected with PEA-15-specific siRNAs. 48 h post-transfection, PEA-15 down-regulation was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a and data not shown), and cell viability was determined. All three siRNAs were able to down-regulate PEA-15 expression to a similar extent (60–70%; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a and data not shown). Down-regulation of PEA-15 caused a decrease in the number of viable cells and more than doubled the proportion of apoptotic cells, confirming the involvement of PEA-15 in regulating leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>c and d). 48 h post-transfection, control cells (transfected with negative control siRNA) and cells transfected with PEA-15 siRNAs were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-PP4c, pcDNA3.1 (−)siRNA or PP4c-specific siRNAs (transfection efficiency 50–60%). As similar results were obtained from all three PEA-15 siRNAs, data obtained using only one PEA-15 siRNA are shown. In the cells transfected with (−)siRNA, over-expression of PP4c caused 50% reduction in viable cell number, confirming the results obtained earlier (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>e), whereas down-regulation of PP4c caused a 50–60% increase in viable cell number (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>e). On the other hand, cells transfected with PEA-15 siRNAs showed a decrease in viable cell number in control cells (cells transfected with (−)siRNA and vector only) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>e). Over-expression of PP4c in these cells did not have any additional effect on cell viability as it was found that the viable cell number of (−)siRNA transfected cells was similar to that of PP4c transfected cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>e). However, PP4c-specific siRNAs partially reversed the effects of PEA-15 down-regulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>e). In order to ensure that the effects of PEA-15 down-regulation on PP4c function were specific, we analysed the effects of PP2cβ over-expression on PEA-15 siRNA transfected cells. Cells transfected with (−)siRNA or PEA-15 siRNAs were transiently transfected with pCMVSPORT6-PP2cβ or pCMVSPORT6, and viable cell number was determined after 24 h. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>f shows that, in contrast to PP4c, transfection of PEA-15 knock-down cells with PP2cβ led to an additional loss of viable cells, confirming that although PP4c and PP2cβ have similar effects on cell viability, their mechanisms of action are different.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report that PP4c exerts profound and specific effects on the growth and survival of both normal and leukemic human T-cells. The data presented reveal that over-expression of PP4c in the T-leukemic cell lines CEM-C7 and Jurkat inhibited their proliferation in the absence of extracellular apoptotic stimuli by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1. Our work also showed that down-regulation of endogenous PP4c by 60–70% increased the rate of cell proliferation and conferred resistance to a number of apoptotic stimuli. While down-regulation of PP4c conferred substantial resistance to UV, cisplatin and butyrate, it protected against Fas-induced apoptosis only partially. This partial inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis caused by down-regulation of PP4 may be explained in part by recognizing that, in addition to caspase-dependent pathways, Fas ligation activates other major signaling cascades that belong to the family of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways <xref rid="bib52 bib53" ref-type="bibr">[52,53]</xref>. Down-regulation of PP4c protected against Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis but was less effective in protecting against the loss of colony-forming ability. This may indicate that PP4c down-regulation protects only against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis and is less effective against the anti-proliferative effects of dexamethasone. These results suggest that PP4 may be able to modulate apoptosis in leukemic T-cells via a common factor which affects the apoptosis signaling pathways mediated by these different apoptotic stimuli. The modulation of PP4c level did not affect cell death induced by okadaic acid, presumably because okadaic acid also inhibits other phosphatases, particularly PP2, with a comparable IC<sub>50</sub> <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The critical importance of PP4c levels for the growth and survival of T-cells was further demonstrated using primary cultures of PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. As for the leukemic T-cell populations, our data show that over-expression of PP4c caused inhibition of normal lymphocyte proliferation and an increase in apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of PP4c was accompanied by a corresponding increase in proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Our results do not conflict with previous work which showed that PP4c activity is required for microtubule nucleation during centrosome maturation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and for the development of thymocytes in mice and to have an anti-apoptotic role in thymocytes <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, since these observations can quickly be reconciled by recognition of the wide range of cellular processes which involve PP4c. It is therefore likely that a minimum level of this enzyme is required for survival and proliferation. Since our analysis was inevitably focused on viable cells capable of replication and colony formation, we would not have detected any cells where the PP4 activity was below the minimum required for centrosome maturation.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have shown that PP4 regulates an increasing number of cellular functions in different cellular locations and have resulted in the identification of several PP4 regulatory subunits and binding proteins <xref rid="bib22 bib24 bib29 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[22,24,29,31]</xref>. Like other serine/threonine phosphatases, PP4 is probably targeted to its specific sites of action by these regulatory subunits and it is likely that the interchange between the different regulatory subunits and binding proteins plays a critical role in regulating the activity of PP4 complexes. It is also important to note that PP4c is a positive regulator of HPK1 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, which in turn is known to promote apoptosis of murine T lymphocytes <xref rid="bib57 bib58" ref-type="bibr">[57,58]</xref>. The possibility that over-expression of PP4c promotes apoptosis via the activation of HPK1 therefore requires further investigation.</p>
      <p>It is also believed that loss of DNA repair systems that prevent the fixation of premutagenic lesions in the genome is mandatory for carcinogenesis, since the increased mutation rates of unstable cells can give them a growth advantage over normal cells and allow them to accumulate aberrations that subsequently lead to cancer <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In the present study, we monitored the rate of mutation at the HPRT marker locus in order to study the effects of PP4c modulation on the mutation rate of leukemic T-cells. In agreement with our previous studies using HEK 293T cells <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, our results showed that over-expression of PP4c significantly reduces mutation at the HPRT locus. These effects were dependent on PP4c catalytic activity since the PP4c phosphatase-dead mutant (PP4-RL) did not affect the mutation rate of these cells (results not shown). On the other hand, down regulation of endogenous PP4c consistently increased the HPRT gene mutation frequency. These observations have important implications for oncogenesis and further support an important rate-limiting role for PP4c in the induction of apoptosis after DNA damage.</p>
      <p>PP4 shares 65% amino acid identity with PP2, the most abundant serine/threonine phosphatase in mammals <xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>, which plays a crucial role in many fundamental processes including differentiation, embryonic development, and growth control <xref rid="bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr">[60,61]</xref>. The great versatility of PP2 is a result of the existence of a large number of subunits: two isoforms of the catalytic C subunit (Cα and Cβ), two isoforms of the regulatory/scaffolding A subunit (Aα and Aβ) and numerous regulatory B subunits that fall into four families designated B, B′, B″, and <mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:msup><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>‴</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math> <xref rid="bib62 bib63 bib64 bib65 bib66" ref-type="bibr">[62–66]</xref>. In addition, PP2, PP4 and PP6 share the alpha 4 (α4) protein, the mammalian ortholog of yeast Tap42, which binds to the catalytic subunits and displaces other regulatory subunits <xref rid="bib28 bib67" ref-type="bibr">[28,67]</xref>. Several lines of evidence implicate PP2 in the regulation of apoptosis <xref rid="bib28 bib43 bib44 bib61 bib68" ref-type="bibr">[28,43,44,61,68]</xref>. However, as for PP4, the reported effects of PP2 on apoptosis and cell growth appear variable, since its function has been variously described as pro-apoptotic <xref rid="bib69 bib70" ref-type="bibr">[69,70]</xref> and as anti-apoptotic <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Functional screens of human phosphatases have identified the α isoform of PP2 catalytic subunit as associated with survival and the β isoform as associated with cell death <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Our data indicate that PP2cβ over-expression causes an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and enhances apoptosis, producing effects similar to those observed with PP4c in these cells. In addition, as with the knockdown of PP4c, down-regulation of PP2cβ increased cell proliferation. However, while PP4c knock-down conferred resistance to fetal calf serum withdrawal, reducing PP2cβ levels had little effect in this situation, indicating that each of these phosphatases acts independently on different apoptosis pathways. α4 protein, a PP2- and PP4-regulatory subunit, has been implicated in the regulation of B- and T-cell differentiation, embryonic development and cell death <xref rid="bib71 bib72 bib73" ref-type="bibr">[71–73]</xref>. Knockout of α4 decreases cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in thymocytes as well as in other cell types <xref rid="bib74 bib75" ref-type="bibr">[74,75]</xref>. α4 has been shown to interact directly with PP6, PP4c and PP2 catalytic subunits and exerts opposing kinetic effects on these target phosphatases <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It is likely that the pro-apoptotic effects observed as a result of α4 knockdown are produced by the increased activity of PP4c and/or the inhibition or activation of PP2 catalytic subunits. Further work is required to investigate the interplay between PP4c, PP2 catalytic subunit isoforms and α4 and to determine their roles in commitment to apoptosis.</p>
      <p>A multiplexed phosphorylation screen revealed that modulation of the endogenous level of PP4c in HEK 293T cells resulted in an increase or reduction in the phosphorylation state of many proteins involved in cellular stress, cellular proliferation and apoptosis <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The phosphorylation of PEA-15 was found to increase dramatically (by 223%) when PP4c expression was reduced <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. PEA-15 has been reported to modulate signalling pathways that control apoptosis and cell proliferation <xref rid="bib45 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[45,46]</xref> and to play a rate-limiting role in the induction of B-CLL cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. PEA-15 can act to modulate apoptosis and as a critical regulator of the cell cycle. Its function is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and is involved in the signalling pathways mediated by ERK1/2, Akt and RSK2 <xref rid="bib45 bib46 bib56 bib76 bib77" ref-type="bibr">[45,46,56,76,77]</xref>. In the present study, we have investigated the involvement of PEA-15 in mediating the effects of PP4c on T-leukemic cells. Down-regulation of PEA-15 reduced viable cell number, in accordance with its reported effects as an anti-apoptotic protein. PP4c over-expression in the cells which have down-regulated PEA-15 did not cause additional cell death, in contrast to the effects of PP2cβ over-expression. These observations suggest that the induction of apoptosis by over-expression of PP4c is mediated, at least in part, by the dephosphorylation of PEA-15. This highlights clear differences between the pathways which mediate the effects of PP4c and those that mediate the effects of PP2, which appear to be largely independent of PEA-15. Down-regulation of PP4c was able to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of PEA-15 knockdown, suggesting that PP4c activity is normally an important element in regulating PEA-15 activity. The interaction between PEA-15 and PP4c may therefore be critical in leukemogenesis and/or leukemia progression. The PEA-15 gene is amplified in breast cancer as well as in other cancers <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, where PEA-15 over-expression confers resistance to abroad range of anti-cancer drugs <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Since PEA-15 also confers TRAIL-resistance on leukemic cells <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, and the reistance conferred depends on the phosphorylation status of PEA-15 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, PP4 activity is likely to play an important role in regulating leukemic cell drug sensitivity. Akt, which phosphorylates and stabilises the anti-apoptotic action of PEA-15, is also upregulated in a number of human cancers <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, suggesting that they might function cooperatively in tumorigenesis. Developing strategies that enhance the activity of PP4c to oppose the effects Akt on PEA-15 could therefore prove to be effective in treating cancer.</p>

      <p>It is clear that multiple cellular functions are regulated by PP4c and its interacting proteins and that several of these are crucial to determining leukemic cell survival, particularly after treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Our findings indicate that the endogenous level of PP4c plays a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between cell survival and cell death both in normal lymphocytes and T-leukemic cells and acts, at least partly, through direct or indirect dephosphorylation of PEA-15. These observations suggest that modulating PP4c or PEA-15 function may prove important in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of leukemia.</p>

        <p>PP4c over-expression inhibits colony-forming ability, inhibits cell growth and increases apoptosis of CEM-C7 cells. CEM-C7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3-PP4c. (a) 24 h post-transfection, cells were cloned in soft agar in the presence of G418 and the number of colonies was determined after 2–3 weeks. (b) Immunoblot of PP4c expression in CEM-C7 parental cells (lane 1), pcDNA3.1-transfected CEM-C7 cells (lane 2) and pcDNA.1-PP4c-transfected CEM-C7 cells (lanes 3 and 4). Each lane contains 50 μg of whole-cell lysate subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-PP4c antibody. Anti-β-actin antibody was used to reveal β-actin as a loading control. The resulting autoradiographs were analysed by densitometry. A representative autoradiograph is presented, and the bar graphs represent means ± S.E. from four independent experiments. Relative expression is the ratio of PP4c to β-actin. (c) Growth curve of CEM-C7, CEM-C7-pcDNA3.1-transcfected cells and CEM-C7-pcDNA3.1-PP4c-transfected cells over 96 h. Viable cell density was determined by nigrosin dye exclusion.
