      <abstract>
        <p>Lake Tanganyika comprises a cichlid species flock with substrate-breeding and mouthbrooding lineages. While sexual selection via mate choice on male mating color is thought to boost speciation rates in mouthbrooding cichlids, this is not the case in substrate-breeding lamprologines, which mostly form stable pairs and lack sexual dichromatism. We present a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolution of the cichlid tribe Lamprologini, based upon mtDNA sequences and multilocus nuclear DNA (AFLP) markers. Twelve mtDNA clades were identified, seven of which were corroborated by the AFLP tree. The radiation is likely to have started about 5.3 MYA, contemporarily with that of the mouthbrooding C-lineage, and probably triggered by the onset of deep-water conditions in Lake Tanganyika. Neither the Congo- nor the Malagarazi River species form the most ancestral branch. Several conflicts in the mtDNA phylogeny with taxonomic assignments based upon color, eco-morphology and behavior could be resolved and complemented by the AFLP analysis. Introgressive hybridization upon secondary contact seems to be the most likely cause for paraphyly of taxa due to mtDNA capture in species involving brood-care helpers, while accidental hybridization best explains the para- or polyphyly of several gastropod shell breeders. Taxonomic error or paraphyly due to the survival of ancestral lineages appear responsible for inconsistencies in the genera <italic>Lamprologus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the East African Great Lakes, comprises by far the greatest diversity of cichlid fishes in terms of morphology, ecology and behavior. Its cichlid species flock includes two substrate-breeding and several mouthbrooding lineages, subdivided into 12–16 tribes (<xref rid="bib61 bib106 bib70" ref-type="bibr">Poll, 1986; Takahashi, 2003; Salzburger, 2009</xref>), which are largely supported by comparative morphological and molecular phylogenetic data (reviewed in <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>). In consequence, Lake Tanganyika contains a polyphyletic conglomerate of lineages which evolved in parallel under the same abiotic influences from a handful of ancient species that once colonized the emerging lake some 9–12 million years ago (MYA; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1993</xref>). Several new lineages formed via adaptive radiation in the lake itself, probably about 5–6 MYA when the proto-lakes fused into one single deep lake with tropical clearwater conditions (<xref rid="bib111 bib67 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tiercelin and Mondeguer, 1991; Salzburger et al., 2002a; Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>; but see <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al., 2007</xref>), and only two lineages colonized the lake at a later stage (<xref rid="bib38 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Klett and Meyer, 2002; Koch et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>With currently more than 80 species described from Lake Tanganyika (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>), the lamprologine cichlids dominate Lake Tanganyika’s cichlid fauna, comprising about 40% of the lake’s species. They are all substrate breeders and form the sister group of an equally diverse lineage of mouthbrooding species, termed the C-lineage (<xref rid="bib67 bib8 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a; Clabaut et al., 2005; Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>). Lamprologines have colonized most lacustrine habitats, but most often live in the littoral zone. Although considered a single tribe (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Poll, 1986</xref>), lamprologine cichlids encompass tremendous morphological, ecological and behavioral diversity. With respect to size and ecology, some species are large semi-pelagic predators, several are medium sized invertebrate pickers or herbivores, and some are small enough to fit into and live in empty gastropod shells (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Sato and Gashagaza, 1997</xref>). In fact, shell-breeding represents a highly successful evolutionary strategy, which was suggested to have arisen multiple times during the radiation of the lamprologines (<xref rid="bib96 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>). Remarkably, eight additional lamprologine species are found in the Congo River (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Schelly and Stiassny, 2004</xref>), and at least one species occurs in the Malagarazi River (<xref rid="bib15 bib74" ref-type="bibr">De Vos et al., 2001; Schelly et al., 2003</xref>). In terms of social organization, some species form pairs (<xref rid="bib56 bib99" ref-type="bibr">Nakano and Nagoshi, 1990; Sturmbauer et al., 2008</xref>) or harems (<xref rid="bib116 bib114 bib2 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yanagisawa, 1987; Walter and Trillmich, 1994; Awata et al., 2006; Matsumoto and Kohda, 2007</xref>), exhibit sex-role-reversed polyandry (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Yamagishi and Kohda, 1996</xref>) or are organized in family clans in which the elder offspring contribute to brood care and defense (<xref rid="bib102 bib103 bib1 bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Taborsky and Limberger, 1981; Taborsky, 1984; Awata et al., 2005; Heg et al., 2005; Heg and Bachar, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, several species exhibit alternative male reproductive phenotypes (<xref rid="bib73 bib37 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2004; Katoh et al., 2005; Ota and Kohda, 2006</xref>) and genetic parentage analyses demonstrated helper parasitism in two cooperatively breeding species (<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dierkes et al., 1999, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dierkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Awata et al., 2005</xref>), sneaker fertilization in a gastropod shell breeder (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Katoh et al., 2005</xref>), unrelated offspring in the nests of another shell-breeding species (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Sunobe and Munehara, 2003</xref>) and exceptionally high levels of multiple paternity in a socially monogamous species with biparental nest defense (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Sefc et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the monophyly of Poll’s tribe Lamprologini is firmly established (<xref rid="bib96 bib92 bib104 bib67" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Stiassny, 1997; Takahashi et al., 1998; Salzburger et al., 2002a</xref>), the intra-tribal relationships and taxonomy remain problematic and in need of revision. Morphology-based and molecular approaches have consistently been incongruent, resolving most genera as polyphyletic in molecular phylogenies (<xref rid="bib96 bib68 bib76 bib12 bib41 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Salzburger et al., 2002b; Schelly et al., 2006; Day et al., 2007; Koblmüller et al., 2007a; Nevado et al., 2009</xref>). The most thorough morphology-based analysis was carried out by <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Stiassny (1997)</xref>, in which the “ossified group of lamprologines” was defined in congruence with a mitochondrial phylogeny (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994</xref>). Ossified group lamprologines posses a sesamoid bone within the labial ligament (see Fig. 3 in <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>), which is unique among cichlids and perhaps even Perciformes. The definition of the ossified group also highlights the inadequacy of current lamprologine classification, with representatives scattered among the genera <italic>Lamprologus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>, and <italic>Altolamprologus</italic>. More recently, <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi (2003)</xref> used a partially different suite of morphological characters to examine relationships among Tanganyikan cichlids, but did not recover the ossified group as a monophyletic assemblage within 10 lamprologine species representing the Lamprologini in a broader taxonomic spectrum. A combined molecular and morphological study of <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al. (2006)</xref> addressed the evolution of the genus <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic> within the ossified group, and suggested the exclusion of <italic>Lepidiolamprologus cunningtoni</italic> and the inclusion of <italic>Neolamprologus meeli</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus hecqui</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus boulengeri</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus variostigma</italic> plus two undescribed species – one of which has been recently described as <italic>Lepidiolamprologus mimicus</italic> (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2007</xref>) – in the “two-pore” <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>-clade. <italic>Neolamprologus lemairii,</italic> which was suggested to be another potential member of the <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>-clade due to its possession of two pores in the neurocranial lateral line foramina, was resolved outside the clade (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>As substrate breeders lacking sexual dichromatism the lamprologine cichlids are an interesting test case for the driving forces of speciation, contrasting with the mostly brightly colored males in the maternally mouthbrooding C-lineage (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clabaut et al., 2005</xref>). Sexual selection based upon female mate choice on male mating color, which was suggested to be a major driving force of rapid speciation (<xref rid="bib110 bib83" ref-type="bibr">Terai et al., 2006; Seehausen et al., 2008</xref>), can be ruled out as driving force of diversification in lamprologines. On the other hand, lamprologines show other traits, which might be subject to sexual selection such as brood-care helping behavior and size dimorphism. Indeed, previous molecular phylogenetic studies on lamprologines have resulted in surprising findings: While the monophyly of genera defined by <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Poll (1986)</xref> was often corroborated in the mouthbrooding Tanganyikan lineages analyzed so far (<xref rid="bib6 bib23 bib39 bib40 bib42 bib67 bib95" ref-type="bibr">Brandstätter et al., 2005; Duftner et al., 2005; Koblmüller et al., 2004, 2005, 2007b; Salzburger et al.; 2002a; Sturmbauer and Meyer, 1993</xref>), the taxonomy of the Lamprologini appeared to be much more in conflict with five of <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Poll’s (1986)</xref> seven genera being para- or polyphyletic (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib12 bib41 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2007; Koblmüller et al., 2007a; Nevado et al., 2009</xref>). While the relatively few cases of paraphyly or polyphyly of the genera within the Tropheini, Ectodini and Limnochromini were most likely the result of ancient incomplete lineage sorting or convergent evolution of similar morphologies, repeated interspecific hybridization was suggested to be the more likely cause in the Lamprologini (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>). Due to the great degree of genetic divergence among conspecifics of <italic>Neolamprologus marunguensis</italic> belonging to different major mtDNA lineages, hybridization was put forward as the most probable explanation, in congruence with the results based on nuclear DNA data (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b</xref>). The same was found for <italic>Lepidiolamprologus nkambae</italic> (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>) and in several gastropod shell-breeding species (<xref rid="bib41 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a; Nevado et al., 2009</xref>). This problem was not adequately addressed by the most recent mitochondrial DNA phylogeny of <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Day et al. (2007)</xref>, requiring further analyses including nuclear DNA markers.</p>
      <p>In the present study we aim to resolve the phylogeny of the Lamprologini more fully by including previously omitted taxa and by applying two different sets of molecular markers - sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) genes and a set of 623 AFLP (Amplified Fragment–Length Polymorphism) loci. Furthermore, we attempt to provide a temporal framework for the diversification of this cichlid tribe by applying a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock model to estimate divergence times. Our study includes 72 of the 81described species, plus 5 undescribed species and thus represents the most comprehensive taxon sampling so far. To elucidate the relationships of lake endemics to riverine taxa, our analysis includes two species from the Congo River and another riverine species, <italic>Neolamprologus devosi</italic> (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2003</xref>), which is endemic to the Malagarazi River. To minimize potential confusion due to inadequate generic assignment against the current state of knowledge, we follow <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Stiassny’s (1997)</xref> classification, in which the Lamprologini comprise eight genera: <italic>Altolamprologus</italic> <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Poll, 1986</xref><italic>, Chalinochromis</italic> <xref rid="bib3x" ref-type="bibr">Poll, 1974</xref><italic>, Julidochromis</italic> <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boulenger, 1898</xref><italic>, Lamprologus</italic> <xref rid="bib4x" ref-type="bibr">Schilthuis, 1891</xref>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic> <xref rid="bib2x" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrin, 1904</xref>, <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colombe and Allgayer, 1985</xref><italic>, Telmatochromis</italic> <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boulenger, 1898</xref>, and <italic>Variabilichromis</italic> <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colombe and Allgayer, 1985</xref><italic>.</italic> In addition, we follow <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al. (2006)</xref> by naming all members of the “two-pore” <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>-clade <italic>N. meeli</italic>, <italic>N. hecqui</italic>, <italic>N. boulengeri</italic> and <italic>N. variostigma</italic> as <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>, and by treating <italic>L. cunningtoni</italic> as member of the still problematic genus <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>.</p>

        <title>Taxonomic sampling and DNA extraction</title>
        <p>Our study is based on 161 specimens belonging to the cichlid tribe Lamprologini. The complete ND2 gene (1047 bp) was obtained from 91 individuals representing 77 lamprologine species plus 13 outgroup taxa (four species of the tribe Eretmodini plus nine species of the C-lineage sensu <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clabaut et al., 2005</xref>; based on <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a</xref> and <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>). AFLP data were obtained from 80 individuals representing 42 lamprologine species (71 individuals) plus nine outgroup taxa (two representatives of the tribe Eretmodini plus seven individuals representing three species of the C-lineage). Due to insufficient DNA quality not all species included in the mitochondrial dataset could be included in the AFLP data. Note that only a few representatives of the ossified group lamprologines have been used for AFLP fingerprinting because a previous study (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>) explicitly dealt with the phylogenetic relationships (mtDNA + AFLPs) within the ossified group lamprologines. Most of the specimens were sampled during several field expeditions from 1995 to 2007, and some additional samples were obtained from the aquarium trade (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>). Voucher specimens are stored at the Department of Zoology, University of Graz, Austria and the Royal Africa Museum in Tervuren, Belgium. For all specimens, fin clips were taken and preserved in 99% ethanol. For DNA extraction we applied a proteinase <italic>K</italic> digestion followed by protein precipitation with ammonium acetate.</p>

        <p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), purification of PCR products, and sequencing followed the protocol described in <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Duftner et al. (2005)</xref>. The primers used for PCR and sequencing were Met, ND2.2A, Trp (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kocher et al., 1989</xref>) and ND2.T-R (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Duftner et al., 2005</xref>) for ND2. DNA fragments were purified with SephadexTM G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instruction and subsequently visualized on an ABI 373 or an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All sequences are available from GenBank under the accession numbers listed in the <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
        <p>DNA sequences were aligned by eye using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied Biosystems). To assess the overall phylogenetic signal we performed a likelihood-mapping analysis (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1997</xref>), using TREE–PUZZLE 5.1 (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2002</xref>). Phylogenetic inference was based on neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI).</p>
        <p>NJ, MP and ML were performed in PAUP∗ version 4.0b10 (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Swofford, 2002</xref>). To assess the degree of saturation of transition (<italic>ti</italic>) and transversion (<italic>tv</italic>) mutations at each codon position, we plotted the number of mutations against pairwise uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-distances (not shown). Based on the estimated <italic>ti</italic>/<italic>tv</italic> ratio inferred from these pairwise comparisons we derived a weighting scheme for a weighted MP analysis: 30:2 for third codon positions of two and three fold degenerate amino acids, 5:2 for third codon positions of four fold degenerate amino acids, 30:24 for second codon positions and 30:12 for first codon positions. C/T substitutions at the first codon position of leucine were treated as a fifth base and were down-weighted to the same weight as transitions at third codon positions. For NJ and ML analysis, we applied the best-fitting substitution model selected by Modeltest 3.06 (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Posada and Crandall, 1998</xref>): TrN + I + G (<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Tamura and Nei, 1993</xref>) with nucleotide frequencies <italic>A</italic> = 0.2640, <italic>C</italic> = 0.3656, <italic>G</italic> = 0.1220, <italic>T</italic> = 0.1484; proportion of invariable sites (<italic>I</italic>) = 0.3834; gamma shape parameter (<italic>α</italic>) = 1.1482; and <italic>R</italic>-matrix <italic>A</italic> ↔ <italic>G</italic>, <italic>A</italic> ↔ <italic>T</italic>, <italic>C</italic> ↔ <italic>G</italic>, <italic>G</italic> ↔ <italic>T</italic> = 1.0000, <italic>A</italic> ↔ <italic>G</italic> = 20.2677, <italic>C</italic> ↔ <italic>T</italic> = 6.7919. Heuristic tree searches under MP and ML criteria applied random addition of taxa and TBR branch swapping (1000 replicates for MP and 100 replicates for ML). Statistical support for the resulting topologies was assessed by bootstrapping (1000 pseudo-replicates for NJ and MP) and quartet puzzling (25,000 random quartets for ML). For BI, performed in MrBayes 3.0b4 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001</xref>), data were partitioned by codon position. Rate heterogeneity was set according to a gamma distribution with six rate categories (GTR model; <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Yang, 1994</xref>) for each data partition. Posterior probabilities were obtained from Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations (2 independent runs; 10 chains with 3 million generations each; chain temperature: 0.2; trees sampled every 100 generations). A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was constructed after a 1 million generation burn-in to allow likelihood values to reach stability (chain stationarity and run parameter convergence were checked using Tracer v1.4; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut and Drummond, 2008</xref>). To assess whether the topologies obtained by the different tree building algorithms differed significantly we performed Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH) tests (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999</xref>; full optimization; 1000 bootstrap replicates) in PAUP∗.</p>
        <p>Despite some inherent problems (e.g. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Pulquério and Nichols, 2007</xref>), time estimates based on molecular data do provide an approximate framework to put diversification events in a temporal context. Divergence times were estimated within a Bayesian MCMC framework in the program BEAST v1.4.8 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>), including the above-mentioned taxa plus additional representatives of the tribe Haplochromini (including additional taxa of the tribe Tropheini, which is nested within the Haplochromini (see <xref rid="bib69 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2005; Koblmüller et al., 2008b</xref>)), and <italic>Boulengerochromis microlepis</italic>, <italic>Bathybates leo</italic>, <italic>Hemibates stenosoma</italic> and <italic>Telotrematocara macrostoma</italic> as outgroups, justified by previously published evidence regarding the phylogenetic relationships among Lake Tanganyika’s cichlid tribes (reviewed in <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>). The inclusion of these additional taxa was necessary due to a lack of potential calibration points within the Lamprologini. Divergence times were calculated as 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals on a time-measured phylogeny. We employed the SRD06 two-partition codon-specific rates model of nucleotide evolution, which has fewer parameters than the GTR + I + G model, but has been shown to provide a better fit for protein coding sequence data (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et al., 2006</xref>) and implemented a relaxed molecular clock with log-normally autocorrelated rates among branches (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>). We used default settings for all priors except for the tree prior which was set to Yule Process (speciation) as suggested by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al. (2007)</xref>. Monophyly of clades was not enforced, except for those used as calibration points, and operators were auto-optimized. As calibration points we applied the age of 5–6 MY for the formation of a truly lacustrine habitat with clear- and deep-water conditions in Lake Tanganyika (<xref rid="bib111 bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Tiercelin and Mondeguer, 1991; Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>), constraining: (i) the time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the C-lineage encompassing the majority of mouthbrooding Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clabaut et al., 2005</xref>), and (ii) the time for the MRCA of the tribe Lamprologini, assuming that the onset of their diversification, the “primary radiation” in Lake Tanganyika, was coincident with that of the C-lineage (<xref rid="bib67 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a; Koblmüller et al., 2008a</xref>); (iii) a minimum age of 1.1 MY for the split of the Congo River lamprologines, based on the time window for a Lukuga-connection between Lake Tanganyika and the Congo system (<xref rid="bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>); (iv) a maximum age of 0.57–1 MY for the split between the utaka and mbuna cichlids, based on the age of the refilling of Lake Malawi (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Delvaux, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 2001</xref>). A preliminary run was used for parameter optimization. The final analysis was run for 10<sup>7</sup> generations, with trees sampled every 1000 generations. The log file was analyzed using Tracer v1.4 (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut and Drummond, 2008</xref>) to determine the appropriate burn-in (10<sup>6</sup> generations), which was discarded from the log and tree file. The post burn-in effective sample sizes (ESSs) for all parameters were &gt;300, indicating that the log file accurately represented the posterior distribution (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kuhner, 2009</xref>). Divergence times were calculated from the post burn-in results and TreeAnnotator v1.4.8 (a module in the BEAST program package) was used to compute a maximum-clade-credibility tree, which was visualized in FigTree v1.2.2 (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut, 2009</xref>). In order to check whether the posterior probabilities were actually affected by the data, we also ran analyses in which BEAST only sampled from the prior distribution (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>). To test for the effect of calibration points on divergence time estimates, we performed two additional analyses with different combinations of these calibration points (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Recently, alternative age estimates for the East African cichlid radiations have been proposed (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al., 2007</xref>). Applying these calibration points for the Lake Tanganyika radiation yielded age estimates that are at odds with geology-based lake history data (see <xref rid="bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a, b</xref>). To evaluate the alternatives, we applied two alternative calibration schemes: We conducted a second analysis in which we assumed an alternative age estimate of 1.1–3.5 MY for the split of the Congo River lamprologines, based on the time window for a Lukuga-connection between Lake Tanganyika and the Congo system and constrained the primary Tanganyika radiation (in our case the MRCA of the C-lineage) to an age of 9–12 million years. This was based on the assumption that the primary Tanganyika radiation had taken place at the onset of the Lake formation 9–12 MYA as a consequence of allopatric diversification in a series of small shallow lakes in the area currently occupied by the Congo River system and Lake Tanganyika (<xref rid="bib111 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Tiercelin and Mondeguer, 1991; Cohen et al., 1993</xref>). This assumption implies that the secondary radiation observed in most Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribes (<xref rid="bib39 bib40 bib41 bib42 bib47 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2004, 2005, 2007a,b, 2010; Duftner et al., 2005</xref>) coincided with the formation of a real lacustrine habitat with deep-water conditions about 5–6 MYA, compatible with the fossil calibrated diversification scenario discussed by <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al. (2007)</xref>. As a third alternative calibration, we applied a normally distributed prior with a mean of 30 MYA (S.D., 3.0 MY; to account for some degree of uncertainty in this age estimate) for the MRCA of the C-lineage, as was proposed by <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al. (2007)</xref> based on a presumed Gondwanan origin of the family Cichlidae.</p>

        <p>Restriction digestion, pre-selective and selective PCR followed the protocol described in <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Egger et al. (2007)</xref>. For selective amplification we used the following eight primer combinations: EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAA, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAG, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAC, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAT, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAA, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAG, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAC, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAT. Selective PCR products were visualized on an ABI 3100xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) along with an internal size standard (GeneScan-500 ROX, Applied Biosystems).</p>
        <p>Raw fragment data were analyzed using GENEMAPPER v.3.7 (Applied Biosystems). We found automated scoring problematic with respect to fragments that showed gradual intensity differences between samples. Because any detection threshold has to be arbitrary in such cases, presence or absence of peaks (assumed to represent homologous fragments) was scored by eye within a range of 100–500 bp (only clearly distinguishable and unambiguous peaks were scored) and assembled as a binary matrix in GENEMAPPER. In a few cases, fragments were scored as missing data when character states could not be determined unambiguously. It is clear that manual scoring yields a lower number of marker bands than automated scoring, but data quality is substantially improved by this approach. Matrices from the different primer combinations were combined into one data set yielding a data matrix of 80 individuals × 623 loci.</p>
        <p>A NJ tree based on <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Nei and Li’s (1979)</xref> distances was constructed in PAUP∗ and bootstrap values from 1000 pseudo-replicates were used as a standard measure of confidence in the reconstructed tree topology.</p>

        <p>Likelihood mapping yielded 91.2% fully resolved quartets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating a strong phylogenetic signal in the dataset. Pairwise sequence divergence (uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-distance) between lamprologine species ranged from 0.2% to 13.4%.</p>
        <p>Whereas NJ, ML and BI analyses yielded highly congruent results with only minor differences with respect to the tree building algorithm used, SH tests revealed a significantly lower likelihood value for the MP topology (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only the best tree (BI) – based on the likelihood criterion – is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
        <p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows a 75% majority-rule consensus tree based on the NJ, MP, ML and BI topologies. We present a 75% majority rule and not a strict consensus tree because of the significantly deviating MP topology (see above), which is equivalent to the strict consensus of the outcome of the remaining three tree building algorithms. Of the 1047 bp of ND2, 561 bp showed variation and 449 bp were parsimony- informative. The maximum parsimony analysis resulted in 62 most parsimonious trees (weighted tree length = 15,691 steps; CI excluding uninformative sites = 0.3994; RI = 0.6920; trees not shown). Neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference yielded the same tree topology. Our new phylogeny is fully compatible with earlier works (<xref rid="bib96 bib76 bib12 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Schelly et al., 2006; Day et al., 2007; Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>). All four tree building algorithms revealed strong support for the monophyly of the Lamprologini. Within the Lamprologini, 12 clades emerged: clade I comprising two subclades, one with <italic>Neolamprologus nigriventris</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus mustax</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus cylindricus</italic>, and the second subclade with <italic>Neolamprologus gracilis</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus savoryi</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus olivaceous</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus niger</italic> and <italic>N. marunguensis</italic> (clade I in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>); clade II comprising the very species-rich ossified group with <italic>Neolamprologus similis</italic> as its most ancestral split, followed by a subclade with <italic>Lamprologus ornatipinnis</italic>, <italic>Lamprologus kungweensis</italic>, <italic>Lamprologus laparogramma</italic> and <italic>Lamprologus signatus</italic>, another subclade with the <italic>Lamprologus speciosus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus calliurus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus brevis</italic>, a subclade with <italic>Neolamprologus multifasciatus</italic>, the subclade with <italic>Neolamprologus leloupi</italic>, the subclade with <italic>Lamprologus lemairii</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus caudopunctatus</italic>, the subclade comprising <italic>Lamprologus meleagris</italic>, the subclade with <italic>L. nkambae</italic>, the subclade containing <italic>Lamprologus ocellatus</italic>, three species of <italic>Altolamprologus</italic>, <italic>Lamprologus callipterus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus fasciatus</italic>, and the subclade comprising the members of the “two-pore” <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>-clade <italic>Lepidiolamprologus profundicola</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus elongatus</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus variostigma</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus kendalli</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus</italic>, <italic>L.</italic> sp. nov. “hecqui-boulengeri”, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus boulengeri</italic>, <italic>Lepidiolamprologus hecqui</italic> and <italic>Lepidiolamprologus meeli</italic> (clade II); clade III comprising <italic>Neolamprologus tretocephalus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus sexfasciatus</italic>; clade IV with <italic>Neolamprologus toae</italic>; clade V with <italic>Variabilichromis moorii</italic>; clade VI with <italic>Neolamprologus prochilus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus obscurus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus leleupi</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus longior</italic>, clade VII comprising <italic>Neolamprologus buescheri</italic>, clade VIII with <italic>Neolamprologus cunningtoni</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus tetracanthus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus modestus</italic>, clade IX with <italic>Neolamprologus furcifer</italic>; clade X with <italic>Neolamprologus christyi</italic>; clade XI comprising four <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> species with <italic>Julidochromis ornatus</italic>, <italic>Julidochromis transcriptus</italic> and <italic>Julidochromis dickfeldi</italic> in paraphyletic grouping; and the species-rich clade XII with five subclades, the first with <italic>Neolamprologus falcicula</italic> (clade XII.1), the second containing <italic>Neolamprologus petricola</italic>, <italic>Telmatochromis vittatus</italic>, the two Congo River species <italic>Lamprologus teugelsi</italic> and <italic>Lamprologus congoensis</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus mondabu</italic>, <italic>N.</italic> sp. nov. “eseki”, the Malagarazi River species <italic>N. devosi</italic> and <italic>Telmatochromis temporalis</italic> (clade XII.2), the third subclade comprising the brood-care helper species <italic>Neolamprologus pulcher</italic>, <italic>N. gracilis</italic>, <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus helianthus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus brichardi</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus splendens</italic> (clade XII.3), the fourth subclade with <italic>Neolamprologus walteri</italic>, <italic>Julidochromis marlieri</italic> and <italic>Julidochromis regani</italic> (clade XII.4), and the fifth subclade comprising various genotypes of <italic>N. savoryi</italic>, <italic>Telmatochromis bifrenatus</italic>, <italic>Telmatochromis dhonti</italic>, and <italic>T. temporalis</italic> (clade XII.5). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b depicts the Bayesian tree; NJ and ML yielded highly similar topologies.

        <p>For 80 taxa (representing 47 species) AFLPs could successfully be amplified. Seven out of the 12 clades corresponded to those identified on the basis of mtDNA sequences, as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>: clade II comprising the ossified group; clade III comprising <italic>N. tretocephalus</italic> and <italic>N. sexfasciatus</italic>; clade IV with <italic>N. toae</italic>; clade V with <italic>V. moorii</italic>; clade VII comprising <italic>N. buescheri</italic>; clade IX with <italic>N. furcifer</italic>; clade X with <italic>N. christyi</italic>; and clade XI comprising four <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> species with <italic>J. ornatus</italic>, <italic>J. transcriptus</italic> and <italic>J. dickfeldi</italic>. In the species-rich clade XII with five subclades, three of the five subclades were retained: subclade XII.3 comprising <italic>N. helianthus</italic>, <italic>N. olivaceous</italic>, <italic>N. savoryi</italic>, <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>, <italic>N. brichardi</italic> and <italic>N. pulcher</italic>, was retained as well as subclade XII.4 with <italic>J. marlieri</italic> and <italic>J. regani</italic>, and subclade XII.5 comprising all analyzed individuals of the three species of the genus <italic>Telmatochromis</italic>, <italic>T. bifrenatus</italic>, <italic>T. dhonti</italic>, and <italic>T. temporalis</italic>. Subclade XII.1 with <italic>N. falcicula</italic> was not corroborated due to insufficient DNA quality, subclade XII.2 represented by <italic>N. petricola</italic>, <italic>N. mondabu</italic> and the Congo River species <italic>L. teugelsi</italic>, was split into two clades. Clade VI represented by <italic>N. prochilus</italic>, <italic>N. obscurus</italic> and <italic>N. leleupi</italic> was split into three separate clades, clade VIII with <italic>N. cunningtoni</italic>, <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic> and <italic>N. modestus</italic> was split into one clade comprising <italic>N. cunningtoni</italic> and <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic>, a second with <italic>N. modestus</italic>. In summary, the AFLP tree was highly compatible with the mtDNA phylogeny by corroborating 7 of the 12 clades with good bootstrap support. The remaining 5 mtDNA clades were subdivided. As in the mtDNA phylogeny, most branches between clades were short. In contrast to the mtDNA tree, however, all species recovered as polyphyletic in the mtDNA phylogeny were monophyletic in the AFLP tree. Moreover, the genus <italic>Telmatochromis</italic>, which was scattered in the mtDNA tree, was monophyletic in the AFLP analysis, as were the <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> species with brood-care helper behavior of clade XII.3.

        <title>Mitochondrial phylo-chronology</title>
        <p>The chronogram for the radiation of the lamprologine cichlids resulting from a relaxed molecular clock analysis with BEAST and applying four calibration points ((i) MRCA of the C-lineage; (ii) MRCA of the Malawi cichlid species flock; (iii) MRCA of the Lamprologini; (iv) time window for the colonization of the Congo system via the Lukuga River) is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (chronograms based on alternative sets of calibration points are shown in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1–4</xref>). For all calibration nodes in all analyses, mean posterior estimates were close to prior node ages (but usually with smaller HPD intervals), indicating that the combinations of calibration points are reasonably concordant (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Sanders and Lee, 2007</xref>). The mean rate covariance was slightly negative in all analyses, with its 95% HPD interval spanning zero (not shown), indicating that branches with fast and slow substitution rates are next to each other, meaning that there is no strong evidence for autocorrelation of rates in the phylogeny (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>). All calibration sets yielded similar significant but not exceptionally high levels of rate heterogeneity among lineages (mean coefficients of branch rate variation, 0.32–0.34; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), thus justifying the use of a relaxed clock model (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2007</xref>). Mean substitution rates varied between 0.01597 and 0.01794 substitutions per site per MY among the analyses assuming that the primary radiation (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a</xref>) coincided with the formation of a real lacustrine habitat 5–6 MYA (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Analyses assuming ages of 9–12 and 30 MY for the diversification of the C-lineage yielded mean substitution rates of 0.00919 and 0.00317 substitutions per site per MY, respectively (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We emphasize that our divergence time estimates should be regarded as approximate, because the 95% HPD intervals of adjacent nodes are large and often overlapping.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the diversification of both the C-lineage and the Lamprologini started in the course of the so-called “primary radiation”, which was proposed to have coincided with the formation of tropical clearwater habitat with deep-water conditions 5–6 MYA (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a</xref>), the Lamprologini were estimated to have diverged from the Eretmodini and the C-lineage approximately 7.5 MYA. The onset of diversification within the Lamprologini was estimated to ∼5.3 MYA. Note that this estimate was heavily constrained by applying a uniform prior of 5–6 MYA for this particular node. In the course of this first cladogenesis event at the base of the lamprologine radiation, clades I and II (ossified group), as well as the ancestor of clades III–XII emerged. The ancestor of the species poor clades III (<italic>N. toae</italic>) and IV (<italic>N. sexfasciatus </italic>+ <italic>N. tretocephalus</italic>) branched off ∼4.8 MYA and the split between these two lineages happened ∼4.2 MYA. The next clade to diverge was clade V (<italic>V. moorii</italic>) at ∼4.4 MYA, followed by clade VI ∼4 MYA. The split between the ancestor of clades VII–XI and clade XII happened ∼3.7 MYA. The mostly species poor lineages VII–XI, diverged in subsequent order ∼3.4, ∼2.9, ∼2.6 and ∼2.3 MYA. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the <italic>Chalinochromis</italic>/<italic>Julidochromis</italic> species in clade XI dates back to ∼1.2 MYA. The split of the Congo River lamprologines from the closet related Lake Tanganyika species (<italic>T. vittatus</italic>) was estimated at ∼1.7 MYA, which lies well within the possible time window of 1.1–3.5 MYA for the connection of Lake Tanganyika with the Congo system (<xref rid="bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>N. devosi</italic>, which occurs in the Malagarazi River, diverged from its Lake Tanganyika sister taxon ∼1.2 MYA. Taking together this series of cladogenesis events, the radiation of the Lamprologini seems to have happened more gradually than that of Lake Tanganyika’s mouthbrooding cichlid lineages (<xref rid="bib67 bib98 bib6 bib39 bib40 bib42 bib47 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a; Sturmbauer et al., 2003; Brandstätter et al., 2005; Koblmüller et al., 2004, 2005, 2007b, 2010; Duftner et al., 2005</xref>). Estimates without prior constraints on the MRCA of the Lamprologini revealed only slightly more recent age estimates for splits within the Lamprologini, but confidence intervals were largely overlapping with the results of the analysis in which we constrained the MRCA of the Lamprologini to an age of 5–6 MYA. Likewise, using a prior on the time window for a possible colonization of the Congo system via the Lukuga River had little effect on the resulting age estimates. The alternative calibrations, congruent with <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al.’s (2007)</xref> fossil calibrated and Gondwanan based scenarios for cichlid diversification yielded roughly two and five times older node ages, respectively (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</xref>).</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most intriguing question connected to the diversification of the Lamprologini is the role of sexual selection. While this is considered highly important in mouthbrooding cichlid lineages (<xref rid="bib19 bib82 bib110 bib83 bib70" ref-type="bibr">Dominey, 1984; Seehausen, 2000; Terai et al., 2006; Seehausen et al., 2008; Salzburger, 2009</xref>), substrate-breeding species with pair-formation lack many features associated with sexual selection as a diversifying force. Unlike haplochromines and several other mouthbrooding cichlid tribes, lamprologine cichlids never display pronounced sexual dichromatism upon which sexual selection via mate choice might act (<xref rid="bib78 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schluter and Price, 1993; Gray and McKinnon, 2007</xref>), indicating that color is not their basis for mate choice. However, while mating color can be ruled out as an important factor facilitating “proper” mate choice and driving reproductive isolation and speciation in this group, this may not be the case for other male-specific traits such as larger body size and territory quality and size. In fact, sexual size dimorphism is quite frequently observed in lamprologines, with males typically slightly larger than females, so that positive selection on male body size facilitating territorial defense seems likely (see e.g. <xref rid="bib80 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Schütz et al., 2006; Maan and Taborsky, 2008</xref>). However, the most pronounced cases of sexual size dimorphism are observed in some obligatory and facultative gastropod shell breeders (<italic>L. callipterus</italic>, <italic>L. lemairii</italic>, <italic>L. ornatipinnis</italic>, <italic>N. calliurus</italic>, <italic>N. fasciatus</italic>). In <italic>L. callipterus</italic>, <italic>L. lemairii</italic> (some females appear to reach maturity at a body size small enough to spawn in gastropod shells) and <italic>N. fasciatus</italic>, females are small enough to fit in a <italic>Neothauma</italic> shell, while males are too large to enter the shells and thus have to release their sperm over the shell entrance. In <italic>L. callipterus</italic> an alterative reproductive tactic evolved, with dwarf males that are even smaller than females and thus able to enter the shells to fertilize the eggs, even in the presence of the large territorial male. The point may be that male color traits can be pushed by diversifying sexual selection which is not the case for male fitness traits, so that selection acting on those cannot easily lead to two novel species in sympatry. However, divergent selection acting on polymorphic and naturally selected traits relevant for differential trophic specialization, as described for Central American cichlids (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barluenga and Meyer, 2004</xref>), may as well have promoted (sympatric) speciation in lamprologines.</p>
      <p>Sexual selection can also act in social context, to produce signals for intraspecific communication. This is the case in lamprologines with brood-care helper behavior which often show individual color markings on the head or body. The <italic>N. pulcher</italic> group and perhaps the genus <italic>Julidochromis</italic> may serve as examples. The subclade comprising the <italic>N. pulcher</italic> group with species exhibiting sophisticated brood-care helping behavior is monophyletic according to our AFLP phylogeny (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and species-rich. All species display distinct color patterns on the head which are species-specific, albeit variable enough that individuals can be distinguished (<xref rid="bib34 bib3 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hert, 1985; Balshine-Earn and Lotem, 1998; Frostman and Sherman, 2004</xref>). It thus seems likely that the “head mask” facilitates social interactions and is thus subject to sexual selection. As most of these species are allopatric, maintenance and evolution of color in this group may be similar to the pattern found in the maternal mouthbrooding genus <italic>Tropheus</italic>, for which about 120 distinctly colored populations or sister species were described. As in the <italic>N. pulcher</italic> group, no sexual color dimorphism exists in <italic>Tropheus</italic>, and most color morphs are allopatric, so that divergent selection in sympatry seems unlikely as driving force of speciation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Egger et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, disruptive sexual selection does not seem to be frequent in the Lamprologini, albeit other diversifying selective processes in social context might exist, in addition to those in the context of natural selection (see also <xref rid="bib112 bib107" ref-type="bibr">Verburg and Bills, 2007; Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). These might help to explain why the Lamprologini are the only non-mouthbrooding cichlid lineage which has formed a species flock with substantial diversity in sympatry.</p>
      <p>Several lamprologine species show various degrees of population genetic structure and/or geographic variation in morphology (e.g. <xref rid="bib24 bib43 bib66 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Duftner et al., 2006; Koblmüller et al., 2007c; Risch and Snoeks, 2008; Nevado et al., 2009</xref>) or form geographic sister species (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duftner et al., 2007</xref>), pointing to the influence of ecological specialization on the dispersal ability promoting allopatric speciation. Apparent correlation between habitat specialization and dispersal ability and degree of genetic structure and species richness has been inferred not only for lamprologines but other Lake Tanganyika cichlids as well (<xref rid="bib109 bib93 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2001; Stiver et al., 2004; Duftner et al., 2006, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007c</xref>; <xref rid="bib46 bib84 bib58 bib107 bib113" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2009; Sefc et al., 2007; Nevado et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2009; Wagner and McCune, 2009</xref>). Another peculiarity of the lamprologine cichlids is the high frequency of interspecific gene flow for a variety of reasons discussed below. Hybridization is also likely to be involved in speciation in particular lamprologine lineages (<xref rid="bib67 bib76 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a; Schelly et al., 2006; Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>), contributing to the species richness of this tribe. Remarkably, on the other hand, it seems that the hybridization events in the history of several species did not wipe out the involved species.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic implications</title>
        <p>Our re-analysis is fully compatible with previous works (<xref rid="bib96 bib76 bib12 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Schelly et al., 2006; Day et al., 2007; Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>), but adds several new groupings. Considering that the inconsistent placement of <italic>N. buescheri</italic> in the mitochondrial MP tree was most likely caused by long-branch-attraction (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hendy and Penny, 1989</xref>), the 79 species analyzed were grouped into 12 clades (named clades I–XII in this study) which can be further grouped into 6 major mtDNA lineages, as clades VI–XII are likely to be monophyletic. Just as in previous analyses, the Congo River lamprologines were not recovered as sister clade to the lake endemics. Strikingly, <italic>N. devosi</italic> from the Malagarazi River was most closely related to a lake endemic (<italic>T. temporalis</italic>), although it was grouped in the same subclade of clade XII as its Congo River allies, together with <italic>N. petricola</italic> and <italic>N.</italic> sp. “eseki”. Thus, the inclusion of the Malagarazi-lamprologine corroborates our hypothesis that the most ancestral lineages of the tribe Lamprologini lived in the lake proper (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994</xref>) and that all riverine species diverged from their lake allies about 1.7 and 1.2 MYA. The possibility that the most ancient branch of the Lamprologini lived in the Proto-Malagarazi-Congo River and seeded the lacustrine radiation can be ruled out. Instead, lamprologines apparently colonized the Congo system via the Lukuga River, Lake Tanganyika’s only outflow, in the time window of 1.1–3.5 MYA during which this connection between Lake Tanganyika and the Congo system was open (<xref rid="bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>). In our new phylogeny, para- or polyphyly of the genera <italic>Lamprologus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>, <italic>Julidochromis</italic>, <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> and <italic>Telmatochromis</italic> is evident, but most likely for different reasons which are discussed below. We should note that we consider the genus <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic> as revised according to <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al. (2006)</xref>.</p>
        <p>Concerning the mtDNA – based groupings, clade I comprises two subclades, the first including <italic>N. mustax</italic>, <italic>N. nigriventris</italic>, <italic>N. cylindricus</italic> and <italic>Neolamprologus bifasciatus</italic>. Its second subclade – except for <italic>N. niger</italic> – exclusively comprises species with complex social system in which elder offspring contributes to brood care and territorial defense (<xref rid="bib1x" ref-type="bibr">Kuwamura, 1997</xref>). These species are <italic>N. gracilis</italic>, <italic>N. savoryi</italic>, <italic>N. olivaceous</italic> and <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>. In the mtDNA phylogeny three of them (<italic>N. gracilis</italic>, <italic>N. savoryi</italic> and <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>) are para- or polyphyletic with respect to their clade assignment, in that additional individuals were grouped in a subclade of clade XII, as previously shown for <italic>N. marunguensis</italic> (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b</xref>). Recent reciprocal gene flow, at least in one ancestral species, is further substantiated by this new evidence. The nuclear multilocus tree based on AFLP suggests monophyly of these taxa in the hypothetical species tree, with additional information from the mtDNA tree suggesting a past hybridization or introgression event twisting the tree, or less likely ancient incomplete lineage sorting. Clade II was already defined by <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al. (1994)</xref> as a highly diverse species group adapted to a variety of truly lacustrine ecological niches and named the “ossified group” on morphological grounds by <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Stiassny (1997)</xref>. This clade also contains the predatory genus <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>, which was recently revised by <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al. (2006)</xref>. The ossified group – lamprologines comprise perhaps the greatest ecological and behavioral diversity in that they contain both the largest predatory <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic> and the smallest cichlid species breeding in gastropod shells. Here we note great taxonomic incongruence within certain gastropod shell breeders, namely the sister species pair <italic>N. multifasciatus</italic> and <italic>N. similis</italic>, and the <italic>L. ocellatus</italic> species-assemblage (<italic>L. ocellatus</italic>, <italic>L. meleagris</italic> and <italic>L. speciosus</italic>), which on morphological and behavioral grounds must be grouped together. This issue is treated in detail in a separate paper, so that we briefly refer to our hypothesis of repeated hybridization events which was discussed elsewhere (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>). Clade III represents a new lineage formed by two eco-morphologically similar species, <italic>N. sexfasciatus</italic> and <italic>N. tretocephalus</italic>. These genetically close sister taxa are the only descendents of an ancient lineage. Likewise, clade IV comprises <italic>N. toae</italic> only as monotypic representative of another ancient lineage. The same applies to clade V which comprises <italic>V. moorii</italic>. This taxon was suggested as the most ancestral split in the pioneering molecular work of <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al. (1994)</xref>, but now allies with 5 other ancient lineages. Clade VI was also identified earlier to comprise <italic>N. longior</italic>, and is now extended to also contain <italic>N. leleupi</italic>, <italic>N. prochilus</italic> and <italic>N. obscurus</italic>. Clade VII again is monotypic comprising <italic>N. buescheri</italic> only. As discussed above, this species jumps inside clade I in MP, most likely due to long-branch attraction (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hendy and Penny, 1989</xref>). Clade VIII comprises <italic>N. cunningtoni</italic> (formerly <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>; see <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006</xref>), sister to <italic>N. modestus</italic> and <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic>. Clade IX comprises <italic>N. christyi</italic> only. We note that a highly similar species, tentatively named <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> sp. “eseki” is grouped in clade XII. Clade X is also monotypic with <italic>N. furcifer</italic> only. Clade XI comprises three species of the genus <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> plus <italic>J. ornatus</italic>, <italic>J. transcriptus</italic> and <italic>J. dickfeldi</italic>, but excluding <italic>J. marlieri</italic> and <italic>J. regani</italic> which are grouped in clade XII. Finally, clade XII comprises a highly complex and eco-morphologically as well as behaviorally heterogeneous array of taxa. The first subclade (clade XII.1) comprises <italic>N. falcicula</italic> only, the second is comprised by <italic>N. petricola</italic>, the two Congo River lamprologines <italic>L. congoensis</italic> and <italic>L. teugelsi</italic>, sister to (<italic>T. vittatus</italic> (<italic>N.</italic> sp. “eseki” (<italic>N. devosi</italic> (<italic>T. temporalis</italic>)))). It should be noted that one additional haplotype of <italic>T. temporalis</italic> is placed in paraphyly.</p>
        <p>Concerning the AFLP tree, it turned out that it was surprisingly compatible with the mtDNA phylogeny, corroborating 7 of the 12 clades with good bootstrap support. The remaining 5 clades were subdivided. As in the mtDNA phylogeny, most branches between the clades were short, corroborating that their diversification was rapid and established early in the lamprologine radiation. However, the AFLP data were able to shed light on several problematic placements in the mtDNA phylogeny: Contrasting with the mtDNA tree, all species which were placed para- or polyphyletically by mtDNA resulted as monophyletic in the AFLP tree. The genus <italic>Telmatochromis</italic>, which was scattered almost all over the mtDNA tree, turned out as monophyletic in the AFLP analysis, likewise the <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> species with brood-care helper behavior within clade XII.3. Interestingly, the paraphyletic placement of the genus <italic>Julidochromis</italic> was retained, corroborating the close relationship of <italic>J. ornatus</italic>, <italic>J. transcriptus</italic> and <italic>J. dickfeldi</italic> with the genus <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> and a somewhat more distant relationship to <italic>J. marlieri</italic> and <italic>J. regani</italic>. This paraphyly is most likely not due to ancient incomplete lineage sorting, given the large number of partially well supported nodes between the two <italic>Julidochromis</italic> clades (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">McCracken and Sorensen, 2005</xref>), but rather indicates convergent evolution of the particular <italic>Julidochromis</italic> phenotype with its characteristic body coloration. Also, the form of the genital papilla that clearly differs between the representatives of the two clades rejects a rather close relationship. The genital papilla of <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> on the other hand is very similar to that of <italic>J. dickfeldi</italic>, <italic>J. ornatus</italic> and <italic>J. transcriptus</italic>, further supporting the inferred phylogenetic relationships. Another aspect might be an ancient hybridization event among ancestral species of these two lineages, which might explain their partial morphological similarity despite long separate evolution afterward (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Para- or polyphyletic taxa</title>
        <p>While in some genera para- or polyphyly seems to be most likely the result of ancient ancestral polymorphism, it may be due to introgressive hybridization in others. A third alternative may be inadequate taxonomic assignment due to lack of diagnostic synapomorphic characters, causing genera defined by plesiomorphic traits. Previous studies (<xref rid="bib96 bib92 bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 1994; Stiassny, 1997; Schelly et al., 2006</xref>) diagnosed such taxonomic problems for the genera <italic>Lamprologus</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> and <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>. Our study confirms these problems and adds the genera <italic>Julidochromis</italic> and <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> to the list. Two cases of strong incompatibility of the mtDNA phylogeny with taxonomic assignments were found in the brood-care helper species <italic>N. marunguensis</italic> with its behavioral and morphological allies and the predatory species <italic>L. nkambae</italic> with its sister species <italic>L. elongatus</italic> and <italic>L. kendalli</italic>. As these taxa were resolved with their allies in the nuclear DNA tree, ancient incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization was taken into account, and both studies opted in favor of introgressive hybridization as the more likely reason (<xref rid="bib68 bib76" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b; Schelly et al., 2006</xref>). In many cases, however, it is impossible to rule out one of the two options, as both scenarios are realistic and might even be involved during the diversification of a lineage.</p>
        <p>We found more problematic placements in the mtDNA phylogenies suggesting para- or polyphyly of species, similar to that observed in <italic>N. marunguensis</italic> (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b</xref>): These concerned <italic>N. savoryi</italic>, <italic>N. gracilis</italic>, <italic>T. temporalis</italic> and <italic>T. dhonti</italic>, as well as a case of complete mtDNA exchange in all <italic>L. callipterus</italic> of the northern basin of Lake Tanganyika after introgression of <italic>N. fasciatus</italic> mtDNA (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Nevado et al., 2009</xref>). While it seems possible to argue in favor of ancient incomplete lineage sorting of an ancestral polymorphism in the cases of generic para- or polyphyly (as seen in <italic>Telmatochromis</italic> and <italic>Julidochromis</italic>), introgression and subsequent mtDNA capture seems a more likely explanation for the paraphyly within species (as seen in <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>, <italic>N. savoryi</italic>, and <italic>N. gracilis</italic>; see also <xref rid="bib68 bib76" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002b; Schelly et al., 2006</xref> and <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Nevado et al., 2009</xref> for more detailed arguments). The additional cases presented here of reticulation among taxa with brood-care helper behavior spread over clades I and XII highlight once more that introgressive hybridization is more frequent in the lamprologines than in any other tribe studied.</p>
        <p>Considering the high frequency of trans-specific gene flow one must ask for possible reasons. Unlike all other Tanganyikan lineages except for <italic>B. microlepis</italic> they are substrate breeders forming stable pairs or harems. Unlike riverine substrate breeders of the Tilapiine or Pelvicachromine lineages, several species display complex social behavior. Moreover, several social species form arrays of allopatric sister species which most likely evolved in allopatry. These species seem to remain reproductively coherent for long time spans, so that lake-level fluctuations may connect previously disjunct species and cause introgression or hybridization as discussed in detail in <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al. (2002b)</xref>. The following reticulations are suggested from the closest sister group relationships within and among the two mtDNA clades: <italic>N. savoryi</italic> with <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>; <italic>N. savoryi</italic> and <italic>T. temporalis</italic>; <italic>N. savoryi</italic> and <italic>T. dhonti</italic>; <italic>N. savoryi</italic> and <italic>T. bifrenatus</italic>; <italic>N. gracilis</italic> and <italic>N. marunguensis</italic> and/or <italic>N. savoryi</italic>. These cases have in common that the close relatedness of the introgressed mtDNA genotypes to populations or sister species of the donor species argues against ancestral polymorphism. A second array of lamprologine species living in close connection to each other concerns gastropod shell dwellers. They often live and spawn in extremely close vicinity, e.g. in <italic>L. callipterus</italic> nests, so that they are at higher risk for accidental cross-species fertilizations. That such hybridization cases are extremely rare can be ruled out, as (F1-) hybrids were repeatedly observed in <italic>L. callipterus</italic> nests (Aibara, pers. comm., <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>) as were heterospecific breeding pairs in other lamprologine species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We thus suggest that substrate breeders with complex social behavior, as adaptation to a life in densly packed species communities, may be more susceptible to trans-specific gene flow than maternal mouthbrooders.</p>
        <p>Concerning the third alternative, para- or polyphyly of species due to inadequate taxon sampling or lack of synapomorphic characters, two reasons can be put forward. The first would involve taxonomic error to be corrected in a revision including molecular phylogenies and additional synapomorphic characters, whatever traits they might be. The second reason is a much more intriguing one, in that evolution will necessarily produce para- or even polyphyletic taxa, when new species evolve strikingly novel features within a homogeneous clade, as exemplified by the evolution of birds within a clade of dinosaurs. In analogy, the genera <italic>Lamprologus</italic> or <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> may as well be considered as a plesiomorphic <italic>bauplan</italic> from which multiple sub-lineages with novel traits branched off. Given the scenario of multifold subdivision of rocky shores by ecological barriers, local innovation and speciation should prevail in the Lamprologini, as e.g. in the Tropheini for which parallel evolution of genus-diagnostic dentition types was also suggested (<xref rid="bib98 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 2003; Koblmüller et al., 2010</xref>). Molecular phylogenies will be useful to trace the ancestral states of various clades, to identify the ancestral generic features.</p>
        <p>An interesting point for discussion is the validity of paraphyletic genera. Should it turn out that the morphological features defining the genus <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> were originally apomorphic traits to be repeatedly modified in various sub-lineages by further innovation, one could argue to retain this genus name for all now plesiomorphic species and revise all genera with novel traits in monophyletic genera defined by certain apomorphic features. In this way necessary taxonomic adjustments can be carried out, but a “novel genus inflation” avoided.</p>

        <title>Timing and pace of the lamprologine radiation</title>
        <p>Age estimates based on molecular phylogenetic trees are based on a series of assumptions and require that four general conditions be met: (i) an accurate and well supported tree that resolves the important nodes in the phylogeny; (ii) reliable calibration points that provide upper and lower bounds for the nodes of interest; (iii) molecular clock methods that account for substitution rate heterogeneity within and across lineages; and (iv) a broad taxon sampling that includes the entire diversity in lineages (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Soltis et al., 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, reliable calibration points for estimating divergence times in the East African cichlid species flocks are scarce, with no fossils available from these lacustrine species flocks. Thus, estimation of divergence times in East African cichlids has mainly relied on the assumption that the onset of these spectacular intralacustrine radiations coincided with the formation of a real lacustrine habitat in Lake Tanganyika and the refilling of Lakes Malawi and Victoria following their desiccation (<xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib14 bib36 bib52 bib89" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1993, 1997; Delvaux, 1995; Johnson et al., 1996; Lezzar et al., 1996; Stager and Johnson, 2008</xref>). Only recently, alternative age estimates for the East African cichlid species flocks have been proposed based on independent external calibration points (<xref rid="bib29 bib81" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al., 2007; Schwarzer et al., 2009</xref>) resulting in considerably older divergence time estimates. However, these recent developments are not free of pitfalls and in particular difficult to reconcile with the biologic characteristics of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid species flock, such that these calibration methods are quite problematic (for a detailed discussion see <xref rid="bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a, b</xref>). The chronograms based on these alternative calibrations are shown in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</xref>. We decided to use the following calibration points (for justification see <xref rid="bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2008a, b</xref>): The establishment of a real lacustrine habitat in Lake Tanganyika with clear- and deep-water conditions 5–6 MYA (<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Tiercelin and Mondeguer, 1991</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib67 bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002</xref>), the time window for the Congo River <italic>Lamprologus</italic> to leave the lake via the Lukuga (<xref rid="bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>), and the age of the Lake Malawi species flock (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Delvaux, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 2001</xref>). There are ongoing analyses of a sediment core of the Lake Malawi deep basin at a depth of 650 m, which will without doubt result in a more precise estimate for the onset of lacustrine conditions in Lake Malawi after a dryup or near-dryup (Andrew Cohen, personal communication).</p>
        <p>Contrasting the general diversification patterns observed in the mouthbrooding Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribes (<xref rid="bib67 bib98 bib6 bib39 bib40 bib42 bib47 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a; Sturmbauer et al., 2003; Brandstätter et al., 2005; Koblmüller et al., 2004, 2005, 2007b, 2010; Duftner et al., 2005</xref>), the Lamprologini diversified more gradually with no clear bursts of speciation evident (also see <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2008</xref>), albeit a concentration of cladogenetic events about 2.5–3 MYA coincided with a period of increased diversification rates in the mouthbrooding cichlid lineages. Many species seem to be rather old, whereas recent speciation (&lt;1 MYA) predominantly occurred among the brood-care helper cichlids, in the <italic>Julidochromis</italic> assemblage and (mainly) the shell-breeding members of the genus <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic>. The ecological and behavioral characteristics of these species point to a reduced dispersal capacity, implying high degrees of population structure, as has already been demonstrated for the <italic>N. brichardi</italic>/<italic>N. pulcher</italic> complex (<xref rid="bib93 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Stiver et al., 2004; Duftner et al., 2007</xref>) and an increased potential for allopatric speciation. Indeed, most members of these groups are allopatrically distributed and some occur only along very short stretches of shoreline, indicating that ecological specialization resulted in increased diversification rate in these groups.</p>

        <title>Taxonomic implications</title>
        <p>A revision of the species and genera of the Lamprologini is needed and we hope to contribute valuable information for future assignments. Clearly, this work needs to be based on the original descriptions of <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boulenger (1898)</xref> and <xref rid="bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Max Poll’s insightful revisions (1956, 1986)</xref>, as well as on more recent work of others (<xref rid="bib90 bib92 bib11 bib106 bib75 bib76" ref-type="bibr">Stiassny, 1991, 1997; Colombe and Allgayer, 1985; Takahashi, 2003; Schelly and Stiassny, 2004; Schelly et al., 2006</xref>). As discussed by <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Stiassny (1992)</xref>, meristic and morphometric measurements, osteology and dentition alone will not suffice to achieve the goal, as too many characters are homoplastic. Concerning the genus <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>, its description was based on the assumption that the Congo River species branched ancestrally to the rest, so that <italic>Lamprologus</italic> was retained in those species only, except for <italic>L. callipterus</italic>. A viable way might be to re-assign the genus name <italic>Lamprologus</italic> to most <italic>Neolamprologus</italic> species. As <italic>L. congoensis</italic> is the type species of the genus <italic>Lamprologus</italic>, this would be a viable scenario. The type species of the genus <italic>Neolamrologus</italic> is <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic>. Thus, when keeping the genus <italic>Neolamprologus</italic>, priority must be given to the clade also containing <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic> (clade VIII), also including the species <italic>N. modestus</italic> and <italic>N. cunningtoni</italic>, (plus <italic>N. christy</italic>, <italic>N. mondabu</italic> and <italic>N. petricola</italic> on the basis of nuclear DNA data). Naming all members of the ossified group a new genus name <italic>Stiassnia</italic> as recently suggested by <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Day et al. (2007)</xref>, will not solve the problem, but cause further confusion, as perfectly valid genera such as <italic>Lepidiolamprologus</italic> (<xref rid="bib76 bib77" ref-type="bibr">Schelly et al., 2006, 2007</xref>) and <italic>Altolamprologus</italic> (but excluding <italic>N. fasciatus</italic>; contrasting <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2007</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Koblmüller et al., 2007a</xref>, and <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Nevado et al., 2009</xref>) would be subsumed, neglecting the huge eco-morphological and behavioral diversity of the ossified group.</p>
        <p>Considering molecular traits and brood-care helping behavior as synapomorphic traits, the <italic>N. brichardi</italic> assemblage including <italic>N. pulcher</italic>, <italic>N. helianthus</italic>, <italic>N. marunguensis</italic>, <italic>N. olivaceous</italic> and <italic>N. sarvori</italic>, may be a good candidate group for a new genus, as would be the clade comprising <italic>N. tetracanthus</italic>, <italic>N. cunningtoni</italic>, <italic>N. christyi</italic>, <italic>N. petricola</italic>, <italic>N. modestus</italic> and <italic>N. mondabu</italic>. Concerning <italic>Julidochromis</italic>, a split in one group retaining the genus name (<italic>J. marlieri</italic> and <italic>J. regani</italic>), and a new genus comprising all <italic>Chalinochromis</italic> and <italic>J. ornatus</italic> and <italic>J. dickfeldi</italic> is suggested by molecular data and the shape of the male genital papilla. This could be achieved by revising the latter species as <italic>Chalinochromis</italic>.</p>

          <p>We ran three independent analyses in BEAST using combinations of different sets of calibration points (uniform priors): (i) 5–6 MY for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the cichlids assigned to the C-lineage (encompassing the majority of mouthbrooding Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribes; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clabaut et al., 2005</xref>), assuming that this “primary radiation” (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Salzburger et al., 2002a</xref>) coincided with the formation of a truly lacustrine habitat with deep-water conditions in Lake Tanganyika (<xref rid="bib111 bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Tiercelin and Mondeguer, 1991; Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>); (ii) a maximum age of 0.57–1 MY for the split between the utaka and mbuna cichlids, based on the age of the refilling of Lake Malawi (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Delvaux, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Sturmbauer et al., 2001</xref>); (iii) an age of 5–6 MYA for the MRCA of the tribe Lamprologini, assuming that the onset of their diversification also coincided with the formation of a truly lacustrine habitat with deep-water conditions in Lake Tanganyika; (iv) a minimum age of 1.1 MY for the split of the Congo-lamprologines, based on the time window for a Lukuga-connection between Lake Tanganyika and the Congo system (<xref rid="bib52 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lezzar et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1997</xref>). In a fourth run we assumed an age of 9–12 MY for the MRCA of the C-lineage, compatible with the fossil calibrated diversification scenario discussed by <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al. (2007)</xref>. In a fifth run we applied a normally distributed prior with a mean of 30 MYA (S.D., 3.0 MY) for the MRCA of the C-lineage, based on <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Genner et al.’s (2007)</xref> Gondwanan origin scenario for the family Cichlidae.</p>
          <p>In order to check whether the posterior probabilities were actually affected by the data, we also ran analyses in which BEAST only sampled from the prior distribution (only for analyses with at least two calibration points). Estimates based on priors only are given below the estimates using the data.</p>
          <p>Age estimates are indicated in MY. Numbers in parentheses represent the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval.</p>
