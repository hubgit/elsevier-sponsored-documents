          <title>Background &amp; Aims</title>
          <p><italic>Classical</italic> ferroportin disease is characterized by hyperferritinemia, normal transferrin saturation, and iron overload in macrophages. A <italic>non-classical</italic> form is characterized by additional hepatocellular iron deposits and a high transferrin saturation. Both forms demonstrate autosomal dominant transmission and are associated with ferroportin gene (<italic>SLC40A1</italic>) mutations. <italic>SLC40A1</italic> encodes a cellular iron exporter expressed in macrophages, enterocytes, and hepatocytes. The aim of the analysis is to determine the penetrance of <italic>SLC40A1</italic> mutations and to evaluate <italic>in silico</italic> tools to predict the functional impairment of ferroportin mutations as an alternative to <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the biochemical presentation, genetics, and pathology of ferroportin disease.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Of the 176 individuals reported with <italic>SLC40A1</italic> mutations, 80 were classified as <italic>classical</italic> phenotype with hyperferritinemia and normal transferrin saturation. The <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype with hyperferritinemia and elevated transferrin saturation was present in 53 patients. The remaining patients had normal serum ferritin or the data were reported incompletely. Despite an increased hepatic iron concentration in all biopsied patients, significant fibrosis or cirrhosis was present in only 11%. Hyperferritinemia was present in 86% of individuals with ferroportin mutations. Bio-informatic analysis of ferroportin mutations showed that the PolyPhen score has a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 67% for the discrimination between ferroportin mutations and polymorphisms.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>In contrast to HFE hemochromatosis, ferroportin disease has a high penetrance, is genetically heterogeneous and is rarely associated with fibrosis. <italic>Non-classical</italic> ferroportin disease is associated with a higher risk of fibrosis and a more severe overload of hepatic iron.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ferroportin disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous iron overload syndrome <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Its clinical presentation has been documented in individual case reports and small case series. The natural course has been reported in one small series <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Hyperferritinemia, a normal to low transferrin saturation and Kupffer cell iron storage, presenting as hepatic and spleen iron overload, are considered characteristic features of <italic>classical</italic> ferroportin disease <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Increased transferrin saturation and hepatocellular iron overload, in addition to hyperferritinemia and macrophage iron loading, is considered characteristic for the <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A genotype–phenotype correlation was suggested to explain the clinical heterogeneity of the disease where most mutations (e.g. A77D, D157G, V162del, N174I, Q182H, Q248H, and G323V) are associated with <italic>classical</italic> ferroportin disease <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[5–8]</xref>. Distinct mutations (e.g. N144H, Y64N, C326Y/S, S338R, Y501C) have been found in patients who presented with the <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype <xref rid="bib5 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[5,9–12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ferroportin is the only known mammalian iron exporter and is expressed in macrophages and the basolateral membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes <xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[13–15]</xref>. In <italic>classical</italic> ferroportin disease, macrophage iron overload results from cellular iron export deficiency, i.e. loss of ferroportin function <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The D157G mutation leads to hepcidin-independent, constitutive binding of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and thus triggers ferroportin down-regulation <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The concept that other loss of function mutations of ferroportin result in intracellular retention of the iron export pump has been challenged recently <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>, but alternative mechanisms leading to iron transport deficiency have not been fully elucidated.</p>
      <p>Ferroportin inactivation is mediated by the peptide hormone hepcidin <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. Distinct mutations render ferroportin resistant to inactivation by hepcidin and cause a gain of iron export function, which results in hyper-absorption of dietary iron.</p>
      <p>Hepcidin is secreted by hepatocytes into the circulation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, hepatocellular iron loading, and endoplasmic reticulum stress <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. Circulating hepcidin directly interacts with ferroportin and induces its internalization and degradation <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The free thiol group of cysteine 326 of ferroportin is essential for hepcidin binding and ferroportin gene mutations affecting residue 326 result in hepcidin resistance <xref rid="bib7 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[7,24]</xref>. Patients with ferroportin disease due to hepcidin resistance mutations, exhibit a <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype <xref rid="bib8 bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[8,25,26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Functional studies in cells overexpressing ferroportin variants have been used to differentiate between gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations and benign sequence variants. The functional relevance of ferroportin mutations can also be deduced from mutation segregation studies within families with ferroportin disease. Association studies of <italic>SLC40A1</italic> polymorphisms with serum iron indices in population studies indirectly provide evidence for their functional relevance <xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[27–29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Bio-informatic tools were used to complement the genetic and functional studies. SIFT <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and PolyPhen <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> provide an <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of the functional consequences of missense mutations. The use of these tools in differentiating between diseases-associated ferroportin mutations from benign sequence variants was assessed. The clinical presentation and penetrance of ferroportin gene mutations were assessed from a systematic review of the literature.</p>

        <title>Search strategy</title>
        <p>A systematic literature search was undertaken in Medline from 1996 to June 2009 according to the following search strategy: #1 (‘<italic>SLC40A1</italic>’ or ‘SLC11A3’ or ‘ferroportin’ or ‘IREG’ or ‘IREG1’ or ‘IREG-1’ or ‘ferroportin’ or ‘ferroportin1’ or ‘ferroportin-1’ or ‘FPN’ or ‘FPN1’ or ‘FPN-1’).mp. [mp = title, original title, abstract, name of substance word, subject heading word]; #2 (‘mutation’ or ‘variant’).mp. [mp = title, original title, abstract, name of substance word, subject heading word]; # 3: #1 and #2. This search retrieved 143 references and was supplemented by manual searching for references of the relevant articles identified. After exclusion of review articles and non-human studies, data from 49 studies were included. This search was complemented by an Embase search using the search strategy: #1 (?<italic>SLC40A1</italic>? or ?SLC11A3? or ?ferroportin? or ?IREG? or ?IREG1? or ?IREG-1? or ?ferroportin? or ?ferroportin1? or ?ferroportin-1? or ?FPN? or ?FPN1? or ?FPN-1?).mp.

        <title>Prediction of the functional effect of amino acid substitutions by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis</title>
        <p>Two algorithms were used to evaluate the impact of amino acid substitutions on the function of ferroportin: polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen) <xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[31–33]</xref> and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Genetic variants of SLC40A1, identified in patients with suspected iron overload, were collected from the systematic review of the literature. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms of SLC40A1 were collected from the literature and from ENSEMBL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/">http://www.ensembl.org/</ext-link>) and the NCBI databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). A SLC40A1 variant was considered a mutation in case its frequency in the control population was undetermined, or lower than 1:50, and the variant was not reported in a SNP database <xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[27–29,34,35]</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>PolyPhen</title>
        <p>PolyPhen (= <italic>Poly</italic>morphism <italic>Phen</italic>otyping) is an automatic tool for prediction of possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein. The predictive value of the PolyPhen score was demonstrated in <italic>diabetes mellitus</italic> <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and cancer genetics <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This prediction is based on empirical rules which are applied to the sequence, phylogenetic, and structural information characterizing the substitution <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. PolyPhen was employed, as available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://coot.embl.de/PolyPhen/">http://coot.embl.de/PolyPhen/</ext-link> (version August 12, 2008), using the NCBI protein accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-p:Q9NP59">Q9NP59</ext-link> (<italic>SLC40A1</italic>) for ferroportin. In all cases, the prediction basis was only the default position-specific independent counts (PSIC) score derived from multiple sequence alignment of observations. PolyPhen scores of &gt;2.0 indicated protein function as ‘probably damaging’ and scores of &lt;1.5 as ‘benign’. A PolyPhen score of 1.5–2.0 is classified as ‘possibly’ damaging.</p>
        <p>A phylogenetic sequence alignment of selected ferroportin protein sequences is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>SIFT</title>
        <p>SIFT (= Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) is a sequence-homology-based tool that presumes that important amino acids will be conserved in the protein family. Changes at well-conserved positions tend to be predicted as deleterious. SIFT is a multi-step procedure that uses multiple alignment information to predict tolerated and deleterious substitutions for every position of the query sequence <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The SIFT Blink algorithm was applied to compare amino acid sequences of different organisms chosen from precomputed NCBI BLAST searches. For query in SIFT Blink, GI: 49065554 (<italic>SLC40A1</italic>) was used to analyze the protein sequence by using the parameter ‘best BLAST hit to each organism’ and omitting sequences &gt;90% identical to query. Edited alignments were reanalyzed by the appropriate module of SIFT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT_aligned_seqs_submit.html">http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT_aligned_seqs_submit.html</ext-link>). Results were reported as ‘affects protein function’ or ‘tolerated’ according to this analysis.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the bio-informatic tools to distinguish between benign and disease sequence variants, the SLC40A1 polymorphisms were used as true negatives and genetic variants of SLC40A1 identified in patients with ferroportin disease as true positives. The PolyPhen and SIFT scores were then analyzed in a ROC curve for their sensitivity and specificity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>For statistical analysis the software package for social sciences (SPSS v15.0) was used. To test for correlation between parameters, Pearson correlation was carried out for normally distributed parameters and Spearman rank correlation for non-normally distributed parameters. Normality of distribution was tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov curve-fitting. Differences between groups were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis test for non-Gaussian distributed variables. Correlations and differences were considered significant if <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05. Sensitivity and specificity of SIFT and PolyPhen scores were calculated form the ROC curve analysis using mutations identified in patients with ferroportin disease as true positives and polymorphisms reported in the SNP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez</ext-link>) as true negatives.</p>

        <title>High biochemical penetrance and variable clinical presentation of SLC40A1 mutations</title>
        <p>One hundred and seventy-six individuals with ferroportin gene mutations were reported in the literature, and their demographic and biochemical data are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The diagnosis of ferroportin disease was most frequently made in the 3rd to 4th decade of life and 43% of patients were female.</p>
        <p>To describe the disease presentation and the penetrance of underlying mutations, serum iron parameters, liver biopsy findings, MRI, comorbidities, and phlebotomy status were assessed. These were reported incompletely for several patients (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Forty-five comorbidities were reported in 29 patients (viral hepatitis 3, steatosis 12, obesity 5, diabetes 8, impaired glucose tolerance 2, hyperlipidemia 2, increased alcohol consumption 2, and sarcoidosis 2). Mean age and mean serum ferritin were significantly higher in patients with comorbidities, than in patients without comorbidities, (52 ± 15 years vs. 39 ± 20 years <italic>p </italic>= 0.002 and 3133 ± 3270 μg/L vs. 1965 ± 2067 μg/L, <italic>p </italic>= 0.017). Fibrosis ⩾F1 (Metavir) was significantly more common in patients with comorbidities than in patients without comorbidities (12 of 44 vs. 10 of 18; Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>The biochemical penetrance of ferroportin disease was 86% (142 of 166 patients), defined as hyperferritinemia &gt;300 μg/L in males and &gt;200 μg/L in females. We found a significant correlation between serum ferritin and age (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.344, <italic>n</italic> = 158, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001). The phenotype of hyperferritinemic patients was classified as <italic>classical</italic> if transferrin saturation was normal and as <italic>non-classical</italic> if transferrin saturation was increased (males &gt;50%, females &gt;45%). <italic>Classical</italic> disease was present in 80 patients as opposed to 53 patients with <italic>non-classical</italic> disease, whose mean age at presentation was significantly higher (44 vs. 37 years, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Serum iron parameters for the remaining 43 patients were either incompletely reported or normal (16 patients). Differences between <italic>classical</italic> and <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype are evident in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> where mean hemoglobin, ferritin, and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) were significantly lower in the <italic>classical</italic> disease cohort.</p>

Liver fibrosis ⩾F2 or liver cirrhosis was present in 7 of 53 biopsied patients (13%), and correlated with age (mean 53.3 vs. 36.2 years, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001).

One patient with ferroportin disease was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma which was possibly linked with occult hepatitis B virus infection <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In search of factors that discriminate ferroportin disease severity, the correlation between patient demographics, serum iron parameters, and liver biopsy findings was determined. The stage of liver fibrosis correlated significantly with age (<italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>n</italic> = 53, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), but neither with HIC nor with serum ferritin.

In addition, 9 ferroportin gene polymorphisms were reported, 3 of which were associated with increased serum ferritin in various populations (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) <xref rid="bib29 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[29,34]</xref>. The allele frequencies of 29 disease-associated ferroportin mutations had been determined in matched populations and was found to be &lt;1:100. It remains unclear whether L233V and D270P, each of which have been identified in single patients with iron overload, are disease-causing mutations or represent benign sequence variants <xref rid="bib43 bib65" ref-type="bibr">[43,65]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To determine whether bio-informatic tools PolyPhen and SIFT <xref rid="bib30 bib32 bib69" ref-type="bibr">[30,32,69]</xref> can discriminate between disease-causing <italic>SLC40A1</italic> mutations and benign sequence variants, their ability to classify known ferroportin sequence variants accordingly was tested. The predicted functional impairment of individual sequence variants from the PolyPhen and SIFT tools were used as outcome variables for a receiver-operator curve analysis. The PolyPhen score had a high diagnostic accuracy with a calculated area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.798 (<italic>p </italic>= 0.014) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Using the descriptive output of PolyPhen (i.e. probably damaging, possibly damaging or benign) as predictors of the functional consequence of particular gene variants, the sensitivity of the PolyPhen score was 99% and the specificity 67% (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). SIFT analysis predicted that 23 of 32 disease associated missense mutations ‘affects’ protein function and 9 are ‘tolerated’. Of 9 reported polymorphisms 7 were classified as ‘tolerated’ (AUROC 0.605 <italic>p </italic>= 0.37). The bio-informatics PolyPhen tool has a higher sensitivity and specificity than the SIFT score for the discrimination between missense mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms of <italic>SLC40A1</italic>.</p>
        <p>Serum ferritin concentration (<italic>r</italic> = 0.226, <italic>n</italic> = 136, <italic>p </italic>= 0.008), and transferrin saturation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.198, <italic>n</italic> = 128, <italic>p </italic>= 0.025) were correlated with the PolyPhen score, suggesting that ferroportin disease is more severe when phylogenetically more conserved residues are affected by the mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Ferroportin disease is the commonest genetic iron overload syndrome after HFE associated hemochromatosis and has a variable clinical presentation. This review of the literature and meta-analysis shows that hyperferritinemia and increased hepatic iron concentration are characteristic signs of the disease. In contrast, elevated transferrin saturation and splenic iron overload are variably present. Hyperferritinemia was found in 86% of individual with ferroportin mutations, but incomplete reporting is a limitation for the accurate assessment of disease penetrance. The observed correlation between age and serum ferritin supports the concept that ferroportin disease is a progressive iron overload disorder. It is therefore possible that patients detected through cross-sectional study designs have not yet had time to develop the ‘full-blown’ disease. Hence, it is difficult to assess the true penetrance without further follow-up data. By comparison, in genetic hemochromatosis hyperferritinemia was present in 55–86% of <italic>C282Y</italic> homozygotes <xref rid="bib70 bib71" ref-type="bibr">[70,71]</xref> and cirrhosis was present in 36% of more severely affected <italic>C282Y</italic> homozygous individuals with ferritin &gt;1000 μg/L <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To assess the pathology of ferroportin disease, the findings of liver biopsies were reviewed. However, liver biopsies were performed in only a few patients and the results were inconsistently reported. This prohibits a systematic classification of ferroportin disease based on liver biopsy results. In patients who underwent liver biopsies for ferroportin disease, hepatic iron concentration was invariably increased and the penetrance of liver fibrosis ⩾F2 was 13%. Age, hepatic iron concentration, and comorbidities were associated with fibrosis stage and are thus potential risk factors for fibrosis in ferroportin disease.</p>
      <p>A simple biochemical classification strategy based on transferrin saturation was used as an alternative to liver biopsy. Transferrin saturation is low to normal in <italic>classical</italic> ferroportin disease and increased in patients with the <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype. An arbitrary threshold for transferrin saturation of 45% for females and 50% for males was used to distinguish <italic>classical</italic> from the <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype. The value of this simple classification is supported by our meta-analysis, which shows that patients with the <italic>classical</italic> phenotype have lower hemoglobin concentrations. This may explain why patients with <italic>classical</italic> ferroportin disease appear to tolerate therapeutic venesection less well than hemochromatosis patients. MRI was proposed as an alternative to liver biopsy to discriminate between <italic>classical</italic> and <italic>non-classical</italic> ferroportin disease. However, no correlation between parameters of disease severity and MRI findings has been reported <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The genotype to phenotype correlation suggests that ferroportin disease has a multifactorial cause because not all mutations were unambiguously correlated with the <italic>classical</italic> or <italic>non-classical</italic> phenotype in all reported patients with a particular mutation. Our meta-analysis suggests that Y64N, V72F, and Y501C confer hepcidin resistance because the phenotypic presentation as <italic>non-classical</italic> disease is similar to the C326Y mutation <xref rid="bib7 bib74 bib75" ref-type="bibr">[7,74,75]</xref>. Similarly, <italic>classical</italic> mutations D157N, D181V, G80V, Q182H, R489K, and V162del may impair the iron export function of ferroportin through incorrect folding, subcellular mislocalization, or direct inhibition of the iron transport function <xref rid="bib6 bib18 bib75" ref-type="bibr">[6,18,75]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have assessed PolyPhen and SIFT <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> as alternatives to predict the effect of ferroportin mutations on protein function, because functional studies of ferroportin mutants <xref rid="bib6 bib17 bib18 bib68 bib75" ref-type="bibr">[6,17,18,68,75]</xref> have shown conflicting results <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. Our analysis shows that PolyPhen is a sensitive tool to identify disease-causing gene variants by classifying mutations identified in patients with iron overload as ‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ damaging. The sensitivity of the PolyPhen score is 99% and the specificity 67%. These findings suggest that the functional effect of ferroportin mutations can be predicted <italic>in silico</italic> and that these tools may help to interpret the relevance of newly-identified mutations in the future.</p>
      <p>The systematic review of the molecular genetics and the clinical presentation of ferroportin disease highlights the heterogeneity of the disease and the difficulties in securing the diagnosis. Similar to <italic>HFE</italic> hemochromatatosis, age, and comorbidities appear to be important risk factors for the development of fibrosis in patients with ferroportin disease <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. PolyPhen helps to score newly-identified, presumed <italic>SLC40A1</italic> mutations; identification of a genetic variant in <italic>SLC40A1</italic> is not sufficient to confirm ferroportin disease in patients with hyperferritinemia.</p>
