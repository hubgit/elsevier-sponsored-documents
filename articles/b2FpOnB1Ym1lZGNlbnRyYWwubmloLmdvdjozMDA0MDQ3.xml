      <abstract>
        <p>Acute activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or jumps in cardiac work increased cardiac endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL), yet it is unclear whether chronic AMPK activation maintains this elevated LPL. To activate AMPK chronically, metformin at low (300 mg/kg/d) and high dose (600 mg/kg/d) was administered in drinking water for 14 days. Control, metformin-treated, and 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR)–treated (0.5 mmol/L) ex vivo hearts were perfused to investigate uptake of triacylglycerol and cardiac LPL activity. For perfused rat hearts, increased uptake of labeled Intralipid and <italic>β</italic>-oxidation of Intralipid–fatty acid were noted for both AICAR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and high-dose metformin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Intralipid incorporation into tissue lipids was decreased by AICAR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and increased after high-dose metformin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), the increase manifest as enhanced triacylglycerol deposition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Low-dose metformin did not alter lipid uptake or tissue deposition. Both high-dose metformin and AICAR decreased cardiac acetyl–coenzyme A carboxylase activity (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Heparin-releasable LPL was increased after treatment with AICAR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and high-dose metformin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Low-dose metformin did not alter cardiac LPL. High-dose metformin doubled immunoreactive AMPK and phospho-AMPK protein (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and increased phosphorylation of p38–mitogen-activated protein kinase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). After heparin pretreatment, the rate of recruitment of LPL to the cardiac endothelium was increased by AICAR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) but not by high-dose metformin. These data suggest that AMPK activation increased cardiac endothelial LPL, yet acute and chronic activation of AMPK may yield increased LPL through differing mechanisms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by poor mechanical performance and a progressive alteration in cardiac substrate utilization, a transition from a reliance upon lipids to increased glucose use to preserve the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Coupled with these changes are a decrease in the phosphocreatine to ATP ratio <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref> and an increase in the activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This has a range of effects including a decrease in the activity of acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC) promoting lipid oxidation through removal of the allosteric inhibitor malonyl-CoA from CPT1-mediated uptake of fatty acids (FAs) into the mitochondria <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Increased glucose uptake is also noted after AMPK activation <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. Acute stimulation of AMPK is also associated with increased translocation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the cardiomyocyte where it is synthesized to the luminal surface of the cardiac endothelium <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. This increases the assimilation of triacylglycerol (TAG)-derived lipids into the cardiomyocyte for energy production. Indeed, activation of AMPK is beneficial to myocardium under metabolic stress; deletion of AMPK decreased tolerance to ischemic injury <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and led to poor glucose uptake. By contrast, AMPK activation attenuated hypertrophy for both cultured cardiomyocytes <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and rats with aortic constriction <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Yet the teleological rationale for increasing LPL translocation during cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia is unclear. The transition to glucose metabolism and the increasing reliance on glycolysis for ATP synthesis are indicative of decreased availability of oxygen; therefore, the increase in uptake of lipids through LPL appears contradictory.</p>
      <p>It is currently unclear whether chronic activation of AMPK will facilitate increased endothelial presentation of LPL in the myocardium in a similar manner to the examples of acute activation previously noted. Generation of mice with constitutively active forms of AMPK<italic>α</italic>2 led to poor mechanical performance and significant cardiac hypertrophy, coupled with increased storage of glycogen <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, investigation of the hypertrophied heart revealed a down-regulation of ATP-generating processes from all substrates. Therefore, to examine the effects of chronic AMPK activation in the absence of overt cardiac hypertrophy and without gross changes to substrate uptake and utilization, a less aggressive mechanism for activation of AMPK is required <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Metformin is a biguanide with insulin-sensitizing properties widely used to help normalize plasma glucose concentrations in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Metformin when added to cardiac perfusion medium has specific effects on myocardium, including protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>; and this is coupled with increased cardiac AMPK activity <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and also led to increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Metformin increased cardiac AMP levels in Krebs-perfused rat hearts <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, metformin when added to perfusate increased cardiac output in hearts and increased both FA <italic>β</italic>-oxidation and glycogen synthesis <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. By contrast, estimation of AMPK enzyme activity revealed no change for AMPK<italic>α</italic>1 or AMPK<italic>α</italic>2; and metformin did not alter AMPK/p-AMPK protein ratio, but increased p38–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and protein kinase C activity <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that metformin may have a range of effects in the myocardium, some dependent on AMPK.</p>
      <p>The in vivo effects of metformin on myocardium are less defined; indeed, metformin was without effect on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat hearts <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In humans, metformin increased plasma clearance of chylomicron (CM) and CM remnants for overweight/nondiabetic and insulin-resistant subjects <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>; in addition, metformin increased preheparin plasma LPL mass <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, indicative of increased lipoprotein clearance.</p>
      <p>We hypothesize that metformin will increase phosphorylation of AMPK in vivo for myocardium and therefore increase endothelial LPL and increase uptake of TAG by perfused hearts. Using the isolated perfused heart, we will investigate the impact of metformin on LPL presentation and turnover at the endothelial surface and investigate the activation of both AMPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p>

For selected groups of animals, metformin was administered in drinking water to give 2 doses, low and high, for 2 weeks (low, 300 mg/kg; high, 600 mg/kg). Metformin solutions were made freshly daily. Throughout this period, animals had ad libitum access to both food and water. Control animals were purchased at the appropriate experimental body mass (250-300 g).</p>

          <title>Tissue isolation and heart perfusion</title>
          <p>Animals were prepared surgically from fed rats as outlined previously <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Briefly, anesthesia was induced with halothane (3% in oxygen); and after thoracotomy, hearts were excised with lungs and thymus in situ and immersed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit medium. Excess tissue was dissected away, the thymus was divided to reveal the aortic arch, and the aorta was trimmed at the level of the carotid artery branches and cannulated (16-gauge cannula). Hearts were perfused in retrograde fashion as outlined previously <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Flow through the heart was established, and extra tissue was dissected away. An incision was made in the right ventricle, and the left atrial appendage was removed. A small flexible nonelastic balloon was inserted into the left atrium through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. This fluid-filled balloon was attached to a fine plastic catheter and connected to a pressure transducer (MEMSCAP, Skoppum, Norway) and a graduated syringe (0-1000 <italic>μ</italic>L; Hamilton, Reno, NE). Hearts were maintained at 37°C and perfused at a constant pressure (100 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) with a Krebs-Henseleit crystalloid medium supplemented with glucose (10 mmol/L) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.3 mmol/L) gassed with oxygen/CO<sub>2</sub> (95:5). Developed pressure was measured after isovolumic contraction of the fluid-filled balloon and recorded to computer using a digital interface (AD Instruments, Chalgrove, Oxford, United Kingdom). For selected hearts, the AMPK agonist 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) (final concentration, 0.5 mmol/L) was added to the perfusate. Initial experiments utilized AICAR at concentrations up to 2 mmol/L without significantly greater affect of LPL, yet with significant decreases of cardiac function; therefore, a lower concentration was adopted for the remaining experiments.</p>

          <title>Ventricular performance</title>
          <p>The initial balloon volume was adjusted until the diastolic pressure recorded measured 0 mm Hg and the developed pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) was less than 10 mm Hg. Balloon volume was increased until diastolic pressure reached 20 mm Hg, and this was established as the “working pressure” of the myocardium. Coronary flow was estimated from timed collections of a known volume of perfusate and expressed as volume per unit mass of cardiac tissue. Coronary flow was measured as timed ejections of a known volume.</p>
          <p>Ventricular performance was calculated off-line after the experiment using computer analysis software (Chart Version 5.0, AD Instruments). Heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and hence developed pressure were measured. Rate of change of pressure (+dP/dt) was calculated from the maxima of first-order derivative of pressure trace. Rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated at each balloon volume as the product of heart rate (beats per minute) × developed pressure (millimeters of mercury).</p>

Briefly, aliquots of perfusate (1.0 mL) were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) (20 mL).

Cardiac TAG and cholesterol were measured using commercial kits. For selected extracts, lipids were separated into phospholipids, diacylglycerol, FA, TAG, and cholesterol ester as outlined previously <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Briefly, ethanol extracts of tissue (100 mg) were separated on thin-layer chromatography plates (silica gel 60, 250 <italic>μ</italic>m) and separated using the solvent system hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1.6). Lipids were visualized using rhodamine 6G and UV light. Lipids were mechanically recovered from the thin-layer chromatography plate and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.</p>

Briefly, cardiac tissue (∼50 mg) was digested in alkali (200 <italic>μ</italic>L, 30% wt/vol KOH, 70°C, 60 minutes). Glycogen was precipitated from the resulting digest after addition of 5 vol ice-cold absolute ethanol. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in water; and the precipitation was repeated. Glycogen pellets were air-dried and redissolved in acetate buffer (50 mmol/L, pH = 4.5). <sup>14</sup>C-labeled glucose incorporation was estimated after scintillation counting of an aliquot of the redissolved glycogen. The remainder of the glycogen was treated with amyloglucosidase (100 units per reaction; final volume, 0.5 mL) and digested overnight.

          <p>Lipoprotein lipase activity was measured as previously described <xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[26,27]</xref>. Briefly, separate groups of hearts from control and metformin-treated rats were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit medium containing glucose (10 mmol/L) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.3 mmol/L) as outlined above. Perfusion was maintained initially in nonrecirculating mode to wash out erythrocytes. Recirculating perfusion was established and maintained for 5 minutes, after which heparin (final concentration, 10U/mL) was added and recirculated for a further 2 minutes. Samples of perfusate were isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cardiac tissue was then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cardiac mass was noted. Aliquots of postheparin perfusate and acetone-dried heart powders (10 mg) were reacted with TAG emulsion (final concentration, 5.6 mmol/L) prelabeled with <sup>3</sup>H-[9,10]-triolein supplemented with human plasma (ratio of plasma to final reaction volume, 1:6) as a source of apolipoprotein C-II. Reactions were carried out in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH = 8.0) supplemented with FA-free bovine albumin (final concentration, 2.0% wt/vol). Incubations were carried out at 37°C, and activities were expressed per unit mass of cardiac tissue. Total cardiac LPL activity was estimated as the sum of tissue residual LPL and heparin-releasable LPL activity. For estimates of postheparin plasma LPL activity, high- (4 mol/L) and low-NaCl (0.2 mol/L)–containing buffers were used to discriminate between hepatic lipase and total plasma lipase activity, respectively, released after heparin treatment. Lipoprotein lipase was estimated as hepatic subtracted from total lipase activities.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate that at a high dose, metformin is able to increase the presentation of LPL at the cardiac endothelium and that this may result from a direct activation of AMPK in the myocardium <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, this effect may not arise from an increase in the rate of recruitment to the endothelium because, after heparin pretreatment to deplete endothelial LPL, the recruitment of LPL to the endothelium after 60-minute perfusion is unchanged by metformin when compared with control, but increased by acute AICAR treatment.</p>
      <p>High-dose metformin and AICAR increased the uptake of Intralipid-derived FA and did not increase phosphorylation of AMPK protein yet led to LPL translocation to endothelium <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Low-dose metformin treatment was without effect on the endothelial LPL, the phosphorylation of AMPK, or, more critically, the uptake of Intralipid into the myocardium. None of the treatments used altered LPL messenger RNA expression (data not shown) or total LPL activity, suggesting that both AICAR and high-dose metformin alter distribution of an existing pool of enzyme rather than promoting synthesis of fresh enzyme. The majority (∼90%) of lipid uptake was diverted directly to <italic>β</italic>-oxidation, in agreement with our previous results <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The concentrations of AICAR used in the initial experiments were sufficient to increase the translocation of LPL to the endothelium over the course of the 60-minute perfusion and increased lipid uptake into the myocardium without apparent effect on AMPK protein phosphorylation. This may reflect allosteric activating effects of AMP/ZMP without direct phosphorylation as previously noted <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. 5-Amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside also significantly decreased accumulation of Intralipid as tissue lipids that may represent alterations to the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase, the first committed step in synthesis of TAG and phospholipid, and negatively regulated acutely by AMPK <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We also illustrate the downstream activation of p38-MAPK after metformin treatment and AICAR. More importantly, we document decreased ACC activity after both AICAR and high-dose metformin treatment despite no overt phosphorylation of AMPK protein. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase can phosphorylate downstream targets and affect cellular processes including FA <italic>β</italic>-oxidation <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Similar studies after activation of AMPK (in vivo) for rats document no change to utilization of glucose <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, yet AICAR was also noted to increase translocation of glucose transporter–4 to the cardiac endothelium and facilitate increased glucose uptake for perfused hearts <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We note the preservation of glucose uptake by AICAR coupled with maintained unlabeled tissue glycogen, yet a change in the fate of glucose characterized by increased deposition as glycogen. This is at odds with previous experiments detailing preserved glycogen levels and increased rates of glycogen synthesis <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, high-dose metformin increased glucose uptake with little impact on glycogen deposition, implying increased demands for ATP. Given the preservation of glucose-FA “Randle” cycle in hearts, the LPL-mediated increase in FA uptake might be expected to decrease glucose utilization <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>; and the increased FA <italic>β</italic>-oxidation levels may simply represent increased FA supply through LPL <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, as no changes to CPT1 protein were noted (data not shown). The increased FA <italic>β</italic>-oxidation after high-dose metformin is similar to that previously observed for FA-perfused hearts <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Experiments adopting the same high-dose regimen for metformin document increased citrate synthase and <italic>β</italic>-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase for soleus muscle via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<italic>γ</italic> coactivator-1<italic>α</italic>, implying increased FA <italic>β</italic>-oxidation <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Decreased ACC activity through phosphorylation by AMPK <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> may diminish cellular concentrations of malonyl-CoA <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, enhancing FA translocation into the mitochondria and measured as increased rates of <italic>β</italic>-oxidation in these perfusions. Chronic exposure to high-dose metformin led to accumulation of cardiac TAG, indicative of increased lipid uptake reflecting prolonged increase in uptake of plasma lipids through LPL. Previous experiments document a reduction in cardiac TAG for FA-perfused hearts after exposure to metformin <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, a discrepancy with our experiment that may reflect the increase (in vivo) in cardiac LPL in the intact animal leading to lipid accumulation in excess of requirements for <italic>β</italic>-oxidation.</p>
      <p>Previous experiments suggest that direct activation of AMPK after acute increases in cardiac work <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and with the pharmacologic agonist AICAR increased the recruitment of LPL to the endothelial surface from the subendothelial layers <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our experiments confirm that, after perfusion of heparin-pretreated hearts, now devoid of active endothelial LPL, AICAR increased LPL translocation to the endothelial surface; and this increase is met by transfer of tissue residual LPL activity to the endothelial surface. Such increased recruitment is not noted for metformin-treated hearts. This may result from the continuous activation of AMPK, initially increasing recruitment of LPL from subendothelial compartments through increased translocation from cardiomyocytes; but after prolonged activation, the pool becomes depleted. Our data support acute changes to LPL relying on a pool of available enzyme in the cardiomyocyte. We speculate that, after prolonged activation (chronic metformin exposure), this becomes depleted and increases in LPL transfer must be met through direct use of freshly transcribed protein; yet this is not reflected in changes to tissue residual LPL for metformin-treated hearts.</p>
      <p>It is striking that high dose metformin increased postheparin plasma LPL in the rat, mirroring changes noted for the myocardium. Previous experiments document that myocardium contains only 5% of the whole-body endothelial LPL activity <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and recent observation demonstrates increased LPL activity for metformin-treated L6 skeletal muscle cells in culture <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We anticipated decreased plasma TAG <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> in the presence of increased postheparin plasma LPL; however, none was recorded. We cannot rule out changes to food intake and hence CMs as a consequence of metformin exposure; however, previous observations suggest that for mice and rats the anorectic effects of metformin are modest and transient <xref rid="bib46 bib47" ref-type="bibr">[46,47]</xref>. We also cannot discount that changes to lipogenic rates in the rat increased hepatically derived TAG. However, hepatocyte culture with metformin suggests metformin was without effect on lipogenesis rates <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>; and 7-day exposure to low-dose metformin led to decreased very low-density lipoprotein secretion by perfused livers <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The divergent effects of low- vs high-dose metformin in vivo are complex. Low-dose metformin preserved normal metabolic function, whereas high-dose metformin increased substrate metabolism without altering cardiac work, suggestive of metabolic inefficiency. Indeed, previous observations suggest that metformin at high dose may directly inhibit complex I of the electron transport chain, thus decreasing metabolic efficiency of the substrates used <xref rid="bib49 bib50" ref-type="bibr">[49,50]</xref>. Decreased metabolic efficiency after high-dose metformin may suggest a mechanism resulting in both the increased <italic>β</italic>-oxidation of FA and increased glucose oxidation without altered cardiac work (estimated as RPP). By contrast, others report improved myocardial energy status, measured as increased phosphocreatine concentrations, after acute exposure to lower doses of metformin for perfused hearts <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and improved mitochondrial performance after metformin treatment of chronic coronary artery-ligated mice <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This discrepancy reflects an improvement of coupling of oxidative phosphorylation at low concentration of metformin <xref rid="bib14 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[14,22]</xref>, followed by direct inhibition of complex I and mitochondrial inefficiency at higher doses <xref rid="bib49 bib50" ref-type="bibr">[49,50]</xref>. 5-Amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside is known to be a negative inotrope and chronotrope <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; and given the intimate connection between cardiac work and metabolism maintenance of cardiac performance, our estimates of metabolite oxidation may be underestimates to meet decreased work.</p>

      <title>Concluding remarks</title>
      <p>We confirm that acute activation of AMPK by AICAR led to increased LPL presentation at the endothelium. Moreover, long-term metformin treatment increased LPL presentation at the cardiac endothelium possibly through an AMPK-dependent mechanism; and yet this did not simply represent increased rates recruitment from the subendothelial compartment.</p>
