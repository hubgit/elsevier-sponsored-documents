        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Potassium channels encoded by <italic>hERG</italic> (human ether-à-go-go-related gene) underlie the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub>) and <italic>hERG</italic> mutations underpin clinically important repolarization disorders. Virtually all electrophysiological investigations of hERG mutations have studied exclusively the hERG1a isoform; however, recent evidence indicates that native <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> channels may be comprised of hERG1a together with the hERG1b variant, which has a shorter N-terminus. Here, for the first time, electrophysiological effects were studied of a gain-of-function hERG mutation (N588K; responsible for the ‘SQT1’ variant of the short QT syndrome) on current (<italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>) carried by co-expressed hERG1a/1b channels. There were no significant effects of N588K on <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> activation or deactivation, but N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> showed little inactivation up to highly positive voltages (⩽+80 mV), a more marked effect than seen for hERG1a expressed alone. <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> under action potential voltage-clamp, and the effects on this of the N588K mutation, also showed differences from those previously reported for hERG1a. The amplified attenuation of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> inactivation for the N588K mutation reported here indicates that the study of co-expressed hERG1a/1b channels should be considered when investigating clinically relevant hERG channel mutations, even if these reside outside of the N-terminus region.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years a novel cardiac repolarization disorder called the short QT syndrome (SQTS) has been identified that is characterized by marked abbreviation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, changes in T wave morphology, poor rate adaptation of the QT interval and an increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden death <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[1–4]</xref>. Gain-of-function mutations in three potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel genes have been identified in SQTS patients: the SQT1 variant of the syndrome is linked to mutations to <italic>KCNH2</italic>, whilst SQT2 and SQT3 variants are associated, respectively, with mutations to <italic>KCNQ1</italic> and <italic>KCNJ2</italic> <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>. With a strong correlation between the SQTS and increased arrhythmia susceptibility <xref rid="bib4 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[4,8]</xref>, this syndrome provides an important opportunity to understand the link between accelerated cardiac repolarization and arrhythmogenesis; indeed, the SQTS has been proposed to provide a paradigm for understanding the role of cardiac K<sup>+</sup> channels in ventricular fibrillation <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The first cardiac K<sup>+</sup> current implicated in the SQTS was the rapid delayed rectifier (<italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub>), the channel α subunit of which is encoded by <italic>KCNH2</italic> (alternative nomenclature <italic>hERG</italic>: <italic>human ether-à-go-go-related gene</italic>) <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> plays a critical role in ventricular action potential (AP) repolarization and, thereby, in determining the duration of the QT interval <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. SQT1 patients were found to possess an asparagine to lysine substitution (N588K) in the S5-Pore linker region of the hERG channel protein <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>, resulting in attenuation of a rapid C-type inactivation process that normally limits hERG current (<italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub>) amplitude at positive voltages <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>. In turn, this is envisaged to enable greater repolarizing current to flow through SQT1 mutant than wild-type (WT) channels during cardiac APs <xref rid="bib5 bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[5,11–13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although studies conducted to-date have provided insight into the possible basis of abbreviated repolarization in SQT1 <xref rid="bib5 bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[5,11–13]</xref>, there is some question as to their physiological relevance. This is because – in common with virtually all studies of recombinant hERG channels that have been conducted to-date – <italic>all</italic> information on the likely consequences for <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> kinetics of the N588K hERG mutation comes from studies of the hERG1a isoform <xref rid="bib5 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[5,11–14]</xref>. Recent evidence, however, suggests that native cardiac <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> may not be comprised of hERG1a alone, but rather of hERG1a heteromerically expressed with an alternative transcript, hERG1b, an isoform with a truncated N-terminus <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. The ERG1b splice variant was initially identified in both mouse and human hearts and is identical to the 1a isoform except for a truncated N-terminus <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. It was subsequently proposed not to be expressed at the protein level in human heart <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; however, the ERG1a and 1b isoforms have now been found to co-exist in several species and are co-localized in the T-tubules of ventricular myocytes <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. They co-assemble to form functional heteromeric channels with altered kinetics (particularly in respect of deactivation) that may more closely recapitulate native <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> compared to ERG1a alone <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. Very recent evidence of altered WT hERG channel gating for co-expressed hERG1a/1b <xref rid="bib16 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[16,20]</xref> raises questions as to whether or not consequences for native <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> of disease-causing hERG mutations, including those that affect <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> inactivation, can be considered to be adequately recapitulated by studying hERG1a alone. Consequently, the present study was conducted to determine the effects of the N588K hERG SQT1 mutation on co-expressed hERG1a/1b channels. This report shows for the first time that, despite the fact that the location of the S5-Pore linker in the hERG channel is distant from that of the N-terminus, the effects of the SQT1 N588K hERG mutation on <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> carried by hERG1a/1b channels are more marked than those reported previously for hERG1a alone.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p><italic>Maintenance of hERG expressing cell lines.</italic> WT hERG1b in pcDNA 3.1 was generously donated by Dr. Gail Robertson (University of Wisconsin). The construction of N588K hERG1a from WT hERG in pcDNA 3.0 vector has been described previously <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. N588K hERG1b was made by replacement of the N-terminus in N588K 1a with that of WT hERG1b. This was achieved by 2-primer PCR of hERG1b (in pcDNA3.1) with the creation of a SalI restriction site (located in the S2 domain of hERG). The resulting PCR product was cut at SalI and HindIII sites and sub-cloned into the hERG1a vector (in pcDNA3.0). Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were passaged using a non-enzymatic agent (Splitase, AutogenBioclear) and plated out onto small sterilised glass coverslips in 30 mm petri dishes containing Kaighn’s modification of Ham’s F12-K medium (Gibco), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 200 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> gentamicin (Gibco). Prior to transfection, cells were plated out onto small sterilised glass coverslips. After 24 h cells were co-transfected with hERG and green fluorescent protein (in pCMX; donated by Dr. Jeremy Tavare) at a ratio of 2:1 using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the experiments performed using hERG1a and 1b co-expression, the cells were co-transfected with WT or N588K hERG1a and 1b at a co-expression ratio of 1:1. Following transfection, after 5–6 h incubation in serum-containing medium, medium was replaced. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 day prior to electrophysiological study. Data from WT and N588K hERG1a expressed alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) derive from CHO cells stably expressing WT or N588K hERG1a <xref rid="bib12 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[12,21]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Electrophysiological recording.</italic> Data acquisition and recording methods used were identical to those described in previous studies of WT and N588K hERG1a from our laboratory <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[12,13,22]</xref>. Briefly, whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements were made at 37 °C with an external solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose and 5 HEPES (titrated to pH 7.45 with NaOH). The pipette dialysis solution contained (in mM): 130 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP and 10 HEPES (titrated to pH 7.2 with KOH). Pipette resistance ranged from 1.5–3.5 MΩ. Typically ∼80% series resistance could be compensated. The action potential (AP) waveforms used for ‘AP clamp’ experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) are identical to those described in <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Data analysis and presentation.</italic> The numerical equation for voltage-dependence of activation is described in <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The use of a conventional ‘availability’ voltage-protocol to quantify the voltage-dependence of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> inactivation (e.g. <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>) is contingent upon the ability to inactivate fully <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> with strong membrane depolarization. However, in this study N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> could not be substantially inactivated by depolarizations as positive as +80 mV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and so we adopted an approach to quantify inactivation similar to that used in a recent investigation of inactivation-attenuating hERG mutations <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For each of several test voltages (+20, +40, +60, +80 mV; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) a 2 s depolarization (to activate/inactivate <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub>) was followed by a brief (2 ms) hyperpolarization to −100 mV (to relieve inactivation) and then inactivation was re-established by a 2 s depolarization to the same potential as the first step. The magnitude of the current transient during the third step of the protocol indicated <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> at each voltage after pronounced recovery from inactivation, whilst the sustained current at the end of the first pulse was taken as representing current remaining after inactivation was complete at the relevant test voltage. The ratio of the two was used to assess the fraction of inactivated <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> at each test voltage.</p>
      <p>Data were analysed using Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments), Excel 2002 and Prism v3 (Graphpad Inc.) software. Throughout, data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was carried out using a Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and one or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate, with Bonferroni post-test using Prism v3 (Graphpad Inc.). <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were taken to be statistically significant.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A shows representative records of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> elicited by a depolarizing voltage command to +20 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV (protocol shown as inset; <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[12,13,23]</xref>), for each of singly-expressed WT (Ai) and N588K (Aii) hERG1b channels. For both channels, <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1b</sub> amplitude during the depolarizing voltage command was much greater than the subsequent <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1b</sub> ‘tail’ visible on repolarization to −40 mV; tail current deactivation was also extremely rapid (with mono-exponential time-constants &lt;30 ms for both WT and N588K hERG1b). The lack of a resurgent <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> tail and extremely rapid deactivation time-course for WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1b</sub> indicates that, concordant with previous evidence <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>, WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1b</sub> expressed alone does not recapitulate native <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub>; therefore all further experiments were conducted using co-expressed hERG1a/1b. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B shows <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> families for each of WT (Bi) and N588K (Bii) <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> elicited by commands to a range of test voltages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B lower traces; cf. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> increased progressively with depolarization up to ∼−10 mV and then declined at more positive potentials, whereas N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> increased progressively up to ∼+40/+50 mV, declining only slightly at +60 mV. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ci illustrates this graphically for mean end-pulse current data. Resurgent <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> tails for WT hERG were evident, whilst for N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> tails were markedly smaller than pulse currents following commands to positive voltages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bii). Normalized peak <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> tail – voltage relations were plotted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Cii) to ascertain parameters describing voltage-dependent activation for the two channels (cf. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). The calculated half-maximal activation voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) values for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> were, respectively, −27.0 ± 0.4 mV and −27.3 ± 1.1 mV, with corresponding <italic>k</italic> values of 7.4 ± 0.4 and 8.0 ± 1.0 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 8 cells each; <italic>P </italic>&gt; 0.05 for both). These values are significantly more negative (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001) than those we have previously reported for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> alone, under identical recording conditions (−20.1 ± 0.1 and −22.4 ± 0.6 mV, respectively, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and cf. <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Collectively, the data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> indicate that, at 37 °C, the N588K mutation alters rectification of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, but without significantly altering the voltage-dependence of activation (cf. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to compare <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG</sub> deactivation between WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> the protocol shown above <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A (inset) was used <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the decline of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> tails at different repolarization voltages was compared using bi-exponential tail current fitting. There was no significant difference between WT and mutant <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> in either fast (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>Bi) or slow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>Bii) time-constants of deactivation, nor in the relative contributions of the fast/slow deactivating components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>Biii; <italic>n</italic> = 7 cells each). The deactivation time-course for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> was, however, faster than that of the corresponding hERG1a channels (data not shown), consistent with accelerated deactivation reported previously for WT hERG1a/1b <xref rid="bib16 bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[16,18,20]</xref>. A plot of the fully-activated current–voltage (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic>) relation derived from this protocol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C; cf. <xref rid="bib12 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[12,24]</xref>) confirmed impaired rectification of N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> compared to WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, accompanied by a modest positive-shift in reversal potential (from −85.2 ± 0.4 mV to −78.7 ± 1.9 mV; <italic>n</italic> = 7 cells each) and relative pNa/pK ratio (from 0.0097 (WT) to 0.0201 (N588K)). These effects of the N588K hERG mutation are similar to those reported previously for hERG1a alone <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent evidence suggests inactivation gating of WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> is altered compared to that of WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Given this, and also that the major reported effect of the N588K mutation on <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> is on the voltage-dependence of inactivation <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>, it was imperative to determine effects of the N588K mutation on <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>. The three-step protocol shown as an inset of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and B (see ‘Methods’ and <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) was used to assess fractional inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, at each of the 4 positive membrane potentials examined, WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> was substantially inactivated. By contrast, however, N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> exhibited only a small transient component at any voltage, with a large sustained component (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), indicative of comparatively little fractional inactivation at any of the voltages examined. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C shows mean data for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, with mean data for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> also included for comparison. There was little difference between WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> in fractional current inactivation at any voltage, whilst by contrast there was a very substantial difference at each voltage between N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>. Therefore, our data show that the inactivation-attenuating effects of the N588K mutation were markedly greater when co-expressed hERG1a and 1b were studied than when hERG1a alone was studied.</p>
      <p>In order to assess the physiological consequences of the N588K mutation for co-expressed hERG1a and 1b, AP clamp experiments were performed. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A shows representative currents for WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>Ai) and N588K (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>Aii) <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, elicited by a human ventricular AP command <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> there was little current immediately following the AP upstroke, with current developing progressively throughout the AP plateau, declining during the terminal repolarization phase. Mean data from 14 cells showed that maximal WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> during AP repolarization occurred at −22.3 ± 1.0 mV. This value is significantly more positive than that we have recently reported for WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> during an identical AP command (−37.6 ± 1.7 mV; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) and the earlier peak <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> is consistent with faster deactivation together with accelerated activation and recovery from inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> recently reported <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, current increased rapidly following the AP upstroke and peaked early during the AP plateau. Current then declined, with a relatively rapid decline during the final AP repolarization phase. Peak N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> occurred at +27.1 ± 0.2 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 14), which compares with a value of +24.6 ± 0.6 mV for <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> during the same waveform <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001). Current density plots for peak repolarizing <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C) show a markedly greater maximal repolarizing current for N588K than for WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> during a ventricular AP command waveform (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>For hERG1a, a differential effect of the N588K mutation on current during ventricular and Purkinje fibre APs has been suggested to contribute toward U wave formation and a pro-arrhythmic substrate in SQT1 <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>. Therefore, AP clamp experiments with a Purkinje fibre (PF) AP command <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> were also performed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). For both WT (Bi) and N588K (Bii) <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, current during the PF AP was bow-shaped, peaking at −17.4 ± 3.0 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and −9.0 ± 0.3 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 14; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001), respectively, (this compares with −45.6 ± 1.6 and −14.8 ± 0.3 mV for WT and N588K <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a</sub> during the same PF waveform under identical conditions <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C shows that peak repolarization current densities for both WT and N588K conditions during the PF AP were significantly lower than those during the ventricular AP command, and that the N588K mutation produced only a small increase in maximal repolarizing <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> amplitude, that was not statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&gt; 0.05). Thus, effects of the N588K mutation on current during the PF AP were small for co-expressed hERG1a/1b (smaller than for hERG1a alone under identical conditions <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>), consistent with enhanced heterogeneity in repolarizing <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> between ventricular and PF APs in SQT1.</p>
      <p>To-date there is comparatively little information available on the effects of clinically relevant hERG mutations on hERG1a/1b heteromers <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This is the first study to have investigated hERG1a/1b heteromeric channels in the context of the short QT syndrome and it is only the second that provides detailed information on biophysical properties of WT <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub>, at a physiologically relevant temperature. Our findings support the notion that the contribution to ventricular repolarization of current through heteromeric WT hERG1a/1b channels differs from that of hERG1a alone <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. More remarkably, they demonstrate for the first time a marked difference in the inactivation-attenuating effect of a pathologically relevant hERG mutation when heteromeric hERG1a/1b channels are studied. N-terminal deletion has been demonstrated to slow hERG1a inactivation <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and the amplified effect of the N588K mutation on fractional inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>hERG1a/1b</sub> seen here may reflect synergy between the mutation’s disruption of the role of the S5-Pore linker in the inactivation process and the potential for reduced stabilization of inactivation due to the fact that 1a/1b heteromers have fewer N-terminal contacts to interact with the internal S4–S5 linker <xref rid="bib16 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[16,25]</xref>. Whilst it may be intuitively obvious that the study of hERG1b-specific mutations <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or N-terminal long QT syndrome (LQTS) mutations (∼20% of hERG1a-linked LQTS mutations occur in the N-terminus <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>) warrants the study of hERG1a/1b heteromeric channels, until now there may not have been a clear rationale to adopt this approach when studying mutations that are distant from the N-terminus. The present study provides a clear demonstration that such mutations cannot be assumed to have identical effects on hERG1a/1b to those found for hERG1a alone. Consequently, it may be prudent to incorporate more widely the study of hERG1a/1b heteromeric channels when investigating biophysical consequences of hERG mutations in both the LQTS and SQTS.</p>
