        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Numerous studies of amyloid assembly have indicated that partially folded protein species are responsible for initiating aggregation. Despite their importance, the structural and dynamic features of amyloidogenic intermediates and the molecular details of how they cause aggregation remain elusive. Here, we use ΔN6, a truncation variant of the naturally amyloidogenic protein β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m), to determine the solution structure of a nonnative amyloidogenic intermediate at high resolution. The structure of ΔN6 reveals a major repacking of the hydrophobic core to accommodate the nonnative peptidyl-prolyl <italic>trans</italic>-isomer at Pro32. These structural changes, together with a concomitant pH-dependent enhancement in backbone dynamics on a microsecond-millisecond timescale, give rise to a rare conformer with increased amyloidogenic potential. We further reveal that catalytic amounts of ΔN6 are competent to convert nonamyloidogenic human wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m (Hβ<sub>2</sub>m) into a rare amyloidogenic conformation and provide structural evidence for the mechanism by which this conformational conversion occurs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A number of human diseases involve protein misfolding events that ultimately result in the malfunctioning of the cellular machinery (<xref rid="bib54 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Welch, 2004; Gidalevitz et al., 2006</xref>). In one class of these disorders, normally soluble proteins self-associate to form fibrillar aggregates known as amyloid (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Westermark et al., 2007</xref>). Studies have suggested that equilibration between a natively folded protein and one or more partially or more highly unfolded species is a key initiating event in amyloid formation (<xref rid="bib4 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 1997; Calamai et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, the protein-only hypothesis describes the potential of infectious nonnative protein conformations (PrP<sup>SC</sup>) to transmit their biophysical properties onto native protein conformers (PrP<sup>C</sup>), leading to the propagation of protein misfolding and aggregation (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sindi and Serio, 2009</xref>). Studies on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and systemic and senile amyloidosis (<xref rid="bib29 bib33 bib46 bib56 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2000; Lundmark et al., 2002; Rocken and Shakespeare, 2002; Xing et al., 2002; Angot and Brundin, 2009</xref>) have suggested that prion-like behavior may be a general feature of misfolded proteins (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brundin et al., 2010</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of conformational conversion remains elusive.</p>
      <p>Crucial to the understanding of the early stages of amyloid assembly is the elucidation of the structural changes that occur when a normally soluble protein becomes aggregation prone. Structural investigation of early aggregation-prone species is hampered, however, by their transient nature, heterogeneity, and instability (<xref rid="bib8 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Calamai et al., 2005; Jahn and Radford, 2008</xref>). In general, the creation of unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, increased hydrophobic surface area, and/or loss of so-called negative design features (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Richardson and Richardson, 2002</xref>) has been implicated in increasing amyloid potential (<xref rid="bib32 bib35 bib1 bib41 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000; Monti et al., 2005; Ahn et al., 2006; Qin et al., 2007; Calabrese et al., 2008</xref>). However, the structural details of such changes and precisely how they engender amyloidogenicity remain unclear.</p>
      <p>Here, we utilized β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m), a 99-residue protein with an immunoglobulin fold (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Becker and Reeke, 1985</xref>), to investigate the initiating events of amyloid assembly in all-atom detail. β<sub>2</sub>m is the major component of fibrillar deposits in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gejyo et al., 1985</xref>). While the concentration of monomeric β<sub>2</sub>m is a risk factor for amyloid deposition in DRA, the native monomer is not able to assemble into amyloid fibrils spontaneously at neutral pH in the absence of additional factors (reviewed in <xref rid="bib6 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese and Miranker, 2009; Platt and Radford, 2009</xref>). Instead, an increase in concentration of the nonnative, amyloidogenic precursor I<sub>T</sub>, a monomeric β<sub>2</sub>m conformer that contains a nonnative peptidyl-prolyl <italic>trans</italic>-isomer of Pro32, has been shown to be a key trigger of amyloid formation (<xref rid="bib10 bib25 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chiti et al., 2001; Jahn et al., 2006; Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of a <italic>trans</italic>-prolyl peptide bond at residue 32 (rather than <italic>trans</italic>-Ala32, Val32, or Gly32 [<xref rid="bib15 bib25 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Eakin et al., 2006; Jahn et al., 2006; Sakata et al., 2008</xref>]) is required to form a species able to nucleate amyloid formation, presumably because of conformational restrictions imposed by the X-Pro32 <italic>trans</italic>-peptide bond itself (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>). The detailed structural changes occurring during interconversion between native β<sub>2</sub>m and the I<sub>T</sub> state, however, remain elusive, despite a number of studies using NMR (<xref rid="bib25 bib34 bib28 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jahn et al., 2006; Mimmi et al., 2006; Kameda et al., 2009; Corazza et al., 2010</xref>) and X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="bib15 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Eakin et al., 2006; Calabrese et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we used ΔN6, a truncation variant of human β<sub>2</sub>m found in amyloid deposits of patients with DRA that lacks the N-terminal six amino acids and closely mimics I<sub>T</sub> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>), to determine the solution structure of this nonnative, amyloidogenic intermediate at high resolution using NMR spectroscopy. The results reveal a remarkable repacking of the hydrophobic core that is reminiscent of, but distinct from, the nonamyloidogenic Cu<sup>2+</sup>-bound hexameric state previously captured by crystallography (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese et al., 2008</xref>). Most strikingly, we show that ΔN6 is able to interact specifically with human wild-type β<sub>2</sub>m (Hβ<sub>2</sub>m), causing it to adopt an amyloid-competent structure and thereby reveal the mechanism of conformational conversion of a naturally occurring amyloidogenic protein in atomistic detail.</p>

        <title>Real-Time NMR Studies Confirm the Structural Resemblance of ΔN6 and I<sub>T</sub></title>
        <p>To confirm the structural similarity of ΔN6 with the slow-folding intermediate, I<sub>T</sub>, that is known to be highly amyloidogenic (<xref rid="bib10 bib25 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chiti et al., 2001; Jahn et al., 2006; Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>), Hβ<sub>2</sub>m was denatured in 8 M urea and then refolded by 10-fold dilution into buffer at pH 7.5, 25°C. SOFAST <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schanda and Brutscher, 2005</xref>) were then acquired approximately 2 min after refolding commenced, at which time I<sub>T</sub> is populated to about 75% (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The spectrum reveals 76 cross-peaks corresponding to the I<sub>T</sub> state, 68 of which overlay with resonances of ΔN6 (<sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N within ± 0.04/0.2 ppm, respectively). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B shows one region of the SOFAST <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HMQC spectra obtained at different folding times. The data show that resonances arising from the kinetically formed I<sub>T</sub> superpose with those of ΔN6 at equilibrium. The peaks corresponding to I<sub>T</sub> then decrease in intensity with increased folding time, as resonances of the native state emerge. Resonances in the spectrum of ΔN6 were assigned using standard procedures (see below). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C shows the difference in chemical shift of the 76 cross-peaks identified for I<sub>T</sub> by comparison with the assigned spectrum of ΔN6. The data reveal differences in chemical shift of &lt;0.2 ppm (<sup>1</sup>H) or 0.8 ppm (<sup>15</sup>N), confirming the fidelity of ΔN6 as a structural mimic of I<sub>T</sub>.</p>

        <title>The Structure of ΔN6</title>
        <p>To allow detailed comparison of the structure and dynamics of ΔN6 and native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, chemical shift assignment of the spectra of both proteins was carried out (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N assignments were obtained for 88 out of 99 residues of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and 84 out of 93 residues of ΔN6. <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C side-chain assignments were obtained for 95% of residues in Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and 90% of residues for ΔN6. The results indicate, as anticipated, that the X-Pro32 peptide bond adopts a <italic>trans</italic>-conformation in ΔN6 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, comparison of the chemical shift differences between Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A–2F) revealed that of the 93 residues in ΔN6, approximately 60 residues (i.e., more than half of the molecule) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G) have chemical shifts that deviate substantially (Δ<sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C &gt; 0.2/0.8/0.4 ppm for all resonances analyzed) from the values for native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m. While many of these residues lie in spatial proximity to Pro32 in native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2002</xref>), some are distant to this site, consistent with Pro32 being the epicenter of widespread conformational changes in ΔN6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G).</p>
        <p>To determine the structures of native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6, 2065 or 2565 nuclear Overhauser enhancements (nOe) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>), 128 or 118 dihedral angles, and 75 or 76 residual dipolar couplings (RDC) were obtained for each protein, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Structural ensembles were then calculated using the PASD algorithm (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kuszewski et al., 2004</xref>) to obtain 50 preliminary structures that were transferred into ARIA 2.0 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rieping et al., 2007</xref>) for further refinement (see <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). In the final ensemble of 30 structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), the rmsd of backbone atoms (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>Cα, <sup>13</sup>C′) within ordered regions is 0.42 and 0.28 Å from the mean structures of native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6, respectively. The structural ensembles reveal that ΔN6 retains a native-like β sandwich fold containing two antiparallel β sheets tethered by a single disulfide bridge between Cys25 and Cys80 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Minor differences are observed in the lengths of β strands, including the short D strand that adopts variable structures in ΔN6 (see <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>). Despite being highly amyloidogenic, therefore, ΔN6 contains a well-defined structure under the conditions employed that, in terms of the main chain, is not significantly perturbed compared with native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (within ordered regions, the Cα rms between Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6 is approximately 1.3 Å) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In contrast with the minor differences in the main chain of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6, dramatic differences are observed for side chains, both close to Pro32 and distal to this site, that result from a substantial repacking of the molecule's core (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Of the 21 residues that comprise the hydrophobic core of native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, 17 undergo significant movement (&gt;2 Å) between the two structures (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>). Most strikingly, the aromatic side chain of Phe30 moves out of the hydrophobic core in ΔN6 toward the surface where the N terminus was originally placed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). This large movement (Hζ of Phe30 moves by ∼9.5 Å) is accompanied by further restructuring of side chains in the core (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). In particular, the X-Pro32 <italic>cis</italic>-peptide bond is relaxed toward the more favored <italic>trans</italic>-peptidyl-prolyl isomer (Hγ moves by ∼9.6 Å). As a consequence, the backbone (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C′) interactions between Phe30 and Phe62 are disrupted so that the side chain of the latter rotates by &gt;90° around Cγ and loses connection with the BC-loop (Cγ moves by ∼7.4 Å) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The change in rotameric state of Phe30 also disrupts the main-chain hydrogen bonding between Ser28 and Lys6/Met6 in the A and B strands, leading to a loss in β strand structure at these residues and causing the side chain of His84 to rotate around its Cγ by ∼45° (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The cavity left by Phe30 is mostly filled by the hydrophobic side chains of Pro32, Leu64, and Ile35, the latter two side chains changing their rotamer angles so as to accomplish this. The conformational changes that result from isomerization of the X-Pro32 peptide bond do not stop at Cys25-Cys80 disulfide, but propagate deep into the other half of the molecule, leading to movements of the side chains of Asn21, Phe70, Phe78, and Trp95 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). These side-chain movements result in differences in surface charge and hydrophobicity (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A), consistent with previous suggestions that the N terminus of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m is important in maintaining the native hydrophobic folding balance (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2000</xref>). The data thus show that docking of the N-terminal hexapeptide during the last steps in folding locks Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into a thermodynamically stable native structure that contains an unfavorable X-Pro32 <italic>cis</italic>-peptide bond. Consistent with this, resonances arising from the N-terminal seven residues were not identified in the HMQC spectrum of I<sub>T</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), suggesting that this region is displaced from its native conformation in the folding intermediate. Once the N-terminal hexapeptide is displaced, or removed as in ΔN6, the molecule relaxes toward an amyloidogenic conformation containing the X-Pro32 <italic>trans</italic>-isomer.</p>

        <title>The Dynamics of ΔN6 Reveal a Rarely Populated Nucleation- and Elongation-Competent Species</title>
        <p>ΔN6 has been shown to be highly aggregation prone compared with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, suggesting that this variant is uniquely able to sample one or more amyloidogenic conformers at physiological pH (<xref rid="bib17 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2000; Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, amyloid fibrils are obtained after incubation of ΔN6 at 37°C, pH 7.2 in a protein-concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). While ΔN6 converts quantitatively into insoluble aggregates, as indicated by a lack of residual monomer in the supernatant after fibrillation is complete, as judged by SDS-PAGE (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) (data not shown), native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m does not show an increase in ThT fluorescence and remains soluble (judged by SDS-PAGE, data not shown) even after 50 days incubation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Further experiments revealed that the amyloidogenicity of ΔN6 is highly pH dependent: no fibrils result when the protein (80 μM) is incubated at pH 8.2 for 50 days, while the protein converts into amyloid fibrils at pH 6.2 more rapidly (t<sub>lag</sub> = 15 ± 4 days) than at pH 7.2 (t<sub>lag</sub> = 35 ± 4 days) at this protein concentration (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). Replacing His84 (a residue in close proximity to Pro32) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) with alanine in ΔN6 substantially reduces the ability of this protein to assemble de novo into amyloid fibrils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). The rate of elongation of fibrillar seeds of ΔN6 by ΔN6 monomers is also enhanced at pH 6.2 compared with pH 8.2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). The data indicate, therefore, that protonation of His84 and possibly other side chains with pK<sub>a</sub> ∼7 amplifies the amyloidogenicity of ΔN6, presumably by causing conformational changes that increase the population of species with enhanced amyloid potential within the ensemble of structures available.</p>
        <p>To explore in more detail the enhanced ability of ΔN6 to nucleate amyloid formation compared with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, the dynamic properties of the two proteins were compared. Whereas <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>1</sub> and {<sup>1</sup>H}<sup>15</sup>N nOe relaxation measurements show limited motions on a picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale for both proteins (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B), significantly higher <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates were observed for residues 25–34 (BC-loop) in ΔN6 compared with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). Additionally, several residues in the DE-loop (54–57, 59, 61–63) of ΔN6 relax too rapidly (R<sub>2</sub> ≥ 25 s<sup>−1</sup>, indicated by gray bars in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F–4H) to determine their R<sub>2</sub> rates reliably but were readily quantified for Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, suggestive of enhanced chemical exchange processes on a microsecond-to-millisecond timescale for these residues in the former protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). The local dynamics of residues 25–34 (BC-loop) and 51–66 (DE-loop) of ΔN6 are dependent on pH, with complete suppression of their enhanced dynamics at pH 8.2 and significant enhancement relative to other residues at pH 6.2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G), consistent with the pH dependency of fibril formation. Finally, the pH-dependent increase in R<sub>2</sub> dynamics of residues 25–34 in ΔN6/H84A is substantially reduced at pH 6.2 compared with ΔN6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G and 4H), consistent with the view that protonation of His84 plays a role in enhancing the dynamics of the BC-loop (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>I) and the amyloidogenicity of ΔN6. Analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of ΔN6 at increased protein concentration revealed a set of resonances (in the BC- and DE-loops) that shifted significantly dependent on the protein concentration, suggesting that fibril formation of ΔN6 occurs by transient oligomerization via a newly formed dimerization interface involving these residues (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). Importantly, a clear correlation is observed between chemical shift alterations of ΔN6 with pH and protein concentration (data not shown). These data suggest that protonation events and protein conformational changes are coupled processes that together initiate the aggregation cascade.</p>

        <title>ΔN6 Converts Native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into an Amyloid-Competent State</title>
        <p>Given the inherent potential of ΔN6 to nucleate fibril formation in vitro, we speculated that bimolecular collision between ΔN6 and Hβ<sub>2</sub>m might enhance the amyloid potential of the latter protein by its conversion to an amyloidogenic state, akin to conformational conversion in prions. To test this hypothesis, Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6 were incubated separately or as mixtures at a final total concentration of 80 μM in ratios of 1:1, 1:9, or 1:99 (ΔN6:Hβ<sub>2</sub>m) at pH 7.2, 37°C while shaking at 200 rpm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). Whereas Hβ<sub>2</sub>m incubated alone does not form fibrils in the time frame of the experiment (100 days) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), consistent with previous results (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>), 50% (1:1), 10% (1:9), or even 1% (1:99) of ΔN6 is capable of catalyzing assembly of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into amyloid-like fibrils with lag times of ∼30 ± 3, ∼40 ± 8, and ∼75 ± 8 days, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C and data not shown). Crucially, these lag times are shorter than those obtained when the same concentration of ΔN6 is incubated alone (∼40 ± 5 days, ∼50 ± 7 days, and &gt;100 days [<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C and data not shown]), indicating that productive interactions between ΔN6 and Hβ<sub>2</sub>m catalyze assembly of the latter into amyloid fibrils. As a control experiment, wild-type murine β<sub>2</sub>m (Mβ<sub>2</sub>m) was incubated alone or was mixed to a total protein concentration of 80 μM with different concentrations of ΔN6 (50% [1:1], 10% [1:9], and 1% [1:99]) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A–5C). Mβ<sub>2</sub>m is 70% identical in sequence to Hβ<sub>2</sub>m but has been shown to be unable to assemble into amyloid fibrils at acidic pH (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>). No fibrils were observed when Mβ<sub>2</sub>m was incubated alone at pH 7.2, 37°C for 100 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Remarkably, the presence of stoichiometric concentrations of Mβ<sub>2</sub>m abolishes the ability of ΔN6 to form amyloid fibrils (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), and catalytic amounts (1%) of ΔN6 are not able to enhance amyloid formation from Mβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). To confirm these findings, the amount of soluble material remaining in each sample was quantified using SDS-PAGE and fibril formation was monitored using EM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A–5C). While all protein in 1:1 mixtures of ΔN6 and Mβ<sub>2</sub>m remained soluble (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), 100%, ∼50%, and ∼10% conversion of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into insoluble amyloid aggregates occurred when the protein was incubated with 50% (1:1), 10% (1:9), or 1% (1:99) ΔN6 (ΔN6:Hβ<sub>2</sub>m), respectively, consistent with the increased ThT fluorescence and the presence of fibrillar material in EM images of these samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C). The results indicate, therefore, that ΔN6 is able to convert Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into a conformer capable of forming amyloid fibrils even when added in catalytic amounts. Bimolecular collision of ΔN6 with the highly homologous Mβ<sub>2</sub>m protein, by contrast, abolishes the aggregation potential of the truncated protein.</p>

        <title>Atomistic Description of Conformational Conversion by Bimolecular Collision of ΔN6 and Hβ<sub>2</sub>m</title>
        <p>To probe the molecular mechanism of conformational conversion of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m to an amyloidogenic state, backbone dynamics of <sup>15</sup>N-Hβ<sub>2</sub>m in the absence or presence of <sup>14</sup>N-ΔN6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) were assessed using <sup>15</sup>N NMR R<sub>2</sub> measurements at pH 6.2, 37°C. These experiments revealed that adding <sup>14</sup>N-ΔN6 to <sup>15</sup>N-Hβ<sub>2</sub>m increases the <sup>15</sup>N relaxation rates of residues 13–22 in the AB-loop of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m substantially (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6C) in a pH-dependent manner (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A). Addition of equivalent concentrations of <sup>14</sup>N-Hβ<sub>2</sub>m or <sup>14</sup>N-Mβ<sub>2</sub>m has no effect on the R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates of <sup>15</sup>N-Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating that the interaction of ΔN6 with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m is specifically able to alter the dynamics of the latter protein. Note that the enhanced R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates of residues in the AB-loop of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m in the presence of ΔN6 are not accompanied by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N chemical shift alterations (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B), implying that the concentration of the encounter complex between Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6 is low (&lt;5%) and its formation occurs on an intermediate NMR timescale (∼milliseconds).</p>
        <p>The AB-loop (residues 13–22) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) has been shown to adopt different conformations in different crystal structures of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, dependent on the contacts made in the crystal lattice (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ricagno et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, it has been proposed that Pro14, which introduces rigidity into the AB-loop (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), may play a role in triggering a conformational switch wherein the A strand is displaced toward a more open protein conformation (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rosano et al., 2004</xref>). As shown above, such a conformational transition would favor relaxation of the X-Pro32 <italic>cis</italic>-peptide bond to the <italic>trans</italic>-isomer by providing the conformational freedom required for the structural changes linked to this isomerization event to occur. To determine whether the increased dynamics of the AB-loop of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m induced by the presence of ΔN6 is linked to displacement of the A-strand, the hydrogen exchange (HX) rates of individual residues of <sup>15</sup>N-Hβ<sub>2</sub>m, alone or mixed with a molar equivalent of <sup>14</sup>N-ΔN6, were determined at pH 6.2, 37°C (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The results revealed a 2- to 3-fold increase in the HX rates of residues in the N-terminal region of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m in the presence of <sup>14</sup>N-ΔN6 (exemplified by Tyr10, Asn24, Tyr26, and Ser28 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D) compared to Hβ<sub>2</sub>m alone. By contrast, little effect (&lt;1.5-fold) was observed for other residues in the protein (exemplified by Leu64 and Lys91 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The data thus show that bimolecular collision of ΔN6 with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m increases the conformational dynamics of the N-terminal region of the protein, which permits the isomerization of the X-Pro32 bond and switches on the pathway toward the amyloid state.</p>

        <title>Role of the N Terminus in the Folding and Stabilization of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m</title>
        <p>A key question in understanding amyloidosis is the nature of the early conformational changes that tip the equilibrium from correct folding toward the population of amyloidogenic species. Furthermore, how bimolecular collisions between a native protein and a misfolded or nonnative state enable conversion of an initially innocuous protein into an amyloidogenic conformation remains poorly understood at a molecular level. Here, we have used ΔN6 to investigate these phenomena. The solution structure of ΔN6 shows that this amyloidogenic protein retains a native-like structure, revealing that structural considerations alone cannot explain the enhanced amyloidogenic potential of this variant. Examination of the solution structures of native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6, nonetheless, reveals significant side-chain rearrangements comprising more than half of the protein's core that occur when the X-Pro32 peptide bond isomerizes to its <italic>trans</italic>-state, some of which involve residues shown hitherto to undergo structural changes in conformers of β<sub>2</sub>m trapped in protein crystals (<xref rid="bib15 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Eakin et al., 2006; Calabrese et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the structural similarities of ΔN6 in solution and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-bound β<sub>2</sub>m observed crystallographically (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>C–S2E), only ΔN6 is able to form amyloid fibrils efficiently in vitro (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>), suggesting that differences in structure and/or dynamics of these species are critical in endowing the potential to form amyloid.</p>
        <p>While ΔN6 retains a native topology and is only marginally destabilized compared with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (ΔΔG°<sub>UN</sub> = 3.8 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eichner and Radford, 2009</xref>), removal of the N-terminal six residues disrupts the kinetic stability of the protein, such that it is no longer strongly protected from HX (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>C) and interconverts rapidly with other conformers on a microsecond-to-millisecond timescale, as revealed by its enhanced R<sub>2</sub> values compared with Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). Furthermore, the absence of well-resolved resonances for residues 1–7 in I<sub>T</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) suggests that these residues are not natively attached to the protein in this folding intermediate. The N-terminal residues of β<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A, shown in blue) thus act as a postassembly clamp, side chains in this region stabilizing residues in the BC-loop and its main chain forming hydrogen bonds to the adjacent native β strand B. These interactions lock the X-Pro32 peptide bond in the <italic>cis</italic>-isomer, preventing its isomerization to the relaxed <italic>trans</italic>-form and the consequent release of the side chain of Phe30 from the hydrophobic core that, together, initiate a cascade of events that opens up the pathway toward aggregation. Proline-mediated loop dynamics associated with protein assembly have been observed in a number of protein systems in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that proline-mediated triggering of amyloidosis is not unique to β<sub>2</sub>m. For example, a misfolded conformer of human immunoglobulin light chain (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">O'Nuallain et al., 2007</xref>), an amyloid intermediate of stefin B (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jenko Kokalj et al., 2007</xref>), and the cell-cycle protein p13suc1 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rousseau et al., 2001</xref>) have all been shown to possess aggregation mechanisms dependent on isomerization of X-Pro bonds.</p>

        <title>ΔN6: An In Vivo Culprit of DRA</title>
        <p>Despite the fact that β<sub>2</sub>m is among the most extensively studied proteins involved in human amyloid disease (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Platt and Radford, 2009</xref>), the initiating factors in DRA remain unclear. Many scenarios have been suggested, including partial unfolding of β<sub>2</sub>m on the collagen surface, mild acidification in arthritic joints, stabilization of rare fibrils that may form from Hβ<sub>2</sub>m by glycosamingoglycans (<xref rid="bib17 bib58 bib14 bib34 bib36 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2004b; Eakin and Miranker, 2005; Mimmi et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2006; Relini et al., 2006</xref>), as well as mechanisms involving the addition of metal ions, lipids, or other factors that enhance the initial unfolding events required for assembly to occur (<xref rid="bib57 bib14 bib38 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2004a; Eakin and Miranker, 2005; Ohhashi et al., 2005; Sasahara et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we have shown that ΔN6 is a highly amyloidogenic species that is able to nucleate fibrillogenesis efficiently in vitro at neutral pH. This observation rationalizes the lack of circulating ΔN6 in the serum of patients with renal dysfunction and, given the natural affinity of ΔN6 for collagen (which is enhanced relative to Hβ<sub>2</sub>m [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Giorgetti et al., 2005</xref>]), explains why assembly of fibrils occurs most readily in collagen-rich joints. Additionally, we show that the mild acidification, such as may occur in the synovial fluid of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Relini et al., 2006</xref>), has a dramatic effect in enhancing fibril formation of ΔN6 and its ability to convert Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into an amyloid-competent state by protonation of His84 and/or other residues in the protein. We propose that rather than being an innocuous postassembly event (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Monti et al., 2005</xref>), proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal region of β<sub>2</sub>m could be a key initiating event in DRA. Such cleavage enables the formation of species that are not only able to assemble de novo into amyloid fibrils, which thereafter can enhance fibrillogenesis of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m by cross-seeding (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>), but when present in only catalytic amounts are also able to convert the wild-type protein into an amyloidogenic state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Conformational Conversion in Atomistic Detail</title>
        <p>A fascinating feature of amyloid fibrils is their ability to consume soluble monomer for self-replication via elongation with their own, or closely related, protein monomers. This suggests that amyloid fibrils or misfolded protein aggregates in general may have an inherent potential to convert innocuous protein conformers into amyloidogenic species, a feature famously associated with prions (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sindi and Serio, 2009</xref>). By exploring the dynamics and aggregation behavior of ΔN6, this study reveals that conformational excursions of ΔN6, which occur more frequently upon mild acidification, not only rationalize the inherent amyloidogenicity of this protein but also explain how this species is able to convert Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into an amyloidogenic state. By contrast, transient bimolecular collision between ΔN6 and Mβ<sub>2</sub>m abolishes the ability of ΔN6 to convert into amyloid fibrils.</p>
        <p>NMR analysis of bimolecular collisions between ΔN6 and Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A–6D) exposes atomistic details of one possible route of conformational conversion during amyloid formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). First, protonation of His84 and/or other amino acid side chains of ΔN6 under mild acidification enhances the aggregation potential of this already amyloidogenic protein (Step 1, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Next, specific bimolecular collision between ΔN6 and Hβ<sub>2</sub>m alters the dynamic properties of the AB-loop in Hβ<sub>2</sub>m that contains Pro14, which leads to partial fraying or displacement of the A-strand from the native β sandwich, with concomitant loss of HX protection in this region (Step 2). By this mechanism the X-Pro32 peptide bond becomes free to relax to the <italic>trans</italic>-isomer, triggering the cascade of events involved in the conversion of the constrained native protein to a dynamic amyloidogenic state (Step 3). Further assembly of monomers then leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils via one or more oligomeric species (Step 4). Correct docking of the A strand is thus crucial in trapping the native protein into a unique conformation and maintaining the concentration of amyloidogenic precursor states below that required for amyloid formation. Exploiting the power of NMR, we reveal here in atomistic detail how a nonnative protein conformer is able to convert an originally innocuous native protein species into an amyloidogenic state, opening the door to protein self-assembly and the onset of amyloidosis.</p>

        <p>(C) Comparison of the chemical shifts of ΔN6 and I<sub>T</sub> for the 76 <sup>1</sup>H or <sup>15</sup>N resonances that were identified in the spectrum of both species. Note that the chemical shift differences of ΔN6 and I<sub>T</sub> are more than one order of magnitude smaller than the chemical shift differences of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and ΔN6 (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C with <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D). Missing <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N resonances in the spectrum of I<sub>T</sub> (1–7, 29, 30, 33, 53, 55–61, 86, and 88) are either broadened due to intermediate exchange processes or degenerate with other residues. The rainbow ribbons and numbers above indicate β strands in Hβ<sub>2</sub>m calculated from the final set of 30 lowest-energy structures (PDB code 2XKS) using DSSPcont (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2003</xref>).

        <p>Turning On and Off β<sub>2</sub>m Amyloid Assembly</p>
        <p>(A) Summary showing the structures of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m and a model of I<sub>T</sub>. Above, keys for these conformational states. Native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m (leftmost), shown above as a circle with <italic>cis</italic>-X-Pro32 (green <bold>Γ</bold>), <italic>trans</italic>-X-Pro14 (blue <bold>Γ</bold>), His84 (red circle), and the N-terminal region (residues 1–6, in blue). Upon dissociation of the N-terminal region, the X-Pro32 bond is free to relax into the <italic>trans</italic>-conformation, causing further conformational changes that lead to the formation of the nonnative I<sub>T</sub> conformer (shown as a circle above a model of its structure). Protonation of His84 (shown in red and as a red circle above), which lies adjacent to Pro32 under mildly acidic conditions, further enhances the amyloid potential of I<sub>T</sub>. Oligomerization of these aggregation-prone species then leads to the formation of β<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils. Assuming that the fibrils formed at neutral pH are structurally similar to those formed at acidic pH, as suggested by FTIR (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jahn et al., 2008</xref>) and solid-state NMR (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Debelouchina et al., 2010</xref>), large conformational changes are required in order to transform the antiparallel β sheet arrangement of ΔN6 into the parallel in-register arrangement of β strands characteristic of β<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils, as reported recently (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ladner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>(B) Proposed mechanism of conformational conversion of Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into an amyloid-competent state by bimolecular collision with ΔN6. ΔN6 (shown schematically as a circle, using similar color schemes as in A) lacks the N-terminal six residues that clamp Hβ<sub>2</sub>m into its native structure. Protonation of His84 (shown as a red circle [unprotonated] or square [protonated]) occurs at mildly acidic pH. Possibly accompanied by alterations in the conformation/protonation status of other residues, the amyloidogenicity of ΔN6 is enhanced (Step 1). Bimolecular collision of one or more rarely populated conformers of ΔN6 with native Hβ<sub>2</sub>m leads to dissociation of the N-terminal region of the latter protein, allowing <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of X-Pro32 to occur (Step 2). Subsequent protonation of His84 in the wild-type protein is then favored, completing conformational conversion of I<sub>T</sub> (Step 3). Further protein-protein interactions between these species then allow nucleation and elongation of amyloid fibrils (Step 4).</p>
