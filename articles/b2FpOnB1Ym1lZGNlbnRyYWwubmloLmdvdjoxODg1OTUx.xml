        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The localization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the posterior of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte defines the site of assembly of the pole plasm, which contains the abdominal and germline determinants <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization requires the polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which depends on the recruitment of PAR-1 to the posterior cortex in response to a signal from the follicle cells, where it induces an enrichment of microtubule plus ends <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[4–7]</xref>. Here, we show that overexpressed <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localizes to the middle of the oocyte, as well as the posterior. This ectopic localization depends on the premature translation of Oskar protein, which recruits PAR-1 and microtubule-plus-end markers to the oocyte center instead of the posterior pole, indicating that Oskar regulates the polarity of the cytoskeleton. Oskar also plays a role in the normal polarization of the oocyte; mutants that disrupt <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization or translation strongly reduce the posterior recruitment of microtubule plus ends. Thus, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization is required to stabilize and amplify microtubule polarity, generating a positive feedback loop in which Oskar recruits PAR-1 to the posterior to increase the microtubule cytoskeleton's polarization, which in turn directs the localization of more <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA Causes Premature Translation of Oskar Protein and an Assembly of the Pole Plasm at an Ectopic Site</title>
        <p>During stage 9 of oogenesis, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localizes to the posterior of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, where it nucleates the pole plasm, which contains the determinants that specify the germ cells and abdomen at the posterior of the embryo <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. This localization depends on the RNA-binding proteins Staufen and HRP48 and on the exon-junction-complex components Mago nashi, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Barentsz <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[8–14]</xref>. In addition, the posterior accumulation of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA requires microtubules and the plus-end-directed microtubule motor protein, kinesin, suggesting that it is transported by kinesin toward microtubule plus ends at the posterior pole <xref rid="bib4 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[4, 15]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As part of a project to visualize the transport of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, we used the <italic>UAS-</italic>GAL4 expression system to overexpress <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in the female germline <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although increased amounts of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA are localized to the oocyte posterior in these <italic>UAS-osk</italic> females, a significant proportion of the mRNA is found in an ectopic dot in the middle of the oocyte in all stage 9 egg chambers (62/62) and more than half of those at stage 10A (80/150) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A–1D).</p>
        <p>The mislocalization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the center of the oocyte is reminiscent of the localization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA at stage 8 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that excess <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA saturates the transport pathway, causing a delay in its translocation to the posterior pole. We therefore examined the localization of other components of the <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization complex that are required for its transport to the posterior. Barentsz, Mago nashi, Staufen, and the Kinesin heavy chain all localize to the ectopic dot in the middle of the <italic>oskar</italic>-overexpressing oocytes, as well as to the posterior pole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>G–1N). Thus, none of these components appears to be limiting for transport to the posterior.</p>
        <p><italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is normally translationally repressed until it reaches the posterior pole, but overexpression of the <italic>oskar</italic> 3′ untranslated region (UTR) causes its premature translation <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We therefore examined whether this was also the case in the egg chambers overexpressing full-length <italic>oskar</italic> RNA. Oskar protein starts to accumulate at the posterior pole of wild-type egg chambers at stage 9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>O and 1P). In UAS-<italic>osk</italic> egg chambers, robust Oskar expression is already visible in the ectopic dot at stage 8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>Q). Thus, overexpressed <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is not translationally repressed, even though it has not reached the posterior. Furthermore, the ectopic Oskar protein recruits Vasa, indicating that the premature translation of Oskar initiates the formation of the pole plasm in the middle of the oocyte (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>R–1T).</p>
        <p>To test whether Oskar protein is required for the mislocalization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, we generated a second construct, UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-Stop, in which we introduced a stop codon at position K178, which is equivalent to the mutation in the <italic>oskar</italic> protein-null allele <italic>oskar</italic><sup>54</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E and 1F). When <italic>oskar</italic>-STOP mRNA is overexpressed, it rarely localizes to the middle of the oocyte (13/79 at stage 9; 11/96 at stage 10A), although it is overexpressed at similar levels to the wild-type UAS-<italic>oskar</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref> online). Thus, the formation of the ectopic dot seems to be mainly caused by Oskar protein, rather than saturation of the localization pathway. The expression of the UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP construct induces the premature translation of endogenous <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA (see below), and this may account for the low penetrance of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA mislocalization to the middle of these oocytes.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.2">
        <title>UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP Activates Endogenous <italic>oskar</italic> Translation</title>
        <p>Whereas <italic>oskar</italic> mutants block abdomen formation, extra copies of <italic>oskar</italic> cause the opposite bicaudal phenotype, in which the head and thorax are replaced by a mirror-image copy of the abdomen <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although <italic>UAS-osk</italic> females produce some bicaudal embryos, the vast majority show a more extreme phenotype, in which the gut and terminal structures are expanded at the expense of the cuticle (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>A–S1D, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). This is most probably because <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is very highly expressed in <italic>UAS-osk</italic> ovaries (equivalent to at least ten copies of <italic>oskar</italic>; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E), leading to Oskar and Nanos overexpression, which causes an expansion of the expression domains of the terminal-gap genes, <italic>tailless</italic> and <italic>huckebein</italic> (data not shown) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP gives rise to embryonic phenotypes similar to those of UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>, even though it cannot produce functional Oskar protein (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). A weaker bicaudal phenotype has been observed when the <italic>oskar-</italic>3′UTR is overexpressed, leading to the proposal that this RNA activates the translation of endogenous <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA by titrating out translational repressors <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To test whether this is also the case for UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP, we expressed the transgene in females that were transheterozygous for two <italic>oskar</italic> protein-null mutations (<italic>oskar</italic><sup>54</sup>/<italic>oskar</italic><sup>346</sup>). The resulting embryos showed a typical posterior-group phenotype that was indistinguishable from <italic>oskar</italic><sup>54</sup>/<italic>oskar</italic><sup>346</sup> alone (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Thus, UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP produces a bicaudal phenotype by activating the translation of endogenous wild-type <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA.</p>

        <title>Ectopic Pole Plasm Recruits Microtubule Plus Ends</title>
        <p>At stage 7 of oogenesis, a signal from the posterior follicle cells induces a reorganization of the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton, so that microtubules are then nucleated from the anterior and lateral cortex <xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[21–25]</xref>. The microtubule plus ends appear to localize to the middle of the oocyte during stages 7 and 8, as revealed by the localization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, Staufen, and Kin:β-GAL (a marker for the plus ends of the microtubules) <xref rid="bib4 bib17 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[4, 17, 26]</xref>. This organization is only temporary, however, and plus-end markers start to accumulate at the posterior cortex at the beginning of stage 9, coincident with the onset of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization to the posterior.</p>
        <p>The mislocalization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the center of UAS-<italic>oskar</italic> oocytes resembles the polarity phenotype produced by <italic>par-1</italic> hypomorphic mutant combinations, in which some of the microtubule plus ends localize to the middle of the oocyte, rather than the posterior pole <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5, 6]</xref>. We therefore examined the localization of the plus-end marker Kinesin-β-GAL in UAS-<italic>osk</italic> oocytes. Kinesin-β-GAL always localizes to an ectopic site in the center of these oocytes (18/18), as well as to the posterior, and colocalizes with Staufen, a marker for <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A–2F).</p>
        <p>The dynein/dynactin motor complex provides another marker for the polarity of the microtubules because it is localized by kinesin to the posterior of the oocyte independently of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA <xref rid="bib17 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[17, 27, 28]</xref>. This can be visualized with GFP-Dynamitin, a subunit of the Dynactin complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G–2I) <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. GFP-Dynamitin is mislocalized with Staufen to the ectopic dot in the middle of almost all <italic>oskar</italic>-overexpressing oocytes (16/18) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>J and 2K). Thus, two markers for microtubule plus ends colocalize with ectopic Oskar in the middle of the oocyte.</p>
        <p>The ectopic Oskar does not appear to interfere with the organization of the microtubule minus ends, or with minus-end-directed processes. The overall morphology of the microtubules is not affected when visualized with tubulin antibodies (not shown) or with a GFP-tagged version of the microtubule-binding protein Tau (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>C and S2D). In addition, the oocyte nucleus always migrates normally to the dorsal-anterior corner of the oocyte, and <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA shows a wild-type localization to the anterior cortex (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>A and S2B). Surprisingly, some <italic>gurken</italic> mRNA is often mislocalized to the posterior of UAS-<italic>oskar</italic> oocytes. It is not translated there, however, because Gurken protein is only found at the correct location adjacent to the oocyte nucleus (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>E–S2I). This phenotype requires high levels of Oskar protein because <italic>gurken</italic> mRNA is not mislocalized in UAS-<italic>oskar</italic>-STOP oocytes. These results suggest that prematurely translated Oskar protein and/or downstream components of the pole plasm somehow sequester <italic>gurken</italic> mRNA and take it with them to the posterior pole.</p>

      <sec id="sec1.4">
        <title>Oskar Is Required for the Normal Posterior Recruitment of Microtubule Plus Ends</title>
        <p>The results above indicate that Oskar protein recruits microtubule plus ends when overexpressed, raising the possibility that Oskar normally plays a role in the recruitment of plus ends to the posterior in wild-type oocytes. To test this hypothesis, we re-examined the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the absence of Oskar protein and in mutants that affect <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization and translation.</p>
        <p>The plus-end marker Kin:β-GAL localizes to a tight posterior crescent in most wild-type stage 9 oocytes (88%, n = 58), with 12% displaying a weaker enrichment at the posterior pole (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). In an <italic>oskar</italic> protein null, however, only 16% of the oocytes show a robust posterior localization of Kin:β-GAL, whereas 72% show a weak posterior enrichment, and 12% show no localization to the posterior at all (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). We also examined germline clones of <italic>btz<sup>2</sup></italic> and <italic>Khc<sup>27</sup></italic>, which completely disrupt <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization <xref rid="bib12 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[12, 15]</xref>. In these cases, the distribution of Kin:β-GAL in the mutant egg chambers can be directly compared with its localization in the heterozygous egg chambers from the same ovaries, which are stained under identical conditions. In each case, the mutant egg chambers show a highly penetrant reduction or loss of the posterior localization of Kin:β-GAL compared to the nonmutant controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G–3O, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). These results are in good agreement with those of Brendza et al, who noted that Kin:β-GAL is not detectably localized in a significant fraction of <italic>Khc</italic> mutant oocytes <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, the posterior recruitment of plus ends is strongly impaired when Oskar protein is absent from the posterior pole.</p>

        <title>Oskar May Reinforce Oocyte Polarity by Recruiting Par-1</title>
        <p>The mechanism that recruits microtubule plus ends to the posterior pole at stage 9 is not well understood, but depends on the function of the conserved polarity kinase PAR-1 <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5, 6]</xref>. In contrast to the wild-type, microtubules are nucleated all around the oocyte cortex of <italic>par-1</italic> mutants, and the plus ends are focused at the center instead of the posterior pole. As a consequence, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is mislocalized to the middle of the oocyte, and the resulting embryos lack an abdomen and germline. PAR-1 plays a similar role in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian epithelial cells, indicating that one of its major functions is in the establishment of polarized microtubule arrays <xref rid="bib30 bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[30–32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The PAR-1N1 short and long isoforms appear to play the major role in the polarization of the oocyte cytoskeleton because only these fully rescue the polarity defects of <italic>par-1</italic> hypomorphs, and GFP-tagged PAR-1N1S and L are recruited to the posterior cortex of the oocyte at stage 7, making them the earliest markers for polarization of the anterior-posterior axis <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This localization is more cortical than that of the pole plasm and is not disrupted in <italic>staufen</italic>, <italic>mago nashi</italic>, and <italic>Kinesin heavy chain</italic> mutants, indicating that it is independent of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization. Antibody stainings fail to detect the cortical PAR-1, perhaps because it is of too low abundance, but recognize a second population of PAR-1, which colocalizes to the posterior with the pole plasm <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5, 6]</xref>. This localization is disrupted in <italic>oskar</italic> and <italic>staufen</italic> mutants, but not <italic>vasa</italic> mutants, suggesting that PAR-1 is recruited by Oskar protein. These results suggest that <italic>oskar</italic> overexpression may interfere with polarity by recruiting PAR-1 to the center of the oocyte. In support of this view, antibody stainings revealed a strong localization of PAR-1 to the dot in the middle of the oocyte in <italic>UAS-osk</italic>-overexpressing flies (100%, n = 16; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4F). GFP-PAR-1N1S does not colocalize with ectopic Oskar in the center of the oocyte, however, consistent with the previous observation that this isoform is recruited to the posterior cortex, but not the pole plasm <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We also tested whether UAS-<italic>oskar</italic> enhances the phenotype of a weak <italic>par-1</italic> mutant combination. Flies transheterozygous for the two hypomorphic <italic>par-1</italic> alleles, <italic>par-1<sup>6323</sup></italic> and <italic>par-1<sup>6821</sup></italic>, have mild polarity defects, in which <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA and Staufen protein are mislocalized to the center of the oocyte in 56% (n = 136) of egg chambers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G–4J, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Despite this mislocalization, Stau is also visibly enriched at the posterior pole of the oocyte in the majority of cases (88%). In contrast, <italic>par-1<sup>6323</sup></italic>/<italic>par-1<sup>6821</sup></italic> oocytes that also overexpress <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA show a much stronger phenotype: Stau protein is visibly enriched at the posterior pole of the oocyte in only 27% (n = 37) of these egg chambers and is mislocalized all around the oocyte cortex in most cases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>J; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). In addition, these flies do not lay any eggs because of these severe defects in oogenesis. Thus, <italic>oskar</italic> overexpression strongly enhances the phenotype of a weak <italic>par-1</italic> mutant combination, most probably because ectopic Oskar protein recruits some of the limited amount of PAR-1 away from the posterior to the oocyte center.</p>
        <p>Although <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization has always been presumed to be downstream of the polarization of the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton, here we show through both gain- and loss-of-function experiments that it also plays an active role in this process, through the recruitment of microtubule plus ends by Oskar protein. PAR-1 is a good candidate to be the effector of Oskar function in plus-end recruitment because it is required for the polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and is recruited by Oskar protein to the posterior of the oocyte. Furthermore, the polarity phenotype of <italic>par-1</italic> hypomorphs is strongly enhanced by <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA overexpression, suggesting that PAR-1 and Oskar function in the same pathway to regulate the microtubules.</p>
        <p>On the basis of our results, we would like to suggest a revised model for how the polarity of the oocyte is established (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). The polarization of the oocyte is initiated by the posterior-follicle-cell signal, which induces the localization of the PAR-1N1 isoforms to the posterior cortex. This localized PAR-1 then recruits or stabilizes some microtubule plus ends at the posterior cortex, leading to the kinesin-dependent transport of a small amount of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA from the center of the oocyte to the posterior pole. Once <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA reaches the posterior, its translational repression is relieved, and the resulting Oskar protein recruits another population of PAR-1 to the posterior. This PAR-1 can then recruit further microtubule plus ends, which in turn direct the posterior localization of more <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA. Thus, Oskar protein initiates a positive feedback loop that amplifies the polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, leading to an increase in the localization of its own mRNA. The microtubule polarity is not reinforced in <italic>oskar</italic> protein-null mutants or in mutants that disrupt the localization of translation of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, and this results in only a partial polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. On the other hand, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA overexpression and premature translation in the middle of the oocyte initiates the positive feedback loop in the wrong place. As a consequence, PAR-1 recruits some of the microtubule plus ends to the center of the oocyte and away from the posterior pole. PAR-1 has also been shown to stabilize Oskar protein through direct phosphorylation <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This therefore generates a second positive feedback loop that further reinforces the posterior localization of PAR-1, Oskar protein, and microtubule plus ends.</p>
        <p>Amplification through positive feedback loops appears to be an emerging theme in cell polarity. For example, the polarization of migrating neutrophils depends on the local enrichment of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PtdInsP<sub>3</sub>) at the leading edge of the cell, and this is amplified by a Rho-dependent positive feedback loop, in which PtdInsP<sub>3</sub> recruits PtdIns-3-OH kinase to the leading edge, which in turn generates more PtdInsP<sub>3</sub> <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A similar mechanism operates during bud-site selection in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The bud site is defined by the localization of activated Cdc42-GTP, and this localization induces the assembly of actin cables that extend into the cytoplasm. This signal is then reinforced by the transport of more Cdc42-GTP along the actin cables to the bud site, where it can induce the assembly of further actin cables <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This mechanism is enhanced by a second feedback loop, in which Cdc42-GTP recruits the adaptor protein, Bem1, which binds Cdc24, which activates Cdc42 <xref rid="bib36 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[36, 37]</xref>. Our results add a third example of the use of multiple feedback loops to reinforce an initially weak cell polarity, and they provide the first case where this amplification involves the microtubule cytoskeleton rather than actin.</p>

        <p>Overexpression of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA Causes Its Mislocalization and Premature Translation in the Middle of the Oocyte</p>
        <p>(A–F) Fluorescence in situ hybridizations to <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in wild-type (A and B), <italic>UAS-osk</italic> (C and D) and <italic>UAS-osk-Stop</italic> (E and F) stage 9 oocytes ([B], [D], and [F] were obtained by overlaying confocal pseudo differential-interference-contrast images with the in situ stainings [red channel] from the top panel [A, C, and E]). Overexpressed <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is localized to both the posterior pole and an ectopic site in the middle of the <italic>UAS-osk</italic> oocytes. In flies overexpressing an untranslatable version of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA (<italic>UAS-osk-Stop</italic>), the incidence of the ectopic localization is reduced, and most egg chambers show a wild-type pattern of localization (E and F).</p>
        <p>(G–N) Immunostainings for the Kinesin heavy chain (G and H), Stau (I and J), and localization of GFP-tagged variants of Mago nashi (K and L) and Barentsz (M and N) in wild-type (G, I, K, and M) and <italic>UAS-osk</italic> egg chambers (H, J, L, and N). All these components of the <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization complex are mislocalized to the center of the oocyte with overexpressed <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA. The asterisk in (L) indicates the strong accumulation of Mago:GFP in the oocyte nucleus.</p>
        <p>(O–Q) Immunostainings for Oskar protein. In wild-type egg chambers, Oskar protein is not expressed at stage 8 (O) and is first translated at the posterior pole of the oocyte at stage 9 (P). In <italic>UAS-osk</italic> oocytes, Oskar protein is translated in the middle of the oocyte at stage 8 (Q).</p>
        <p>(R–T) Immunostainings for Vasa protein. Oskar recruits Vasa protein to the posterior of the oocyte at stage 9 in wild-type egg chambers (R and S). In <italic>UAS-osk</italic> oocytes, the ectopic Oskar in the middle of the oocyte recruits Vasa at stage 8 (T).</p>

        <p>Oskar Is Required for the Efficient Recruitment of the Microtubule Plus Ends to the Posterior Pole</p>
        <p>(A–C) Wild-type: the plus-end marker, Kin:β-GAL, localizes to the posterior pole of the oocyte at stage 9 ([A], red in [C]) and colocalizes with Staufen ([B], green in [C]).</p>
        <p>(D–E) <italic>osk<sup>54</sup>/Df</italic>: The posterior localization of Kin:β-GAL ([D], red in [F]) and Staufen ([E], green in [F]) is strongly reduced in an <italic>oskar</italic> protein-null mutant.</p>
        <p>(G–I) A nonrecombinant <italic>btz</italic><sup>2</sup>/+ egg chamber from a germline clone experiment, showing a robust localization of Kin:β-GAL ([G], red in [I]) and Staufen ([H], blue in [I]) to the posterior pole. GFP staining is shown in green in the merged image (I) and marks the nonrecombinant wild-type cells. The signal in the nurse cells indicates that this is not a germline clone.</p>
        <p>(J–L) A <italic>btz</italic><sup>2</sup> germline clone marked by the loss of GFP (green in [L]) from the same experiment as in (G)–(I). Kin:β-GAL (J) is barely detectable at the posterior of the oocyte, whereas Staufen (K) is not localized to the posterior pole, and accumulates at the anterior of the oocyte and diffusely around the oocyte cortex, consistent with the complete absence of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization to the posterior pole in this mutant.</p>
        <p>(M–O) A <italic>Khc</italic><sup>27</sup> germline clone stained as above. Kin:β-GAL (M) is only very weakly localized to the posterior, whereas Staufen (O) fails to localize there and is mislocalized to the oocyte anterior-lateral cortex, where <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is detected in <italic>Khc</italic><sup>27</sup> mutants. Also note the misplacement of the oocyte nucleus, labeled with the asterisk; this misplacement reflects the requirement for Kinesin in nuclear anchoring <xref rid="bib28 bib29 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[28, 29, 38]</xref>.</p>

        <p>PAR-1 May Mediate Plus-End Recruitment by Oskar Protein</p>
        <p>(A–C) Wild-type: An immunostaining for PAR-1 ([A], red in [C]) shows its localization to the posterior with GFP-Staufen ([B], green in [C]).</p>
        <p>(D–F) UAS-<italic>osk</italic>: Overexpression of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA leads to the recruitment of PAR-1 ([D], red in [F]) and GFP-Staufen ([E], green in [F]) to the middle of the oocyte.</p>
        <p>(G) An immunostaining for Stau protein shows its localization to the posterior pole of a wild-type oocyte.</p>
        <p>(H) In the hypomorphic mutant combination, <italic>par-1<sup>6323</sup>/ par-1<sup>6821</sup></italic>, some Staufen is occasionally mislocalized to the middle of the oocyte.</p>
        <p>(I) In <italic>UAS-osk</italic>/GAL4, the overexpression of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA also induces mislocalization of Staufen to the oocyte center.</p>
        <p>(J) <italic>par-1<sup>6323</sup>/ par-1<sup>6821</sup></italic>; <italic>UAS-osk</italic>: <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA overexpression strongly enhances the weak <italic>par-1</italic> phenotype, leading to the complete loss of Staufen localization to the posterior.</p>
