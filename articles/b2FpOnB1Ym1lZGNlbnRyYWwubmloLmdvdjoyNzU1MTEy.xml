          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>Megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation is a multistep process through which hematopoietic progenitor cells develop into mature megakaryocytes (MKs) and form proplatelets. The present study investigates the regulation of different steps of megakaryopoiesis (i.e., differentiation, migration, and proplatelet formation) by extracellar signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in two models of primary murine MKs derived from bone marrow (BM) cells and fetal liver (FL) cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Materials and Methods</title>
          <p>A preparation of MKs was generated from BM obtained from femora and tibiae of C57BL6 mice. FL-derived MKs were obtained from the liver of mouse fetuses aged 13 to 15 days.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>For both cell populations, activation of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by thrombopoietin was found to have a critical role in MK differentiation, regulating polyploidy and surface expression of CD34, GPIIb, and GPIb. The MEK-ERK1/2 pathway plays a major role in migration of BM-derived MKs toward a stromal-cell−derived factor 1α (SDF1α) gradient, whereas unexpectedly, FL-derived cells fail to migrate in response to the chemokine due to negligible expression of its receptor, CXCR4. The MEK-ERK1/2 pathway also plays a critical role in the generation of proplatelets. In contrast, p38MAPK pathway was not involved in any of these processes.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Megakaryopoiesis is a tightly controlled multistep process of proliferation and differentiation involving commitment of hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells to megakaryocyte (MK) precursors followed by maturation and (pro)platelet formation. During development, MKs undergo a series of transformations that can be identified by expression of surface proteins, including GPIIb (also known as the integrin subunit αIIb or CD41) and GPIb (CD42b), in association with nuclear maturation characterized by successive rounds of endomitosis and subsequent cytoplasmic maturation. The end result is large polyploid MKs, characterized by long, branching cytoplasmic extensions called proplatelets, which give rise to platelets <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1−3]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a crucial regulator of megakaryocytic growth and differentiation in vitro and in vivo, exerting its effects through its receptor, c-Mpl <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[4−7]</xref>. c-Mpl signals via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Shc-Ras−mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways <xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>. Several studies have reported a critical role for JAK2 and STAT5 in mediating MK development downstream of c-Mpl. Further, the V617F mutant of JAK2 is the causative mutation in approximately 50% of patients with the myeloproliferative disorder, essential thrombocythemia (ET), which is characterized by an increase in platelet count <xref rid="bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[11−13]</xref>.</p>
    <p>MAPKs are serine/threonine kinases that comprise extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38MAPKs and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) families <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which are activated by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. These three MAPK pathways are implicated in proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis of a wide variety of cells. The importance of the ERK1/2 pathway in MK differentiation was analyzed by expression of constitutively active or dominant-negative mutants of the upstream regulator of ERK1/2 kinases, MEK, and by use of pharmacological inhibitors of MEK (e.g., PD98059 and U0126) in immortalized megakaryocytic cell lines, including UT7-TPO <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, K562 <xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[16−18]</xref>, CMK <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and in primary human MKs derived from cord or peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells <xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[20−23]</xref> and primary mouse bone marrow (BM)−derived MKs <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A general consensus is that the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway acts as a regulator of differentiation in MKs, principally promoting polyploidization in the later developmental stage <xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19 bib21 bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[15−19,21,23,24]</xref>. Conflicting results on the role of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway on the differentiation of primary MKs have been published <xref rid="bib20 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[20,22]</xref>. In addition, inhibition of ERK1/2 has been shown to increase <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, inhibit <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, or have no effect <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> on proplatelet formation in different MK models. These discrepancies may be due to the experimental conditions, the source of cells, or the concentration of the MEK inhibitors. In comparison, the role of the p38MAPK pathway in MK growth and differentiation has not been as extensively investigated and its various roles, if any, remain unclear <xref rid="bib23 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[23,28,29]</xref>.</p>
    <p>This present study was undertaken to directly compare two primary mouse MK models derived from BM- and fetal liver (FL)-progenitor cells using established culture methods. The role of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways in MK differentiation, migration, and proplatelet formation has been analyzed.</p>

The proportion of mature MKs in the enriched population was estimated to be &gt;60% (data not shown). To study the role of MAPKs in differentiation, inhibitors were added at the same time as TPO, and this was taken as the beginning of the differentiation process. The inhibitor was then given again after 24 hours at the same concentration (see <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E1</xref> [online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>] for time course of differentiation and addition of reagents).

        <title>ERK1/2 is activated in response to TPO in primary BM- and FL-derived MKs</title>
        <p>Suspensions of mature BM- and FL-derived MKs were generated by culturing freshly isolated hematopoietic progenitor cells with TPO for 4 or 5 days, respectively, and subsequent purification using a BSA gradient. Different time points were used for the two populations, as the BM-derived MKs were found to consistently reach a higher level of maturity more rapidly that the FL-derived MKs. The ability of TPO to activate the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in mature MKs was investigated by Western blotting. BM- and FL-derived MKs display a rapid and transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon stimulation by TPO, which peaks at 5 to 10 minutes, before returning to almost basal levels by 120 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>A and B; left-hand panels). The decline in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was noticeably more rapid in the BM-derived MKs. In both populations, phosphorylation of ERK2 (corresponding to the lower band) was more marked than ERK1. A similar set of observations were previously reported for murine BM-derived MKs by Rojnuckarin et al. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These studies were also performed on immature MKs at day 2 of differentiation, by which time the maximal ploidy was 16N for the BM-derived cells and 8 N for the FL-derived cells. A similar profile of ERK1/2 activation to that in the mature cells was observed but with a more rapid decline to the baseline by 30 minutes in both cases (data not shown). Basal and TPO-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was inhibited completely in the presence of the structurally distinct MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD184161 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>A and B; right-hand panels).</p>

        <title>ERK1/2-mediates differentiation of primary BM- and FL-derived MKs independent of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)</title>
        <p>The effect of inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway on BM- and FL-derived MK differentiation was investigated using the specific MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD184161. Progenitors cells isolated from BM and FL were treated with the two inhibitors along with TPO at the beginning of the differentiation process. The inhibitor was also given 24 hours later as outlined in <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure E1</xref> (online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>). Following differentiation of BM- and FL-derived cells for 4 or 5 days, respectively, the expression of the surface glycoproteins CD34, GPIIb, and GPIb, and the degree of polyploidy were examined. Flow cytometry profiles of the whole-cell population prior to separation on the BSA gradient revealed that the percentage of cells expressing GPIIb in the two models was unchanged after treatment with UO126 or PD184161 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that ERK1/2 is not involved in the early stage of MK differentiation in either model. Conversely, inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 induced, in both models, a significant increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD34 and a corresponding reduction in those expressing the late MK marker, GPIb (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway also reduced the overall DNA content (polyploidization) in the BSA gradient−enriched population of MKs, as analyzed by flow cytometry after anti-GPIIb labeling and propidium iodide staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>A and B). In the case of BM-derived MKs, this was associated with an increase in polyploidy levels between 8N and 16N and a reduction in cells with ploidy values of 64N or 128N (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Although FL-derived MKs only generated ploidy levels up to 64N (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) compare to 128N for BM-derived MKs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway caused a marked reduction in the percentage of cells with polyploidy levels between 8N and 64N (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). The modal ploidy of BM- and FL-derived MKs was also reduced following inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>A and B). These data are in agreement with the morphological analysis using May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining, which demonstrated a decrease in the MK size and in the number of nuclear lobes in treated cells compared to control cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway plays a major role in the late stage differentiation of both BM- and FL-derived MKs and is critical for full polyploidization.</p>
        <p>Many direct substrates of ERK1/2 are transcription factors and kinases, including the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases, RSK1−4. We therefore investigated the effect of a naturally occurring RSK inhibitor<italic>,</italic> SL0101 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, on development of BM- and FL-derived MKs. In neither cell population did the inhibition of RSK using SL0101 (10 μM) induce a change in expression of the surface glycoproteins CD34, GPIIb, and GPIb, or in the degree of ploidy (<xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E2</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>), demonstrating that regulation of megakaryopoiesis by TPO is not mediated through activation of RSK.</p>

        <title>p38MAPK is not required for MK differentiation</title>
        <p>A similar set of studies to those described here were carried out in BM- and FL-derived MKs to investigate a possible role for the p38MAPK pathway in differentiation. p38MAPK is constitutively phosphorylated in both BM- and FL-derived MKs and undergoes a decrease in phosphorylation upon TPO stimulation at 30 and 90 minutes, respectively (<xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E3A</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>). In view of the constitutive activation of p38MAPK, we investigated the effect of the p38MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, on MK differentiation. These experiments were performed alongside controls in the presence of indomethacin in view of the ability of SB203580 to block cyclooxygenase <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Treatment with SB203580 (10 μM) using the same protocol as that for inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway had no effect on expression of CD34, GPIb, and GPIIb markers, or on the degree of ploidy in either BM or FL-derived MKs relative to controls (data not shown and <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E3B</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>).

        <title>ERK1/2 is involved in MKmigration in response to SDF1α gradient</title>
        <p>It is recognized that as MKs mature and differentiate in the BM, they migrate to sinusoidal BM endothelial cells, where they form transendothelial projections called proplatelets <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. In turn, these give rise to platelets, either before or after release of proplatelets into the circulation. SDF1α is the major chemotactic agent involved in regulation of MK migration to the BM niche <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This stage of megakaryopoiesis can be followed in vitro by monitoring migration of MK on fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix component in BM <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, toward a gradient of SDF1α using a Dunn chamber. We have used this approach to compare the ability of mature MKs grown from BM and FL progenitors for 4 days or 5 days, respectively, to migrate along a SDF1α gradient.</p>
        <p>In agreement with our previous results <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, BM-derived MKs migrate toward a gradient of SDF1α, whereas, in contrast, FL-derived MKs do not migrate under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E4, videos 1 and 2</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>). To investigate a possible explanation for this difference, we measured the transcript and the protein cell surface levels of the SDF1α receptor, CXCR4, in both MK populations. CXCR4 transcript level analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR were comparable in both models (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), whereas flow cytometry showed a robust surface expression of CXCR4 in BM-derived MKs, but a negligible level on the FL-derived mature MK surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B), thereby accounting for the inability of these cells to migrate to SDF1α. A negligible level of CXCR4 was also found on immature BM- and FL-derived cells (data not shown). BM-derived progenitor cells, therefore, express an increase in CXCR4 surface as megakaryocytic differentiation proceeds, which are not observed in the FL cell model. Consequently, we restricted our investigation of the role of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK in migration to the population of BM-derived MKs. Administration of the MEK inhibitor PD184161 (10 μM) to the Dunn chamber caused the cells to move relatively short distances and to more readily change direction compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E4, video 3</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>), suggesting a lack of directed chemotaxis in response to SDF1α. In contrast, inhibition of p38MAPK using SB203580 had no effect on MK migration (<xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. E3C and Fig. E4, videos 4 and 5</xref>, online only, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.exphem.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.exphem.org</ext-link>). These results demonstrate a critical role for ERK1/2 activation in migration of BM-derived MKs.</p>

        <title>ERK1/2 is required for proplatelet formation</title>
        <p>MKs were grown to maturity from BM- and FL-derived progenitors for 4 days and 5 days respectively, purified by BSA gradient and then allowed to generate proplatelets on an immobilized fibrinogen surface over a period of 5 hours. Although both populations of MKs were able to generate proplatelets, approximately three times the number of proplatelet-forming MKs were observed in the FL-derived population, correlated to an increase of the total surface area of the proplatelet network (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). As a consequence, we restricted our investigation of the role of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in proplatelet formation to the FL-derived MKs. Inhibition of this pathway using two specific inhibitors, U0126 and PD184161, reduced the number of proplatelet-forming MKs by &gt;50%, with a corresponding reduction in proplatelet area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). In contrast, inhibition of p38MAPK using SB203580 had no significant effect on the formation of proplatelets in comparison to the indomethacin-treated control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). Together, these results suggest that ERK1/2 activation is required in the process of proplatelet formation, whereas p38MAPK is not involved. Interestingly, we observed ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both MK populations at 1 hour after their adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, which returns to basal level by 5 hours (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have compared the ability of BM- and FL-derived MKs to differentiate, migrate toward a gradient of SDF1α, and generate proplatelets. The role of MEK-ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways in these processes has been investigated. The results demonstrate a critical role for the ERK1/2 pathway, but not p38MAPK, in all of these processes, as well as several differences in the behavior of the two cell populations, of which the most notable was the failure of the FL-derived cells to migrate toward a gradient SDF1α due to a negligible level of CXCR4 receptor surface expression.</p>
      <p>MK differentiation is characterized by expression of specific megakaryocytic surface glycoproteins and nuclear maturation, resulting in large polyploidy cells. In this study, the role of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in the differentiation of BM- and FL-derived MK was investigated using relatively low concentrations of these two structurally distinct MEK inhibitors, UO126 and PD186141. Inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is sufficient to induce an increase of expression of the immature marker CD34 and a decrease in the late MK commitment marker, GPIb, without affecting expression of the early megakaryocytic marker GPIIb. Furthermore, inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway causes a leftward shift of the ploidy of the cells, showing a critical requirement of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in late stage of MK differentiation. In contrast, the p38MAPK does not contribute to MK differentiation. Indeed, Miyazaki et al. has shown that, in cord blood primary MK, p38MAPK is required for TPO-induced erythroid differentiation and not for MK differentiation <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During megakaryopoiesis, differentiating MKs migrate within the complex BM stromal environment from the endosteal niche to the BM sinusoidal endothelial cells, the site of platelet formation. The chemokine SDF1α augments this motility and promotes the interaction of MKs with the BM vascular niche and, therefore, supports thrombopoiesis <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, we show that, contrary to BM-derived MKs, MKs derived from FL are not able to migrate in response to SDF1α because of a negligible level of CXCR4 cell surface expression, despite comparable level expression of CXCR4 gene in both models. This suggests a different regulation of megakaryopoiesis in these two models. One potential physiological explanation for this is that MKs in the liver do not need to migrate to release platelets because of a highly vascular environment. In contrast, within the complex BM microenvironment, MKs needs to migrate from the proliferative osteoblastic niche to the capillary-rich vascular niche to release platelets. Previous studies have revealed that MAPKs are important factors in the regulation of cell migration in numerous cell types in response to cell matrix proteins, growth factors, or cytokines <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate a critical role for ERK1/2, but not p38MAPK, in MK movement and chemotaxis in response to SDF1α. The defective migration might be explained by the altered polarization of the SDF1α receptor CXCR4, as shown previously <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, ERK1/2 may govern cell movement by phosphorylating the myosin light-chain kinase, the protease calpain, or the focal adhesion kinase. These phosphorylations regulate the dynamics of focal adhesions and the reorganization of cytoskeleton, which are critical for cell migration <xref rid="bib39 bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">[39−41]</xref>. Further studies will focus upon elucidating the precise mechanisms by which ERK1/2 control cell migration.</p>
      <p>The role of MEK-ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways in the terminal stage of megakaryopoiesis, proplatelet formation, was also investigated. An increased proportion of FL-derived MKs generate proplatelets compared to BM-derived MKs, perhaps reflecting the need to generate a large number of platelets in parallel to development of the vasculature in the fetus, whereas in contrast, the role of BM-derived MKs is to maintain a steady-state platelet production. Interestingly, in culture conditions, BM-derived MKs present a higher ploidy, but form fewer proplatelets than FL-derived MKs, suggesting that a higher threshold of MK maturation may be necessary to achieve proplatelet formation in BM. The present study also demonstrates that MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, but not p38MAPK, is required for proplatelet generation. It is now well-established that dynamic regulation of microtubules is essential for proplatelet formation <xref rid="bib42 bib43 bib44" ref-type="bibr">[42−44]</xref> and that microtubule-associated protein, which are well-characterized substrates of MAPKs <xref rid="bib45 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[45,46]</xref>, play a major role in microtubule dynamics <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. One of the potential mechanisms implicating ERK1/2 in proplatelet formation is therefore the regulation of the phosphorylation states of the microtubule-associated proteins and subsequent organization of the microtubule network.</p>
      <p>In summary, we provide evidence for the critical role of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, but not p38MAPK, in MK differentiation, migration, and proplatelet formation, and describe several differences in the behavior of the two primary MK populations from BM and FL. Further experiments are required to identify and confirm the roles of the substrates of ERK1/2 that underlie these effects.</p>

Four or five days after addition of TPO, expression of CD34, GPIIb, and GPIb were evaluated by flow cytometry in the whole-cell population prior to bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradient (note that mature MKs express a high level of GPIIb and GPIb are designated as R3; R4 correspond to the isotype-matched controls).
