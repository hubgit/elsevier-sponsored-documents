        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>In metazoans, tissue growth relies on the availability of nutrients—stored internally or obtained from the environment—and the resulting activation of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> growth is mediated by seven <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (Dilps), acting through a canonical IIS pathway. During the larval period, animals feed and Dilps produced by the brain couple nutrient uptake with systemic growth. We show here that, during metamorphosis, when feeding stops, a specific DILP (Dilp6) is produced by the fat body and relays the growth signal. Expression of <italic>DILP6</italic> during pupal development is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Remarkably, <italic>DILP6</italic> expression is also induced upon starvation, and both its developmental and environmental expression require the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxO transcription factor. This study reveals a specific class of ILPs induced upon metabolic stress that promotes growth in conditions of nutritional deprivation or following developmentally induced cessation of feeding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Growth relies on the ability of cells and organisms to access nutrients. Nutrients can be obtained from diverse sources, such as from the environment through feeding, or from internal stores as with early embryos that develop from large eggs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">O'Farrell, 2004</xref>). Accordingly, because alternate sources of nutrients are used during specific periods of development, organisms must be able to adapt their metabolic and growth programs to changes in the developmental or environmental energy context.</p>
      <p>In complex animal species, growth is controlled by intermingled paracrine and endocrine regulatory processes, with organ and tissue growth governed by specific genetic programs that determine the target size and relative proportions of the species (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Day and Lawrence, 2000</xref>). The output of these genetic programs is further modified by environmental cues, including nutrition. Variations in nutritional input can influence growth and metabolism via insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Underwood et al., 1994</xref>). In particular, when nutrients are abundant, IIS is maximally active and growth is limited solely by the organ-intrinsic program; upon nutrient shortage, in contrast, IIS becomes limiting and restricts the growth and metabolic parameters accordingly.</p>
      <p>In mammals, the IIS system is split into two complementary and interacting subsystems that govern growth, metabolism, reproduction, and longevity (<xref rid="bib20 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nakae et al., 2001; Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>). The first of these corresponds to circulating insulin levels, which control carbohydrate and fat metabolism, and the second is the GH/IGF-I axis, which regulates cell and tissue growth. Starvation lowers circulating IGF-I, in part through decreased transcription of the <italic>IGF-I</italic> gene in the liver (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Thissen et al., 1994</xref>); this suggests that one major way in which starvation can affect growth is by reducing levels of circulating growth factors.</p>
      <p>The function of IIS in growth control is remarkably conserved in insects, and in particular in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where seven <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs) have been identified (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Géminard et al., 2006</xref>). The various <italic>DILP</italic> genes are expressed in different larval and adult tissues, suggesting that they carry nonredundant functions (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, <italic>DILP1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>-3</italic>, and <italic>-5</italic> are expressed in specialized neurosecretory cells located in each brain hemisphere, called the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Genetic ablation of these cells leads to severe larval growth deficits, hypertrehalosemia, and increased lifespan (<xref rid="bib13 bib26 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ikeya et al., 2002; Rulifson et al., 2002; Broughton et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>One major role for IIS in insects is to couple growth with the animal's energy status. Indeed, total nutrient deprivation downregulates <italic>DILP3</italic> and <italic>DILP5</italic> transcription in the IPCs, although <italic>DILP2</italic> expression remains unchanged (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>). Recent results indicate that variations in nutritional information are relayed by a nutrient sensor operating in the fat body, a larval organ that shares metabolic functions with the vertebrate white fat and liver. In particular, it has been shown that amino acid restriction triggers fat body-specific inhibition of the TOR complex1 (TORC1) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>), a major cell-based nutrient-sensing pathway (<xref rid="bib8 bib35 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dann and Thomas, 2006; Wullschleger et al., 2006; Guertin and Sabatini, 2007</xref>). Inhibition of TORC1 in the fat body systemically reduces larval growth in part by blocking Dilp secretion from the brain IPCs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, in line with the decreased levels of circulating IGF-I in vertebrates, starvation affects <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth by severely reducing brain-specific DILP function.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, previous work has shown that protein starvation causes the growth arrest of endoreplicative larval tissues (ERTs), while only slowing the growth and proliferation of cells in the larval brain and in imaginal discs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>). Similarly, generally reduced TOR signaling in the larva, which in many respects mimics the starvation state, strongly inhibits ERT growth, while generally sparing the imaginal tissues (ITs) that form the adult structures (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Oldham et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests a protection mechanism whereby, under adverse nutrition conditions, the fat body allows larval resources to be reallocated to high-priority tissues like the imaginal discs. Significantly, such a mechanism would require that some ILPs are produced during starvation and activate IIS in the tissues that continue to grow.</p>
      <p>Feeding arrest is also a programmed event during development. At the end of the larval period, animals undergo a stereotyped behavior called the wandering stage, when they migrate away from the food and prepare for pupariation. This developmentally induced starvation precedes the long pupal feeding arrest. During pupal development, larval tissues undergo intense remodeling. This process involves a major reallocation of resources, as future adult tissues form from ITs in a process that uses either nutrient stores that had accumulated in fat cells during larval life, or energy obtained from the degradation of obsolete larval tissues. Since organisms do not feed during this stage, no global growth or weight gain is observed; nevertheless, because tissue remodeling involves cell growth and proliferation, growth-promoting pathways presumably come into play (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). The paradox of pursuing a growth program in a nonfeeding organism that is subjected to catabolic regulation could be circumvented by the induction of growth-promoting hormones upon feeding arrest.</p>
      <p>We present here the characterization of a particular DILP, DILP6, which promotes growth during nonfeeding stages. The <italic>DILP6</italic> gene is expressed in fat body cells and is strongly induced during the wandering larval and pupal periods, as well as upon starvation. Reduced <italic>DILP6</italic> function results in a growth deficit during pupal development and an increased sensitivity to starvation in young adults. The sudden increase of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression at the onset of pupal development requires an endocrine signal that is provided by the steroid hormone ecdysone. In parallel, starvation increases <italic>DILP6</italic> expression through dFoxO-mediated feedback regulation of IIS. Therefore, DILP6 constitutes an IGF-like peptide with a specialized role in promoting growth during developmentally or environmentally induced nonfeeding states.</p>

        <title>IIS Promotes Pupal Growth</title>
        <p>Most studies concerning growth control in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have focused on the larval period. Within a time window of 4 days, the larval body weight increases 500-fold through the active conversion of nutrients into tissue mass. During this period, IIS plays a major role in coordinating nutrient intake and tissue growth: it promotes cell growth in postmitotic ERTs, cell growth coupled to proliferation in ITs, and the formation of substantial nutrient stores in fat cells. To investigate a possible role for IIS during the postfeeding developmental period, we used the <italic>Gal4/Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> temporal conditional expression system (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>) to knock down InR specifically during pupal development. When transgenic animals containing the relevant constructs were raised at a restrictive temperature following the larval/pupal transition, the normal inhibition of Gal4 by Gal80 was relieved and the InR gene was silenced by RNAi. This targeted reduction of InR function during the pupal stage using this system resulted in smaller and lighter adults, with reduced appendages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref> available online). This demonstrates that IIS-dependent growth occurs during the nonfeeding developmental period in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>DILP6 Is a Fat Body-Derived Growth Inducer</title>
        <p>To further investigate this phenomenon, we looked for specific <italic>DILP</italic> genes responsible for IIS activation in pupal tissues. Specifically, we used quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine the temporal expression patterns of the different <italic>DILP</italic> genes. This analysis revealed that, while the expression of most <italic>DILP</italic> genes decreases to basal levels at the end of the larval period, <italic>DILP1</italic>, <italic>-3</italic>, and <italic>-6</italic> are expressed at maximal levels during the pupal period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). We focused our attention on one of these genes in particular, <italic>DILP6</italic>, as its transcripts started accumulating at the wandering period, the late larval stage during which animals cease feeding and prepare for pupariation, and because it presented the highest rates of RNA accumulation during this period.</p>
        <p>We first characterized two <italic>DILP6</italic> deletion mutants that were generated by imprecise excision of a <italic>P</italic> element inserted into the 5′ region of the gene. Deletion #41 removes part of the 5′ region as well as exon 1 of the <italic>DILP6</italic> gene, and deletion #68 removes the entire <italic>DILP6</italic> gene, plus four additional annotated transcription units downstream of <italic>DILP6</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). No <italic>DILP6</italic> transcripts were detected in <italic>DILP6<sup>#68</sup></italic> mutant larvae, whereas qRT-PCR detected sequences corresponding to second and third exons in <italic>DILP6<sup>#41</sup></italic> larvae (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B). The two deletions produced indistinguishable phenotypes, with viable adults presenting a 8%–10% reduction in mass relative to sibling controls; this reduction could be fully rescued by targeted expression of the <italic>DILP6</italic> gene in the fat body (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The <italic>DILP6<sup>#41</sup></italic> deletion was thus considered to be a strong hypomorph or null mutation for <italic>DILP6</italic>, and was used for our phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis of <italic>DILP6</italic> transcripts by 5′-RACE for the <italic>DILP6<sup>#41</sup></italic> mutant revealed the existence of two transcripts containing the starting AUG of the <italic>DILP6</italic> ORF with additional 5′ ORFs that could reduce the translation efficiency of <italic>DILP6</italic> and explain the observed phenotype (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The growth defect observed with <italic>DILP6</italic> loss of function suggested that <italic>DILP6</italic> is not fully redundant with the other <italic>DILP</italic> genes, perhaps because of its specific function or timing of expression. Nevertheless, the levels of other <italic>DILP</italic> genes, especially <italic>DILP1</italic>, were elevated in <italic>DILP6</italic> mutant animals, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may exist that may reduce the severity of <italic>DILP6</italic> loss of function (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B). Interestingly, the growth defect observed in <italic>DILP6</italic> mutants is not accompanied by a developmental delay (data not shown), indicating that the growth impairment occurs after the animals have passed the “critical period,” and can no longer compensate for growth deficits by extending the duration of larval development (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mirth and Riddiford, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p><italic>DILP6</italic> is highly expressed in the fat body, a larval tissue that orchestrates the nutrient response and coordinates growth and metabolic functions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), and expressed at low levels in the gut and brain (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C). Specifically silencing <italic>DILP6</italic> in the fat body using the <italic>cg-GAL4</italic> (<italic>cg&gt;</italic>) driver and two distinct <italic>DILP6</italic> RNAi constructs produced systemic growth defects that were similar to what was observed in the deletion mutant, indicating that the most important site of <italic>DILP6</italic> production is in the fat body. The silencing of <italic>DILP6</italic> in other larval tissues had no effects on systemic growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B and data not shown). Conversely, overexpressing <italic>DILP6</italic> in fat body cells increased systemic growth, indicating that <italic>DILP6</italic> is a bona fide growth inducer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Surprisingly, the levels of circulating carbohydrates (trehalose and glucose) and triacylglycerides (TAGs) were not modified in <italic>DILP6</italic> mutant larvae at the wandering stage, suggesting that <italic>DILP6</italic> function, although limiting for growth control, is dispensable for metabolic regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>DILP6 Is Required for Growth during Nonfeeding Developmental Stages</title>
        <p>We next explored the requirement for <italic>DILP6</italic> function during development using the <italic>Gal4/Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> induction system. Specifically, <italic>DILP6</italic> function was temporally controlled using the ubiquitous <italic>actin-Gal4</italic> driver and the temperature-sensitive Gal4 inhibitor, <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, to express either a <italic>UAS-DILP6 RNAi</italic> or a <italic>UAS-DILP6</italic> construct at various times during development. We first observed that silencing <italic>DILP6</italic> before the wandering stage did not affect the final adult mass (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). By contrast, extending <italic>DILP6</italic> silencing up to pupariation reduced the adult mass, indicating that <italic>DILP6</italic> function starts being required at the wandering stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This requirement extends into pupal development, as selective silencing of <italic>DILP6</italic> during the pupal stage also led to a growth defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, increasing <italic>DILP6</italic> expression in wandering larvae and in pupae promoted growth, whereas it had no effect in early larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A–3C). Together, these results indicate that <italic>DILP6</italic> is required during late larval and pupal development, and that its function is not limiting during earlier larval stages. These results were consistent with the normal timing of expression of <italic>DILP6</italic> and established that this ILP promotes growth specifically during nonfeeding periods of development.</p>
        <p>In pupae, the supply of nutrients is limited to larval stores and cannot be renewed through feeding. The extent of growth during this period is determined both by the availability of nutrient stores and the level of circulating growth inducers. In order to assess the physiological significance of <italic>DILP6</italic>-mediated pupal growth control, we examined the effects of altering pupal growth by <italic>DILP6</italic> overexpression or silencing on the fitness of emerging adults. Large adults produced by increased <italic>DILP6</italic> expression in pupae presented reduced glycogen levels and were less resistant to starvation upon emergence. Conversely, small adults produced by lowered <italic>DILP6</italic> expression had increased glycogen and TAG levels and survived longer under starvation conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>D–3F). This indicates that, in the absence of nutrient uptake, DILP6 levels determine the balance between growth and resource storage, therefore indirectly influencing the metabolic state in the young adult.</p>

        <title>Ecdysone Controls the Developmental Expression of <italic>DILP6</italic></title>
        <p>The rapid increase in <italic>DILP6</italic> expression during the late larval stage, as well as its sustained expression during the pupal stage, coincides with the increase in ecdysone titers at the larval/pupal transition. Therefore, we checked whether the developmental expression of <italic>DILP6</italic> could be controlled by ecdysone. For this, we reduced the level of TOR signaling in the prothoracic gland (the site of ecdysone production), a condition known to delay the peak of ecdysone production by 24 hr (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Layalle et al., 2008</xref>). The effect on ecdysone production was confirmed by observing a 24 hr delay in the transcriptional induction of <italic>E74B</italic>, an early ecdysone-induced response gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Significantly, the profile of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression was delayed to the same extent, suggesting that the increase in <italic>DILP6</italic> levels that occurs at the end of larval development is controlled by the burst of ecdysone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). To further test our hypothesis, we specifically reduced the levels of ecdysone signaling in fat body cells by silencing the gene encoding the ecdysone receptor (EcR) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">King-Jones and Thummel, 2005</xref>). EcR silencing in the fat body reduced <italic>DILP6</italic> transcript accumulation at the larval wandering stage and in pupae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Finally, the addition of 20E to larval fat body explants cultured ex vivo was sufficient to induce <italic>DILP6</italic> transcription in fat cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Together, these results indicated that <italic>DILP6</italic> expression is driven by the ecdysone signal at the end of larval development, and that the main target tissue for this signal is the fat body.</p>

        <title><italic>DILP6</italic> Is Induced upon Nutrition Shortage</title>
        <p><italic>DILP6</italic> expression is strongly induced in wandering larvae and in pupae, two developmental stages during which animals do not feed. This observation prompted us to ask whether <italic>DILP6</italic> expression could also be induced upon starvation. Indeed, when early feeding larvae were transferred overnight to agarose plates containing only 1% sucrose and no amino acid source, the global level of <italic>DILP6</italic> mRNA was strongly increased. Detailed analysis of dissected tissues revealed that <italic>DILP6</italic> expression was specifically increased in fat cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Moreover, the comparison of global expression levels of several <italic>DILP</italic> genes reveals that <italic>DILP6</italic> is expressed at higher levels than <italic>DILP2</italic>, <italic>-3</italic>, and <italic>-5</italic> under starvation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). To assess the physiological relevance of this regulation, we next examined the effects of starvation on organismal growth in a <italic>DILP6</italic> mutant background. Larvae were transferred to 1% sucrose/agarose medium at 96 hr after egg deposition (AED), and the weight of emerging adults was measured. While control adults raised under these conditions weighed 25% less than fed controls, <italic>DILP6</italic> mutants weighed 33% (<italic>DILP6<sup>#68</sup></italic>) and 35% (<italic>DILP6<sup>#41</sup></italic>) less than fed mutant animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). This indicates that growth of <italic>DILP6</italic> mutants is compromised relative to control animals upon starvation, and therefore that the increase in <italic>DILP6</italic> expression observed upon starvation protects larvae from drastic impairments of organismal growth.</p>

        <p><italic>DILP6</italic> transcription is specifically activated in nonfeeding conditions, and can be either developmentally or environmentally induced. Because larval fat body cells also accumulate the dFoxO transcription factor in its active, nuclear form both at the wandering stage and under starvation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), we investigated the possibility that both the environmental and developmental induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression involve dFoxO activity. We first examined the induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression by starvation in a <italic>dFoxO</italic> mutant background, and found that it was abolished (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). These results were confirmed by knocking down <italic>dFoxO</italic> expression in the fat body, indicating that dFoxO function is autonomously required in fat cells for the induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Analysis of the upstream region of the <italic>DILP6</italic> gene revealed the presence of several dFoxO binding sites, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using dFoxO-specific antibodies yielded a genomic fragment of the <italic>DILP6</italic> gene containing these sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). We conclude from these experiments that <italic>DILP6</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of dFoxO, and that dFoxO is required for increased <italic>DILP6</italic> expression upon starvation in fat body cells.</p>
        <p>We then tested whether the developmental induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> also requires dFoxO function. For this, we observed the developmental profile of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression in larvae deprived of dFoxO. The rise in <italic>DILP6</italic> expression observed at the larval/pupal transition was delayed in <italic>dFoxO</italic>-null mutant larvae, but <italic>DILP6</italic> transcripts eventually reached intermediate levels, suggesting that, while dFoxO is required for the timely developmental expression of <italic>DILP6</italic>, other factors also contribute to its activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). To specifically test the requirement for dFoxO in the induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> by 20E, we added 20E to fat bodies dissected from control or <italic>cg &gt; dFoxO RNAi</italic> larvae, and measured <italic>DILP6</italic> levels by qRT-PCR. We observed that 20E was still able to induce <italic>DILP6</italic> expression in the absence of dFoxO, albeit at lower levels than in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). These ex vivo results confirmed our in vivo expression data, and indicate that dFoxO is required for normal <italic>DILP6</italic> expression induced either developmentally or by starvation. They also revealed that additional effectors other than dFoxO contribute to the induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> by 20E.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>During the successive stages of development, organisms use alternate sources of nutrients to support tissue growth and morphogenesis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, embryonic tissues develop using maternal stores accumulated in the egg in the form of yolk. Larval development follows, with a major growth program relying on the animals' capacity to obtain nutrients from the environment. Finally, during the pupal stage, animals do not feed, and a large quantity of nutrients stored in fat cells allows pupae to prolong growth and finalize the development of adult structures. On top of these basic developmental strategies, feeding larvae have evolved additional buffering mechanisms to protect growing tissues from sudden variations in environmental energy supplies. Notably, brain ILPs promote larval growth and allow the coupling of growth to nutritional input. Their expression and secretion from brain IPCs decrease upon starvation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>), and several brain DILPs show only residual expression in the pupa (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, there must be a distinct set of growth inducers that take the lead to activate growth in the pupa and upon nutritional stress. We show here that, in both of these contexts, a physiological switch takes place that triggers the activation of <italic>DILP6</italic>, a member of a distinct class of ILPs devoted to growth during nonfeeding periods.</p>
      <p>The <italic>DILP1</italic> and <italic>DILP3</italic> genes are also expressed during pupal development, suggesting that they may act in concert with <italic>DILP6</italic>. Individual knockout of either of these two <italic>DILP</italic> genes only produces marginal growth defects (S.G. and L.P., unpublished data), suggesting that there is a high level of redundancy between them or with <italic>DILP6</italic>. Our observation that <italic>DILP1</italic> expression increases two-fold in <italic>DILP6</italic> mutant larvae suggests a possible compensatory mechanism that could partially suppress the growth impairment observed in <italic>DILP6</italic> mutants. The functional class of ILPs represented by DILP6 may be conserved in other insect species, as an ecdysone-induced, fat-body-specific ILP has recently been described in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The developmental and environmental induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> involves overlapping mechanisms. First, in response to nutrient deprivation, the IIS component, dFoxO, provokes a burst of <italic>DILP6</italic> transcription, thereby linking <italic>DILP6</italic> expression with the nutritional status of the animal. This represents a feedback regulation on IIS, as dFoxO, an inhibitor in the IIS pathway, induces the expression of <italic>DILP6,</italic> an activator of IIS. Interestingly, expression of <italic>DILP3</italic> in the adult was also recently shown to depend on <italic>dFoxO</italic> function (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Broughton et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that other <italic>DILP</italic> genes in this subclass are subjected to similar controls.</p>
      <p>DILP6 does not appear to be effective as a paracrine/autocrine factor for fat cells. Indeed, fat cells of starved larvae, which express high levels of <italic>DILP6</italic>, undergo extensive autophagic transformation, even though autophagy has been shown to be blocked in these cells by IIS activation (<xref rid="bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rusten et al., 2004; Scott et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, overexpression of <italic>DILP6</italic> in the fat body of starved larvae does not prevent autophagy (M.S. and P.L., not shown).</p>
      <p>More generally, ERTs present stronger growth inhibition in response to starvation than do ITs. The role of a starvation-specific ILP that is induced upon nutritional stress could be to reroute energy stores toward high-priority organs and tissues, such as those responsible for the formation of the future adult. The specific action of DILP6 on imaginal cells could contribute to this diversified behavior, although this would require that ITs are more receptive to the DILP6 signal than are ERTs, at least upon starvation. Such differences in the response of ERTs and ITs to the DILP signal, combined with the production of specific DILPs upon starvation, could constitute a bona fide mechanism for the specific allocation of spare resources to ITs under nutritional stress. However, the mechanisms for such a biased response need to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>At the end of larval development, animals stop feeding and prepare for pupal development. We show here that tissue remodeling in the pupa involves IIS-dependent growth, and that <italic>DILP6</italic> is specifically expressed and required for growth during this period. The transition from larval to pupal development is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone (20E), and we also show that 20E is required for proper <italic>DILP6</italic> induction at the larval/pupal transition. In view of the absence of obvious EcR/Usp binding sites in the 5′ region of the <italic>DILP6</italic> gene, as well as our previous demonstration that EcR signaling controls dFoxO nuclear localization (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that dFoxO could mediate the ecdysone-dependent expression of <italic>DILP6</italic>. However, both genetics and ex vivo experiments on dissected fat bodies indicate that, although dFoxO appears to contribute to the developmental induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> at the larval/pupal transition, it is not required for the 20E-induced expression of <italic>DILP6</italic>. In an accompanying manuscript, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al. (2009)</xref> report that 20E-induced expression of <italic>DILP6</italic> is not affected by cycloheximide, suggesting that the transcriptional induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> by EcR/Usp is direct.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that ecdysone has a growth-inhibitory function during larval development (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, increased basal levels of circulating ecdysone in larvae can reduce the growth rate and, conversely, decreased basal ecdysone levels can increase the growth rate. Although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet fully understood, we have established that the levels of ecdysone produced experimentally in these experiments remain close to basal levels, and are insufficient to modify <italic>DILP6</italic> expression (M.S., R.D., and P.L., unpublished data). Therefore, while basal levels of ecdysone can inhibit systemic growth through an unknown mechanism, high ecdysone levels at the larval/pupal transition can induce <italic>DILP6</italic>, and thus systemically activate IIS.</p>
      <p>One puzzling observation reported here is that the modification of <italic>DILP6</italic> expression in pupae can alter the adult mass as well as the resistance of animals to starvation at eclosion. How can <italic>DILP6</italic> overexpression in pupae increase adult mass if the mass of the pupa is fixed at the end of larval life? One possible explanation is that DILP6 participates in a tradeoff between the construction of adult tissues and the maintenance of energy stores in the pupa. Indeed, the levels of both TAG and glycogen stores in the young adult are affected by DILP6 levels in the pupa. In this line, recent reports indicate that, under optimal conditions, not all nutrients are used by the pupa, and part of the energy is conserved to provide sustenance during the early period of adult life that precedes feeding. Some larval fat body cells are still present in early adults, and provide energy until feeding begins. Suppressing the death of these cells increases the energy stores and enhances the resistance of young adults to starvation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguila et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>DILP6</italic> knockdown in pupae has a similar effect: less energy is used by the pupa to build tissues, meaning that the adult ecloses with a smaller body, but with greater energy stores to help overcome early nutritional stress. <italic>DILP6</italic> overexpression has the opposite effect. Our results therefore indicate that DILP6 sets the energy balance in pupae by promoting tissue growth, while sparing an energy pool that can be used by the young adult.</p>
      <p>DILP6 shares some specific features with vertebrate IGF-I that distinguish both of them from insulin. DILP6 peptide sequence does not present obvious cleavage sites for an internal C peptide (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>). It is produced in the fat body, a tissue sharing common functions with the vertebrate liver, where IGF-I is mainly produced. <italic>DILP6</italic> mutant animals present growth defects without obvious metabolic changes, suggesting that DILP6 might have an exclusive growth function. Finally, the induction of growth factor production under conditions of energy stress is also relevant to cancer biology. Indeed, IGF-I and IGF-II are frequently expressed within neoplastic tissue. It is suspected that they act as autocrine and paracrine growth factors within tumors, allowing tumor cells to evade nutritional shortage and acquire survival properties (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Pollak, 2008</xref>). The induction of <italic>DILP6</italic> under starvation and its preferential targeting to ITs instead of ERTs could represent an interesting parallel to the induction of IGFs in tumor cells, where the selective action of growth factors can promote growth and survival of specific tissues in a nonfavorable environment.</p>

        <p>(A) At pupal stage, organismal growth requires insulin signaling. Temperature shift-up experiment (18°C–29°C) was carried out at the onset of the pupal stage (i.e., from 120 hr after egg deposition [AED] until adult eclosion) with <italic>tubGal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <italic>act &gt; dInR RNAi</italic>. <italic>tubGal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <italic>act &gt; w</italic> under the same temperature-shift program and <italic>tubGal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <italic>act &gt; dInR RNAi</italic> grown at restrictive temperature (18°C, normalized to <italic>W</italic>) were used as controls. Graph shows adult mass of animals in which <italic>InR</italic> was silenced during pupal stage compared to controls. Means ± SD are presented (n ≥ 50; <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>(B) Expression of <italic>DILP</italic> genes during development. For each profile, fold changes are calculated relative to the minimal level. No cross-quantification is provided between the different DILP genes. Error bars represent SD.</p>

        <p>DILP6 Activates Growth from Postfeeding Larval Development until Adult Emergence</p>
        <p>(A–C) Changes in <italic>DILP6</italic> expression affect animal growth during late larval and pupal stages, but not during early larval development. <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, <italic>act &gt; DILP6</italic> or <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, <italic>act &gt;, DILP6-RNAi</italic> flies were kept at restrictive temperature (29°C) until 96 hr AED in order to silence or overexpress <italic>DILP6</italic> during early larval development. A shift-down to permissive temperature (18°C) at 96 hr AED has no effect on adult mass (A). When the temperature shift occurs at the larval-pupal transition (120 hr AED), changing <italic>DILP6</italic> expression induces significant effects on animal mass (B). Temperature shift-up from 120 hr AED until adult emergence affects animal mass (C). Adult mass is compared to <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <italic>act &gt; w</italic> as control exposed to identical temperature-shift programs. Graph represents means ± SD (n ≥ 100; <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>(D) Measurement of starvation resistance of newly emerged flies where <italic>DILP6</italic> was overexpressed or silenced from 120 hr AED until adult emergence. Starvation was performed at 18°C to inhibit Gal4 activity (error bars represent SD; n ≥ 84).</p>
