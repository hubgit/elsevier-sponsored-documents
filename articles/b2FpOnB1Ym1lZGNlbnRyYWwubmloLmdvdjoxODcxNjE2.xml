        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Nuclear transfer to eggs or oocytes provides a potential route for cell-replacement therapies <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> because oocytes directly reprogram transplanted mammalian somatic-cell nuclei such that they have an embryo-like pattern of gene expression. This includes a large increase in the mRNA level of the stem-cell marker gene <italic>oct4</italic><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We have developed a novel procedure to identify new proteins that greatly increase the level of <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA upon nuclear transfer. We have isolated <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte proteins that bind to the regulatory region of the mouse <italic>oct4</italic> gene and identified these by mass spectrometry. The proteins include the retinoic-acid-receptor γ, a known repressor of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription, and Tpt1, a cancer-associated factor <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The depletion of transcripts of <italic>retinoic-acid receptor γ</italic> from oocytes increases <italic>oct4</italic> and <italic>nanog</italic> transcription as expected, and depletion of <italic>tpt1</italic> transcripts in oocytes reduces <italic>oct4</italic> and <italic>nanog</italic> transcription in injected HeLa nuclei. An elevation of <italic>tpt1</italic> transcripts in oocytes results in an earlier activation of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription. Therefore, we identify a novel role for <italic>tpt1</italic> in activating pluripotency genes upon nuclear transfer. Our results help to elucidate the mechanism by which somatic-cell nuclei are reprogrammed to have an embryo-like pattern of gene expression.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>Apart from global chromatin decondensation <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[4–7]</xref>, the mechanisms and molecules involved in nuclear reprogramming and in establishing pluripotency are not well understood. <italic>oct4</italic> is a gene that is normally expressed only in pluripotent, embryo-like cells. It is not expressed in somatic cells but is activated upon nuclear transfer into oocytes and in embryonic stem (ES) cells <xref rid="bib2 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[2, 8]</xref>. When development and differentiation proceed <xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[9–12]</xref>, or when retinoic acid is present <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <italic>oct4</italic> transcription is downregulated. Pluripotency proteins such as Oct4 and Nanog are transcription factors with essential roles in permitting the proliferation of ES cells <xref rid="bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[14–16]</xref>. Even though several proteins, such as GCNF <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, SF1 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, LRH1 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, retinoic acid <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and Sall4 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, are already known to regulate the <italic>oct4</italic> promoter region in cultured cells or in later development, it is still unknown what is responsible for the activation of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription, which correlates with cloning efficiency <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21, 22]</xref>. <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes provide abundant material and contain proteins that cause a large increase in the level of <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA. The identification of such proteins is important for a better understanding of generating pluripotency and of the molecular events by which eggs or oocytes reprogram somatic-cell nuclei.</p>
      <p>To identify proteins that bind to the <italic>oct4</italic> regulatory region, we have used radioactively labeled DNA oligos corresponding to regions of the mouse <italic>oct4</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). These oligos were incubated in oocyte extract and DNA-protein complexes analyzed on gels. Many of the oocyte-derived proteins showed sequence specificity for the oligos representing the <italic>oct4</italic> regulatory region, as shown by the addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Competition experiments with CpG methylated versus unmethylated oligos revealed that the proteins prefer to bind to the unmethylated oligos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). To identify which proteins bind to the different oligos, we recovered the proteins from gels and identified them by mass spectrometry. We have identified proteins already known to have a function in nuclear reprogramming and have thereby validated our procedure. These proteins include nucleoplasmin <xref rid="bib4 bib7 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[4, 7, 23]</xref> and the histone-binding protein N1/N2 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We identified FRGY2, which is involved in disassembling somatic nucleoli in egg cytoplasm; this disassembly process accompanies nuclear reprogramming <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The retinoic-acid receptor γ was also identified. Retinoic acid induces retinoic-acid receptors in cultured cells, and an increase in both retinoic acid and its receptors causes differentiation of pluripotent cells <xref rid="bib13 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[13, 18]</xref>. A retinoic-acid receptor has already been shown to bind to the <italic>oct4</italic> regulatory region <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Most intriguingly, we have identified Tpt1 by using mass spectrometry with oligo Sf1 (data not shown); Tpt1 has not so far been implicated in regulating <italic>oct4</italic> transcription.</p>
      <p>Tpt1 stands for tumor translationally controlled protein 1. It is widely expressed and conserved throughout vertebrates, and was first identified in a screen for genes involved in tumor reversion. <italic>tpt1</italic> is the gene that shows the strongest differential expression between tumor and tumor-reversed states in human leukemia and breast-cancer cells <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>tpt1</italic> is strongly expressed in tumor cells and is downregulated upon tumor reversal. Moreover, when Tpt1 is inhibited in tumor cells, suppression of the malignant phenotype is observed <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>oct4</italic> is expressed in tumor cells <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and we recovered Tpt1 with our oligos. Hence, we decided to focus on Tpt1.</p>
      <p>We tested whether Tpt1 binding to the Sf1 oligo could be confirmed. We repeated the gel shift, but this time in the presence of a Tpt1 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). This resulted in a supershift, indicating that Tpt1 in fact binds to the Sf1 oligo and is not an artifact of the mass-spectrometry results. In addition, Tpt1 was also found to bind in vivo, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis with <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
      <p>To determine the developmental function of Tpt1, we carried out a test that depends on the downregulation of the <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA. We wanted to find out whether <italic>oct4</italic> activation is inhibited in reduced abundance of <italic>tpt1</italic>. Antisense DNA oligos (ODN, oligo deoxynucleotides) that successfully degrade endogenous <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA in living oocytes were designed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2D). Antisense oligos were also prepared for the identified retinoic-acid receptor γ (RAR), which serves as a control because of its known function in downregulating <italic>oct4</italic> transcription <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2E). After downregulation of both <italic>tpt1</italic> and <italic>RAR</italic> mRNAs, the levels of other oocyte mRNAs were unchanged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). As a control, antisense oligos against <italic>gfp</italic> did not cause downregulation of any other genes tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C–2F). This suggests that the antisense oligos against <italic>RAR</italic> and <italic>tpt1</italic> act specifically. Moreover, antisense oligos against <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> mRNA resulted in specific downregulation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Tpt1 protein but not of mouse Tpt1 protein, which is not targeted by these antisense oligos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G).</p>
      <p>To reinforce our evidence for the importance of <italic>tpt1</italic> for <italic>oct4</italic> activation, we have asked whether <italic>tpt1</italic> is required for an increase in <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA in nuclear-transfer experiments. Forty hours after oocyte injection of antisense oligos, approximately 100 HeLa nuclei were injected into the germinal vesicles of oocytes, which were cultured for up to 24 hr. We took different time points and analyzed them by RT-PCR in order to observe the activation of <italic>oct4</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Because our method is very sensitive, we found that <italic>oct4</italic> and <italic>nanog</italic> were expressed in nonpluripotent cells, such as human HeLa cells, but at a very low background level. However, if a large number (several thousand) of nonpluripotent HeLa cells was analyzed, the signal was strong and was used as a positive control for the RT-PCR. The time course revealed a gradual increase of <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). In control samples that were only injected with HeLa nuclei and not antisense oligos, we observed a 100-fold increase in <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA within several hours of nuclear transfer (Yen-Hsi Kuo, personal communication). We find that oocytes depleted of <italic>RAR</italic> mRNA activate human <italic>oct4</italic> transcription earlier and more strongly than do oocytes with a normal endogenous level of <italic>RAR</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). This increased level of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription due to <italic>RAR</italic> mRNA downregulation agrees with previous findings that RAR is an inhibitor of pluripotency and induces differentiation <xref rid="bib13 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[13, 18]</xref> and thus validates our functional test. When antisense oligos against <italic>tpt1</italic> were injected into oocytes, the opposite result was obtained. We found that a reduction in the oocyte content of <italic>tpt1</italic> greatly reduced <italic>oct4</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). This suggests that <italic>tpt1</italic> is involved in <italic>oct4</italic> transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>To test the specificity of our antisense oligo against <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA, we have rescued <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> depletion by injecting mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA into oocytes previously injected with antisense oligos against <italic>tpt1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Importantly, mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA does not contain the sequence that is targeted by the <italic>Xenopus</italic> antisense oligos. Hence, mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA was not degraded and rescued the depletion of <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> mRNA and, subsequently, <italic>oct4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). This result confirms that the downregulation of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA is specific.</p>
      <p>To determine more precisely how the level of <italic>tpt1</italic> influences <italic>oct4</italic> transcription, we injected different concentrations of mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA into oocyte cytoplasm. An incubation period of 16 hr allowed for the mRNA to be translated, and HeLa nuclei were then injected into the oocyte germinal vesicle. After 8 hr of incubation, the <italic>oct4</italic> signal was already enhanced in comparison to control oocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). As a result, mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA injected into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was effective at enhancing <italic>oct4</italic> transcription. These observations were independent of the mRNA concentrations used (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Hence, in our nuclear-transfer experiments, <italic>tpt1</italic> overexpression enhanced <italic>oct4</italic>. This suggests that Tpt1 might have an important role in regulating <italic>oct4</italic>; namely, it might ensure a level required for pluripotency and normal development.</p>
      <p>We were interested in whether Tpt1 is a transcription factor specific for <italic>oct4</italic> or whether it is a more generally important component that might act on other pluripotency genes. Using the same up- and down-regulation procedure just described for <italic>oct4</italic>, we have tested the transcriptional activation of the human pluripotency gene <italic>nanog</italic> by using nuclear transfer to oocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G) <xref rid="bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[27, 28]</xref>. <italic>nanog</italic> seems to be an important pluripotency gene because its overexpression increases the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming by 200-fold in cell-fusion experiments <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Overall, we found that a reduction in the <italic>RAR</italic> did not significantly affect <italic>nanog</italic> expression. However, we had expected some effect on <italic>nanog</italic> expression because retinoic acid is known to downregulate pluripotency genes <xref rid="bib13 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[13, 18]</xref>. One explanation for our finding is that Nanog or Nanog orthologs do not exist in amphibians (NCBI blast). As a result, some aspects of transcriptional activation upon nuclear transfer might not be conserved between mammals and amphibians. However, we saw a reduction in <italic>nanog</italic> transcription after downregulation of <italic>tpt1</italic> in oocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G). To test for binding of Tpt1 to <italic>nanog</italic>, we carried out ChiP analysis in mouse ES cells and found that Tpt1 bound to <italic>oct4</italic>, but not significantly to the immediate promoter of <italic>nanog</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This suggests that Tpt1 regulates <italic>oct4</italic> by binding to its DNA directly, whereas Tpt1 might regulate <italic>nanog</italic> in an indirect way or by binding to a distant site.</p>
      <p>Overall, Tpt1 seems to represent a global regulator of pluripotency. We suggest that Tpt1 might have a somewhat general role in establishing an embryonic pattern of gene expression because it controls transcription of <italic>oct4</italic> and <italic>nanog</italic>. In support of this view, we have also found that the transfection of <italic>tpt1</italic> antisense RNA into mouse ES cells can reduce the transcription from the <italic>oct4</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4C), suggesting a conserved mechanism between mammals and amphibians.</p>
      <p>The molecular events occurring after nuclear transfer and the initiation of pluripotency are not well understood. We describe here the first protein that has been discovered to be required for activating transcription of pluriptoency genes such as <italic>oct4</italic> and <italic>nanog</italic> after nuclear transfer into oocytes. In the future, this type of work might provide a generally applicable experimental design, which in combination with the advantages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, might lead to the identification of other proteins that activate pluripotency genes and thereby further elucidate mechanisms involved in nuclear reprogramming.</p>

        <p>(A) Diagram of the 2.3 kb regulatory region of the mouse <italic>oct4</italic> gene (not to scale) <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The region contains a distal enhancer (DE), a proximal enhancer (PE), and a promoter (P). Translation is initiated at nucleotide +1. Four methyl-sensitive restriction sites are shown (M). Double-stranded DNA oligo fragments were designed to represent fragments of the <italic>oct4</italic> regulatory region, as aligned below the diagram.</p>
        <p>(B) <italic>oct4</italic> promoter fragments (oligos) and their corresponding DNA sequences.</p>
        <p>(C) Specificity of protein binding to oligos was determined by competition experiments, as shown here for the −166 oligo. Oocyte extract was added to P<sup>32</sup>-labeled oligos in the presence of an increasing amount (12.5–50 μM) of competitor. The addition of the same but unlabeled oligo resulted in a stronger decrease of the gel-shift signal than the addition of an unspecific oligo of the same length that is not represented in the <italic>oct4</italic> upstream region. This illustrates specificity for protein-oligo complex formation, which was found in all oligos.</p>
        <p>(D) <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte proteins are competed out less efficiently with methylated oligos compared to the same oligos that are unmethylated. Competition with increasing concentrations (12.5–50 μM) of unlabeled oligos (unmethylated or methylated) revealed a protein binding preference for unmethylated oligos (only shown for the −166 oligo). The following abbreviation is used: methylated (Met).</p>

        <p>Tpt1 Binds to <italic>oct4</italic> DNA, and Its mRNA Can Be Downregulated in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Oocytes</p>
        <p>(A) The Tpt1 protein binds to the Sf1 oligo. An antibody bound to the Tpt1-Sf1 protein-oligo complex resulted in a supershift, confirming that Tpt1 binds the Sf1 oligo. As a control, the −166 oligo, which did not bind Tpt1 according to the mass spectrometry results, was used, and the antibody did not shift the extract-oligo complex under these conditions.</p>
        <p>(B) To confirm Tpt1 binding to the mouse <italic>oct4</italic> promoter in vivo, we injected oocytes with HA-tagged <italic>tpt1</italic>-HA mRNA and an <italic>oct4</italic> promoter-containing plasmid, pOct4. A ChIP analysis was performed with an HA antibody and verified Tpt1 binding to the <italic>oct4</italic> promoter. An H3 antibody was used as a positive control, and the absence of antibodies served as a negative control. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM). The following abbreviation is used: antibody (Ab).</p>
        <p>(C) Short antisense oligo deoxynucleotides (ODNs) were designed to target <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> mRNA-encoding proteins identified by mass spectrometry (only Tpt1, RAR, and GFP control shown). Primers used for monitoring mRNA downregulation are indicated, together with the primers used for detecting the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> housekeeping gene <italic>ornithine decarboxylase</italic> (ODC). The following abbreviations are used: forward (F), reverse (R).</p>
        <p>(D) We injected 5 or 10 ng of different ODN oligos (Tpt1 ODN1–4) into oocytes to establish which ODNs are the most successful in downregulating <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA. As a negative control, an ODN was used <italic>against gfp</italic> (ODN GFP). After 24 hr, the level of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA was established. Injection of 10 ng Tpt1 ODN3 resulted in the most significant decrease of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA, down to 9% in comparison to the <italic>tpt1</italic>-mRNA level of uninjected oocytes (100%). Error bars indicate the SEM.</p>
        <p>(E) We injected 10 ng of different ODNs (anti-RAR ODN1–3) and the negative ODN GFP into oocytes to establish which ODNs downregulate <italic>RAR</italic> mRNA most successfully. After 24 hr, the level of <italic>RAR</italic> mRNA was most downregulated by RAR ODN3, down to 12% in comparison to the <italic>RAR</italic> mRNA level in control oocytes (100%). Error bars indicate the SEM.</p>
        <p>(F) ODNs against <italic>tpt1</italic>, <italic>RAR</italic>, and <italic>gfp</italic> do not significantly alter the transcriptional level of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> housekeeping gene <italic>ornithine decarboxylase</italic>, suggesting specificity for mRNA downregulation. Error bars indicate the SEM.</p>
        <p>(G) Antisense oligo against <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> mRNA results in downregulation of endogenous oocyte Tpt1 protein and mouse-<italic>tpt1</italic> (M<italic>tpt1</italic>)-mRNA injection in Tpt1 overexpression. Extracts from uninjected oocytes (track 1), oocytes injected with HA-tagged <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> mRNA (XTpt1-HA, track 2), HA-tagged mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA (MTpt1-HA, track 3), and antisense oligos against <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic> (tracks 4 and 5) were run on a protein gel in the presence of X<italic>tpt1</italic>-HA (track 4) and M<italic>tpt1</italic>-HA mRNA (track 5). Tpt1 was detected with an HA antibody. Mouse and <italic>Xenopus tpt1</italic>-HA-mRNA-injected oocytes resulted in an increase of Tpt1 protein (tracks 2 and 3) in comparison to the control oocytes (track 1). XTpt1-HA was successfully depleted by antisense oligos against <italic>tpt1</italic> (track 4), but MTpt1-HA was not (track 5). This illustrates that the endogenous Tpt1 protein can be successfully downregulated with antisense oligos but that M<italic>tpt1</italic>-HA cannot.</p>

        <p>(A) Assay identifying proteins that regulate <italic>oct4</italic> transcription. Antisense ODN oligos injected into living oocytes result in degradation of their target mRNAs. This is associated with a decrease in the level of the corresponding protein. If this protein is involved in regulating <italic>oct4</italic> transcription, HeLa nuclei injected into the living oocytes should show a decrease in the <italic>oct4</italic> expression level.</p>
        <p>(B) Tpt1 binds to the <italic>oct4</italic> gene in mouse ES cells, as confirmed by ChIP analysis. Mouse ES cells were transfected with a plasmid containing HA-tagged mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> or HA-tagged <italic>smad2</italic> (negative control). A cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter ensured expression of the mRNA in the ES cells. Antibodies against H3 (positive control) or HA were used for determining whether Tpt1-HA binds to the mouse Oct4 or Nanog promoter regions. <italic>oct4</italic> was enriched when Tpt1-HA was overexpressed and the HA antibody was used, in comparison to when Tpt1 was not overexpressed or when no or a different antibody was used. In contrast, the <italic>nanog</italic> signal was not significantly increased, suggesting very weak or no binding of Tpt1 to the <italic>nanog</italic> promoter region.</p>
        <p>(C) We injected human HeLa nuclei into oocytes and aimed for their germinal vesicles. Human <italic>oct4</italic> reactivation was monitored over time by RT-PCR. An increase of <italic>oct4</italic> transcripts was observed with time. When the <italic>RAR</italic> was downregulated with antisense oligos and HeLa nuclei were injected into the living oocytes, the increase in <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA level resulted in accelerated transcriptional activation in comparison to the control. The level of human <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA was already higher at 8 hr than the mRNA level detected in control oocytes after 24 hr.</p>
        <p>(D) <italic>tpt1</italic> depletion inhibited the increase of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription after nuclear transfer. <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA was depleted with antisense oligos. As a result, the <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA level did not increase over time as observed in the control samples. The <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA level was much reduced in oocytes depleted of <italic>tpt1</italic>, showing that <italic>tpt1</italic> is required for activation of the pluripotency gene <italic>oct4</italic>.</p>
        <p>(E) To show that <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA downregulation is specific, we carried out a rescue experiment. Twenty nanograms of mouse <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA could restore and increase human <italic>oct4</italic> expression in HeLa nuclei transplated into oocytes that have been depleted of their endogenous (<italic>Xenopus</italic>) <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA.</p>
        <p>(F) Overexpression of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA resulted in accelerated activation of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription. We injected 10 ng and 20 ng of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA into oocytes before injecting HeLa nuclei. After 8 hr, a significant level of <italic>oct4</italic> transcripts was detected, and such a level was not reached even after 24 hr in control oocytes.</p>
        <p>(G) Tpt1 is required for <italic>nanog</italic> activation. Upon transfer of HeLa nuclei, <italic>nanog</italic> is activated, and its level increases with time. Depletion of <italic>tpt1</italic> resulted in the lack of <italic>nanog</italic> activation, as also observed with <italic>oct4</italic>. <italic>RAR</italic> depletion did not seem to have a significant effect on <italic>nanog</italic>, in contrast to oct4. Error bars indicate the SEM.</p>

        <p>Knockdown of <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA in Mouse ES Cells Is Associated with a Decrease in the Transcriptional Activity of the <italic>oct4</italic> Promoter</p>
        <p>(A) Illustration of a functional assay for Tpt1 in ES cells. Mouse ES cells containing an additional integrated <italic>oct4</italic> promoter driving an <italic>egfp</italic> reporter were transfected with siRNA against <italic>tpt1</italic>. Upregulation of <italic>egfp</italic> mRNA indicates that the targeted mRNA is required for <italic>oct4</italic> repression. Conversely, <italic>egfp</italic>-mRNA downregulation shows that the mRNA is responsible for <italic>oct4</italic> activation or maintenance.</p>
        <p>(B) DNA primers and siRNA target sequences for knockdown are shown. DNA primers were designed to detect reduction of the mRNA of choice. The mouse housekeeping gene <italic>β-2-microglobulin</italic> was used as a control and reference. siRNAs were designed to target specifically <italic>gfp</italic>, <italic>β-galactosidase</italic>, and <italic>tpt1</italic>. siRNA against <italic>tpt1</italic> mRNA resulted in decrease down to 17% of its endogenous level (not shown).</p>
        <p>(C) FACS analysis of the siRNA experiments shows that Tpt1 siRNA causes a decrease in <italic>oct4</italic> transcription in mouse ES cells. Mouse ES cells were transfected with siRNAs against <italic>β-galactosidase</italic>, <italic>gfp</italic>, and <italic>tpt1</italic>, and the GFP level was monitored by FACS analysis after 48 hr, as expected. siRNA targeting β-galactosidase, which is usually not present in mouse ES cells, did not reduce the GFP level (negative control). siRNA against <italic>gfp</italic> resulted in a decrease of GFP, showing that siRNA can downregulate a message and that this can be detected by FACS analysis. siRNA targeting <italic>tpt1</italic> gave rise to a decrease in the GFP level, indicating that <italic>tpt1</italic> is also an activator of <italic>oct4</italic> transcription in mouse ES cells. The corresponding downregulation of the endogenous <italic>oct4</italic> mRNA itself was also confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). No differentiation was seen, because the siRNA transfection was transient. The effect of the decrease was restored within 3 days, which is not long enough for ES cells to be differentiated. Finally, we found that the RNAi knockdown experiment was very variable, and different batches of ES cells produced different results.</p>
