        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria utilize polysaccharide surface layers called capsules to evade the immune system; consequently, the synthesis and export of the capsule are a potential therapeutic target. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-30, the integral membrane tyrosine autokinase Wzc and the cognate phosphatase Wzb have been shown to be key for both synthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides. In the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, the CpsCD complex is analogous to Wzc and the phosphatase CpsB is the corresponding cognate phosphatase. The phosphatases are known to dephosphorylate their corresponding autokinases, yet despite their functional equivalence, they share no sequence homology. We present the structure of Wzb in complex with phosphate and high-resolution structures of apo-CpsB and a phosphate-complexed CpsB. We show that both proteins are active toward Wzc and thereby demonstrate that CpsB is not specific for CpsCD. CpsB is a novel enzyme and represents the first solved structure of a tyrosine phosphatase from a Gram-positive bacterium. Wzb and CpsB have completely different structures, suggesting that they must operate by very different mechanisms. Although the mechanism of Wzb can be inferred from previous studies, CpsB appears to have a tyrosine phosphatase mechanism not observed before. We propose a chemical mechanism for CpsB based on site-directed mutagenesis and structural data.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bacterial capsules (capsular polysaccharides or CPSs) play critical roles in interactions between bacteria and their environments. They are often the point of first contact with the host and represent important virulence factors for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. CPSs are frequently associated with protection of bacteria against the host immune system.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Several distinct processes for CPS synthesis and assembly have been described. One of these, known as the Wzy-dependent pathway, is found in many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> In the Wzy-dependent process, lipid-linked intermediates carrying individual repeat-units of the CPS are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane, where they form substrates for the polymerization step, which requires the characteristic oligosaccharide polymerase Wzy. Full polymerization activity requires the involvement of a member of the polysaccharide co-polymerase family; examples include Wzc in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and CpsCD in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Wzc and CpsCD are also members of the tyrosine autokinase family (BY kinases).<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,4</sup></xref> Wzc is an integral membrane protein consisting of two transmembrane helices flanking a periplasmic domain and a cytosolic C-terminal region containing the tyrosine kinase and an extended tyrosine-rich tail (reviewed by Cuthbertson <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Mutation of the Walker box motif in Wzc abolishes both phosphorylation and capsule assembly. The <italic>wzb</italic> gene has been shown to be essential for CPS expression,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and the extent of phosphorylation influences the amount of CPS produced.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Wzb is a member of the cysteine-dependent tyrosine phosphatase superfamily and, given its location in the genome, is assumed to target Wzc. Thus, at least for <italic>E. coli</italic> K-30, the cycling of phosphorylation appears to be crucial to the proper functioning of the Wzc-dependent system. In the Gram-positive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the protein complex CpsCD is thought to mimic Wzc, but it utilizes separate polypeptides for the transmembrane/periplasmic kinase (CpsC) and the cytoplasmic kinase (CpsD) domains.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> The phosphorylation state of CpsCD also influences both the amount of CPS formed<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7–9</sup></xref> and the extent of CPS attachment to the cell wall.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> While there is evidence that phosphorylation is not universally required for CPS assembly, it is likely to play an important role in a number of diverse but clinically important bacterial systems.</p>
      <p>The structure of the cytosolic tyrosine autokinase domain from a close homolog of Wzc (called Etk) has been reported recently.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Furthermore, the structure of the functional kinase domain of the CpsCD homolog CapAB from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has been determined.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The structures reveal close similarities to the Mrp–MinD subfamily of P-loop ATPases.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Dephosphorylation of the tyrosine cluster at the C-terminus of the CpsAB kinase leads to oligomerization of the kinase domain into octamers, but it is not yet known what effect this has on the full-length protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The precise mechanism by which phosphorylation influences biosynthesis of CPS remains to be defined, and it is unclear how the information contained in the C-terminal tyrosine cluster is structurally translated into a regulation of the whole assembly system. Its involvement may not be confined to a single step since both the kinase and the phosphatase could modify other proteins participating in sugar nucleotide precursor biosynthesis<xref rid="bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14–16</sup></xref> or initiating glycosyltransferases.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Following biosynthesis, the assembly processes diverge in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria because the latter must export the CPS across the periplasm and outer membrane. This process also involves the polysaccharide co-polymerase protein Wzc, whose periplasmic domain interacts with a novel outer membrane protein, Wza,<xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19</sup></xref> belonging to the OPX (outer membrane polysaccharide export) family.<xref rid="bib2 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,20</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Despite the functional parallels, the Gram-negative and Gram-positive phosphatases, such as Wzb and CpsB, are completely unrelated at the sequence level. Wzb is a homolog of low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine phosphatases, which occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and these enzymes characteristically function via a conserved cysteine residue that serves as nucleophile.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Our understanding of this enzyme family is supported by biochemical and structural studies on the eukaryotic family members<xref rid="bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21–23</sup></xref> and, for prokaryotic representatives, by the NMR structure of uncomplexed Wzb.<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> In contrast, CpsB and related phosphatases belong to the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) family,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and biochemical studies indicated that CpsB phosphatases are metal-dependent enzymes.<xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27–29</sup></xref> No structural information for prokaryotic CpsB-like phosphatases is available to date. Since the dephosphorylation of bacterial tyrosine kinases, such as Wzc and CpsCD, is a crucial part in the capsular assembly process in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, the phosphatases represent potential targets for drug development efforts. We have thus characterized representatives from each family: Wzb from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-30 (denoted Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>) and CpsB from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 (denoted Cps4B).</p>
      <p>We present here a 2.5-Å resolution structure of a Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> product complex, a 2.2-Å structure of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> in complex with sulfate, the 1.9-Å apo-structure of Cps4B and the 2.2-Å Cps4B phosphate product complex. Comparison of the structures, coupled to site-directed mutagenesis, yields important mechanistic insights into these enzymes. Furthermore, we show that both Wzb and Cps4B are capable of completely dephosphorylating full-length Wzc, establishing that Cps4B activity is not confined to its cognate CpsCD complex.</p>

        <title>Structure of the Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> product complex</title>
        <p>We solved two structures of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>—one in complex with the phosphate reaction product (2.5 Å resolution) and another in complex with sulfate, a mimic of the reaction product (2.2 Å resolution). The two structures superimpose with an rmsd of 0.3 Å, and although the phosphate-complexed structure is partially disordered, the active site is well defined and the positions of the two ligands are identical.</p>
        <p>In terms of tertiary structure, Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> is essentially identical with the NMR structure of apo-Wzb<sub>K-12</sub>, with an rmsd of 0.8 Å for 132 superposable C<sup>α</sup> atoms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Briefly, the enzyme has a mixed αβ structure with a central four-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices. The active-site cavity is marked by the reactive Cys13 residue, which sits on top of the β-sheet. The Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> structure is a product complex, containing a phosphate ion that is coordinated by residues Arg19 (N, N1, N2), Gly15 (N), Asn16 (N), Ile17 (N), Cys18 (N) and Asp119 (O2). The phosphate is positioned such that the phosphorus oxygen bond is in line with the S atom of Cys13 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b), correctly oriented for S<sub>N</sub>2 attack. Previous biochemical data have established that a Cys13Ser mutation eliminates phosphatase activity,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and the structure confirms that Cys13 is indeed the catalytic nucleophile. NMR-based phosphate titrations have shown that the binding of phosphate to the active site leads to structural rearrangements.<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> A superposition of the ligand-free NMR structure of Wzb<sub>K-12</sub> onto our Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> complex structure shows that phosphate binding leads to an ordering not only of the residues that are directly bound to the phosphate but also of the nucleophilic Cys13 and Tyr117, which are adjacent to phosphate ligands and believed to be important for substrate binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1).</xref><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Cps4B is a novel phosphatase with three active-site metals</title>
        <p>We solved the structure of Cps4B in two crystal forms, <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> and <italic>P</italic>4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2. Both structures are identical with the exception of loop 169–177, which shows a significant conformational change between the two crystal forms, indicating a degree of flexibility in this part of the structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). The loop is involved in crystal contacts in both structures, but it would protrude into the surrounding solvent if the protein was in solution.</p>
        <p>The structure reveals that Cps4B is a member of the PHP-fold family<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and consists of two three-stranded parallel β-sheets with a ring of α-helices on the outside of the structure. Three metal ions are bound adjacent to one another between the β-sheets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The fold can be described as a distorted TIM barrel.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The SSM algorithm<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> was applied to search the protein structure database for similar structures, and the proteins identified with the most similarity were two phosphotriesterases from <italic>E. coli</italic> [PHP, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1BF6]<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (SsoPox, PDB ID 2VC5).<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> These structures are representatives of the PHP fold; the structural similarity is relatively low, with rmsd values larger than 2.6 Å and <italic>Z</italic>-scores lower than 5.0 for both structures (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref>). Chemically, there is a link between the reactions catalyzed between Cps4B and phosphotriesterases, such as PHP and SsoPox, in that these enzymes both hydrolyze phosphate ester bonds, although the phosphates are attached to very different organic groups. Furthermore, phosphotriesterases use only two metal ions and have different residues (including a carboxylated lysine) involved in chelating the metal ions.<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31–33</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Cps4B co-purifies with three metal ions bound to the active site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). Metal M1 is coordinated in a trigonal-bipyramidal fashion by two axial ligands (Glu80 and Asp199) and three equatorial ligands, His5, His7 and W1. Since water molecule W1 also serves as a ligand for metal M2, it is most likely deprotonated and thus represents a shared hydroxyl ion. M2 is coordinated by Glu80, Glu108, His136 and two water molecules, W1 and W2, in a slightly distorted square-based pyramidal ligand shell. Glu80 serves as a bidentate ligand for metals M1 and M2. The distance between M1 and M2 is 3.5 Å, which is typical for a binuclear metal centre.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Metal M3 has distances of 4.7 and 5.6 Å to metals M1 and M2, respectively, and has a tetragonal ligand sphere composed of His42, Asp14, His201 and water molecule W3.</p>
        <p>The anomalous peak for M3 is significantly smaller than peaks corresponding to M1 and M2, indicating that a different metal is bound to this site (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3</xref>). Although the purified enzyme is loaded with metal ions, it is a relatively poor catalyst with artificial substrate <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). As previously described for homologs of Cps4B,<xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27–29</sup></xref> we found that the addition of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions to the reaction increases the activity of Cps4B by more than 10-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> lead to a much lower activation of the enzyme, and since these are most abundant in expression media and purification buffers, the low initial enzyme activity is potentially due to incorrect metal ion loading.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>The Cps4B–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> complex</title>
        <p>To compare the mechanisms of Cps4B- and Wzb-like enzymes, we solved the structures of Cps4B in complex with a phosphate ion. The apo- and phosphate-bound structures of Cps4B are almost identical, with an rmsd of 0.14 Å. The phosphate is tightly bound to the active site by a multitude of interactions involving all three metal ions and amino acid residues Arg139 and Arg206. Interestingly, the phosphate replaces all three metal-bound solvent molecules (W1, W2 and W3; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3a</xref> <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">and 4</xref>). Also, due to their interaction with the ligand, both Arg139 and Arg206 (which are partly disordered in the apo-structure) are much better defined in terms of electron density.</p>
        <p>To identify residues that might play a role in substrate binding and catalysis, we mapped an alignment<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> of Cps4B homologs onto the Cps4B structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). This procedure reveals that both phosphate ligands Arg139 and Arg206 are conserved and therefore most likely important for Cps4B-mediated catalysis. In order to test this hypothesis, we prepared Cps4B mutants Arg139Ala and Arg206Ala (R139A, R206A) and checked both for catalytic activity. Whereas Cps4B<sub>R206A</sub> shows approximately 40% remaining activity, Cps4B<sub>R139A</sub> has only 5% of wild-type activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). Some of the active-site metal ligands (e.g., His5, His7, His42 and His201; Cps4B numbering) and residues interacting with metal ligands (Asp3; Cps4B numbering) have been mutated in other studies, and the corresponding mutants showed 1%–20% residual activity.<xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27–29</sup></xref> Our structure shows that these residues are clearly important for the stability of the metal cluster and thus for the function of the enzyme. Nevertheless, their role in catalysis is indirect (see below), and we therefore identify Arg139 as the catalytic key player of Cps4B.</p>
        <p>Additionally, our structure reveals that some of the activity-affecting residues that were mutated by LaPointe <italic>et al</italic>. (down to ∼ 5% of wild-type activity<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>) (D64N, R68A, R69A, C78S; numbering of LaPointe <italic>et al</italic>.) are situated on the molecular surface or distant from the active site of Cps4B and thus most likely not involved in catalysis. However, it should be noted that the corresponding experiments were performed at elevated temperatures (47 or 75 °C) and that the observed loss in activity might be due to a destabilizing effect of the mutations under those conditions.</p>

        <title>Catalytic mechanism of Cps4B</title>
        <p>The mode of binding of phosphate in the active site of Cps4B suggests a possible mechanism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Many metal-dependent phosphatases employ a metal-bound water molecule or hydroxyl ion as nucleophile.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> The phosphate ion bound to the active site of Cps4B replaces all three metal-bound water molecules W1, W2 and W3. Our structural data give no evidence for another residue, or group, that could act as nucleophile. The Cps4B–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> structure most likely resembles a post-reaction state where the phosphate group has been transferred from tyrosine to the nucleophilic water molecule. Considering steric restraints (the leaving group is a large protein) and the fact that most phosphoryl-transfer reactions proceed via an in-line nucleophilic attack,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> only W1 remains a plausible candidate as the nucleophile of Cps4B. Notably, the shared hydroxyl W1 is also proposed to be the nucleophile in the structurally related phosphotriesterases.<xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref> Phosphotriesterases break down otherwise toxic organophosphorus triesters by nucleophilic attack of a metal-activated hydroxyl at the phosphorus atoms.<xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref> We propose that in Cps4B, the incoming phosphotyrosine binds to the active site via Arg139, Arg206, M2 and M3. The strong ionic interaction of the phosphate group with Arg139 helps position the phosphorus atom directly over the nucleophile, W1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and additionally displaces negative charge from the phosphorus atom, making it more amenable for the subsequent in-line nucleophilic attack by W1. During the S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement, the positively charged elements surrounding the active site (Arg139, Arg206, M1, M2 and M3) will help stabilize the developing negative charge of the trigonal-bipyramidal intermediate. Additionally, after cleavage of the phosphoester bond, this positive potential should stabilize the resulting tyrosinate by lowering the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the phenolic OH group. The tyrosinate would finally be protonated by solvent as it leaves the active site. A similar stabilization of a tyrosinate by a positive charge has been described for SDR dehydrogenases.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> In broad outline, the chemistry is similar to that of the phosphotriesterases.<xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Comparison of the active sites of Cps4B and Wzb</title>
        <p>The catalytic mechanism of cysteine-dependent low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine phosphatases, such as Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>, is well established.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Briefly, the phosphotyrosine substrate is bound by a conserved positively charged arginine residue (Arg19 in Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>) and a ring of backbone amides that present a positively charged pocket. The reaction would proceed in two distinct steps—S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement of tyrosine by the thiol (Cys13 in Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) that is followed by protonation of the tyrosinate through either Asp119 or a second conserved cysteine (Cys18; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b).<xref rid="bib21 bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,39,40</sup></xref> This creates an enzyme-bound thiophosphate ester intermediate and free tyrosine. In the second step, the thiophosphate ester is hydrolyzed by an incoming water molecule (activated by Asp119) in another S<sub>N</sub>2 displacement, this time generating free phosphate and regenerating the thiol.</p>
        <p>Although the structures of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> and Cps4B are completely different and evolutionary unrelated, the fact that both act on the same substrate prompted us to look for common chemical features in the active sites of both enzymes. We superimposed our product complexes of Wzb and Cps4B by matching three of the phospho-oxygen atoms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Since the phosphate ion in the Wzb structure presents a pre-reaction state and the phosphate ion in the Cps4B structure presents a post-reaction state, we superposed the phosphate of Wzb onto the Cps4B phosphate such that it mimics the substrate state (before the nucleophilic hydroxyl attacks and inverts the geometry). This “product-based alignment” reveals that metal ions M2 and M3 serve in part as a structural counterpart of the ring of backbone amides (a positive charge) that position the phosphate group in Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref> <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">and 7</xref>). The C3 symmetry of the phosphate group along the reaction axis allows three ways of superposing the two phosphate groups. For one of the three possible choices, we found a good structural alignment of the catalytically important arginine residues Arg19 of Wzb and Arg139 of Cps4B (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The nucleophilic Cys13 of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> superposes with the shared hydroxyl, W1, which is bound between M1 and M2 of Cps4B. This observation supports our assumption that W1 provides the nucleophile in the Cps4B-catalyzed dephosphorylation reaction. As Cps4B does not create an enzyme-bound intermediate, it does not need a chemical counterpart for the conserved Asp119 of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>.<xref rid="bib21 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,40</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Substrate binding and specificity</title>
        <p>In Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>, a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr117 of Wzb<sub>K-30</sub>) is believed to be important for binding of the phosphotyrosine at the active site.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Modeling a phosphotyrosine onto the bound phosphate in our Wzb-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> complex structure corroborates this proposal since the modeled tyrosine forms a stacking interaction with Tyr117 (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5</xref>). The substrate-based alignment (see above and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) reveals that Cps4B does not possess an obvious counterpart for this tyrosine.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, loop βF/α6 shows a significant conformational change between the two crystal forms <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> and <italic>P</italic>4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). It is close to the active site and contains several hydrophobic amino acids that could potentially form hydrophobic interactions with the incoming substrate (e.g., Leu172, Phe173 and Tyr177). The loop is not well conserved over its full length (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>), but many Cps4B homologs contain a FG(D/E)K/R motif in this position, where the phenylalanine corresponds to Phe173 of Cps4B (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). Although this loop could be important in binding the phosphotyrosine, it does not confer any specificity of Cps4B to CpsCD, since our results show that Cps4B readily dephosphorylates Wzc from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-30 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Bacterial tyrosine kinases, such as Wzc<sub>K-30</sub>, are involved in a plethora of processes ranging from production of CPS to regulation of virulence functions.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The function of these proteins is crucially dependent on phosphatases, which are homologs of either Cps4B in Gram-positive bacteria or Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> in Gram-negative bacteria. Due to the extent of the important processes that are regulated by these enzymes, they are of potential interest for drug development efforts. In this context, the solved structures may provide an important starting point for the development of new antibacterial drugs.</p>

        <p>Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> (with N-terminal His tag, crystal form I) crystallized in space group <italic>P</italic>3<sub>2</sub>21 as previously described.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> The structure was solved at 2.5-Å resolution by molecular replacement with the program PHASER<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> and using the NMR structure of apo-Wzb (51% sequence identity; PDB ID <ext-link xlink:href="pdb:2FEK" ext-link-type="uri">2FEK</ext-link>) from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> as search model. Initial <italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> − <italic>F</italic><sub>c</sub> electron density maps showed strong evidence for a phosphate ion bound to the active site, but refinement stalled (<italic>R</italic>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> of 30%/35%). Since twinning could be ruled out, we reintegrated the data and excluded any region that was affected by ice rings (MOSFLM).<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> To exclude model bias introduced by the NMR structure as much as possible, we improved the initial phases from the molecular replacement step by density modification procedures implemented in PHENIX.AUTOBUILD<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and used the same program to build a completely new structure. Refinement of this structure with PHENIX.REFINE<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> led to significantly improved <italic>R</italic>-factors of 22.0%/26.8% and good stereochemistry of the protein model.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>
        <p>After removal of the His tag (see above), Wzb<sub>K-30</sub> crystallized in space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> (crystal form II) under a different condition: 0.1 M Tris–Cl, pH 8.5, 1.2 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.01 M NiCl<sub>2</sub>. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> using the previously refined model of the <italic>P</italic>3<sub>2</sub>21 crystal form as search model. Initially, the data set was indexed and processed (HKL2000<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref>) in <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>.

The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In all structures, C13 (the active-site residue) adopts a disfavored Ramachandran conformation but appears well ordered. For the lower-resolution structure, two additional residues (K65 and S-1), both of which are disordered, are also in disfavored regions.</p>
        <p>Cps4B from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 was crystallized in space group <italic>P</italic>4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 as previously described.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> The structure was solved by single-wavelength (Cu-K, 1.54 Å) anomalous dispersion using a single samarium derivative crystal. A three-step protocol was used to prepare the heavy-atom derivative. In the first step, the crystal was soaked (10 min) in mother liquor supplemented with 50 mM samarium acetate. This step was followed by a quick back soak in mother liquor with 10% glycerol and a final soaking step with 20% glycerol. The derivative crystal was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to collection of a high-redundancy data set for structure solution (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>PHENIX.AUTOSOLVE<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> was used to locate the single Sm site in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, allowing the phases to be calculated. The resulting experimental maps at 2.7-Å resolution were of excellent quality and yielded a complete model for Cps4B. Subsequent refinement of the structure with PHENIX.REFINE<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> resulted in <italic>R</italic>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> factors of 17%/23%.
