      <abstract>
        <p>In this article, we specifically focus on the identification and management of patient beliefs and expectations during consultations with health-care professionals (HCPs). In examination of the nature and purpose of communication during consultations, we evaluate the research relating to doctor–patient communication, present the Calgary–Cambridge framework and highlight the identification and management of the patient's beliefs and expectations as a key part of this process. Having identified what can go wrong, we identify the characteristics of effective consultations and consider strategies for improving communication. In recommending a clear and more focussed approach to the identification and management of patient beliefs and expectations, we consider not only the nature of the therapeutic climate, but also the style and content that could enhance the effectiveness of the communication. Having identified techniques for facilitating self-disclosure, we conclude by offering suggestions on how to ‘close down’ the consultation and hand over responsibility to the patient.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Patient beliefs and expectations, as potential influences on adherence, precursors of behaviour change and mediators of outcome, are at the heart of the consultation process. Their identification and management can be understood and addressed only within the overall context of the consultation itself. According to Gask and Usherwood <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, there are three major features of the consultation: (1) the style with which a doctor listens to a patient will influence what they say; (2) effective communication between doctor and patient leads to improved outcome for many common diseases; and (3) patients' compliance will be improved if the management plan has been negotiated jointly. To optimise the effectiveness of the consultation therefore, it is necessary to clarify the nature and purpose of the consultation.</p>
    <sec id="sec2">
      <title>The nature of the consultation</title>
      <p>The communication process has been widely researched in the context of medical teaching and training and the most detailed and all-encompassing framework is provided in the Calgary–Cambridge Guides <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref> in which 71 specific elements (skills) are nested within a broader framework of process skills, outlined in <xref rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>.</p>
      <p>The key principles behind the approach are a blending of the biomedical (disease) perspective with the patient (illness perspective) within the context of background medical, personal and social history. Core evidence-based skills are identified for each facet of the consultation so that accurate information can be elicited in an efficient manner within a supportive patient-centred approach designed to facilitate patient engagement, thereby enhancing satisfaction and improving clinical outcomes. This is broadly consistent with the three core functions of the consultation: build a relationship, collect data and agree on a management plan <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Research into doctor–patient communication has established a number of key tasks of the consultation, including eliciting patients' problems and concerns, giving information, discussing treatment options and being supportive <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The key skills needed to perform these tasks have also been identified (see <xref rid="tbox2" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Unfortunately doctors often fail in these tasks. They fail to obtain sufficient information about patients' perceptions or impact of the problem <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, they do not check how well the patient has understood <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and have a tendency to block disclosure of emotional cues <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3">
      <title>What goes wrong in consultations?</title>
      <p>Are beliefs addressed? Are they linked with patient engagement? In a study of patient-centred competencies amongst general practitioner (GP) trainees in relation to explanation and planning, Campion et al. found that even with focussed training, exploring patients' beliefs about the illness was not seen in 14% of the candidates and only 39% met the performance criteria in three or more of five consultations; using beliefs in explanation was not seen in 31% of the candidates with only 17% of the candidates meeting the criterion in three or more of the five consultations; checking patients' understanding of explanations was not seen in 45% of the candidates with only 9% meeting the criterion in three or more of the five consultations, and involving patients in decisions was not seen in 14% of the candidates with only 36% meeting the criterion in three or more of the five consultations <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Patient dissatisfaction has been found to be associated with insufficient time spent dealing with the emotional component of consultations <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="sec3.1">
        <title>Failure to clarify the reason for the consultation</title>
        <p>The reasons for consultation are not always clear but failure to address them may lead to iatrogenic confusion and distress. Thus, even a patient with ‘uncomplicated’ back pain may be seeking cure or symptom relief, seeking diagnostic clarification, seeking reassurance, seeking ‘legitimisation’ of symptoms (for a variety of reasons) or even just wishing to express distress, frustration or anger. It is therefore important to identify the patient's beliefs and clarify his/her expectations of the consultation at the outset.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec3.2">
        <title>Failure to understand and address pain from a biopsychosocial perspective</title>
        <p>Many HCPs hold a very narrow biomedical or biomechanical view of the nature of musculoskeletal problems. The diagnostic labels they seek and the opinions they offer are couched in language much more suited to acute injury or ongoing disease than to describe pain persistence, pain-associated limitations or the psychological impact of pain. Often, they have a much clearer understanding of peripheral than central pain mechanisms. Disregard of the role of central pain-processing mechanisms leads to failure to integrate the contribution of cognitive factors, pain memories and the emotional impact of pain into the explanation given to the patient of their pain experience. For example, while some patients may be able to accept descriptions such as “just wear or tear”, for others it may reinforce latent beliefs about the vulnerability of their spine, help to develop fears of doing themselves further damage and kick-start the development of patterns of fear and avoidance. In offering a credible self-help approach to the patient, it is necessary to move from a ‘disease model’ to a ‘biopsychosocial model’ <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This is as important in patients with established disease as in patients with nonspecific diagnoses.</p>

      <title>Strategies for improving communication</title>
      <p>Laerum et al. conducted a combined quantitative and qualitative study of low back pain patients' interaction with and perception of consultations and identified five key features of the ‘good back-consultation’ <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These are presented in rank order according to the frequency, emphasis and stated importance by patients in <xref rid="tbox3" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>.</p>
      <p>Within this general framework, a number of specific strategies may be helpful.</p>
      <sec id="sec4.1">
        <title>Begin with clarification of the patient's objectives for the consultation</title>
        <p>It is sensible to begin every clinical encounter with a determination of the patient's beliefs/expectations. Patients consult for a variety of reasons; of which four are particularly common: to obtain cure or symptomatic relief; to seek diagnostic clarification; to seek reassurance and/or to seek “legitimisation of their symptoms.” Often, patients will have a clear and explicit reason(s) for consultation, but sometimes they just seem to wish to express distress, frustration or anger. It is tempting, particularly in secondary/tertiary care, to assume that knowledge of the diagnosis is sufficient to determine reasons for consultation.</p>
        <p>The HCP may have a differing set of expectations such as in the need for specialist investigations, on the appropriateness of certain requests for treatment or in the issue of sickness certification, but if there is a mismatch or ‘desynchrony’ and a degree of ‘negotiation’ is needed, management of the patient's expectations will be a critical part of this process, as will be the identification of mistaken or unhelpful beliefs, which may impede recovery. To enable and encourage the patient to express his/her expectations and concerns, the HCP has to establish a therapeutic climate encouraging self-disclosure, adopt an appropriate communication style using appropriate language and attend both to the verbal and non-verbal aspects of communication.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec4.2">
        <title>Establish the therapeutic climate</title>
        <p>Many encounters with primary care personnel are straightforward, focussed and not particularly emotionally loaded, but chronic and recurrent pain are frequently accompanied by ‘emotional baggage’ and the level of distress can have a markedly inhibiting effect on self-disclosure and thus compromise a clear assessment. Many people find it difficult to disclose their feelings to others. In the assessment of chronic pain patients, it is essential to facilitate this process. While it may not be essential for patients to actually like their HCP, it is important that they respect and trust them. Appropriate confirmation or clarification of the particular professional role may facilitate this process.</p>

        <sec id="sec4.3.1">
          <title>Non-verbal aspects of communication</title>
          <p>Many patients are apprehensive about consulting HCPs. Patients can be encouraged or discouraged in their presentation of symptoms simply by the professional's general demeanour. The power of ‘social signalling’ is perhaps most easily recognised amongst young people attempting to develop an intimate relationship. Establishment of eye contact and signalling interest by expression, orientation and reducing interpersonal distance are only some of the cues or signals learned in the socialisation process.</p>
          <p>In doctor–patient communication, the importance of establishing eye contact, signalling attention and willingness to listen are particularly important. Patients who are apprehensive about the encounter may become particularly aware of apparent ‘mismatch’ between cues (where, for example, the professional states interest, but communicates the opposite in terms of body language). Satisfactory meshing of verbal and non-verbal signals, and keeping the discussion flowing (with appropriate reassurance or encouragement) is important in the facilitation of communication.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec4.3.2">
          <title>Adopt patient-friendly terminology</title>
          <p>Offer a clear explanation, avoid unnecessary diagnostic detail and use of labels implying progressive disease. However, in setting the low back pain in context (e.g., with reference to the age-related changes), be careful not to imply that the low back pain is therefore unimportant.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec4.3.3">
          <title>Facilitate self-disclosure</title>
          <p>Although emotional disclosure can temporarily heighten distress, many individuals report a lessening of distress after disclosure. The disclosure of emotionally upsetting information has also been shown to have a positive impact on indices of immune function, health status and health-care use <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="sec5.1">
        <title>Provision of simple explanation and realistic prognosis</title>
        <p>Ensure that the ‘reframing’ of pain is understood and accepted by the patient and they leave the consultation with a clear plan of action and strategies for dealing with (inevitable) flare-ups and recurrences. Main et al. give an explanation detailing symptoms in a plausible manner <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

        <title>Motivating, facilitating and encouraging self-help</title>
        <p>A key strategy in preventing the patient developing an unnecessary level of disability is to ‘reposition’ the patient at the centre of the ‘rehabilitative’ process rather than as a passive recipient of treatment. This requires the patient to share responsibility for the management of their back pain and, in some respects, the HCP to function as much as a coach as a therapist.<boxed-text id="N0x10650430N0x11885d20"><title>Key points</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>•</label><p>Patient beliefs and expectations have an important influence on consulting, response to treatment and clinical outcome, but are frequently not specifically addressed during consultations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>Establishing a therapeutic climate and facilitating self-disclosure underpin successful identification of patients' beliefs and expectations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>Addressing specific concerns, and clarifying mistaken beliefs at the outset will facilitate the development of an agreed plan of action.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>All patients should be provided with a credible but simple explanation of the difference between acute and chronic pain, the importance of central pain mechanisms and the development of disability.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>This explanation must be provided using language and terminology that patients understand, to ensure that it shapes their beliefs and expectations and optimises their pain coping strategies.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="N0x10650430N0x11886380"><title>Research priorities</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>•</label><p>Develop a simple agreed descriptive system for the identification and management of beliefs and expectations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>Investigate the influence of a more systematic and targeted approach to communication, on patient satisfaction, on adoption of increased patient responsibility and on improved outcomes as evidenced by helpful behavioural changes.</p></list-item><list-item><label>•</label><p>To improve outcomes, we need to clarify the nature of our interventions, their objectives and the skill-sets which need to be developed to deliver these in clinical practice.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The consultation is the starting point of most clinical interventions. Beliefs and expectations (of both patient and HCP) are at the heart of this process and serve as a platform for developing an agreed plan of action. The nature of consultation has been investigated particularly in the teaching of doctor–patient communication skills to medical undergraduates. As part of such initiatives, much has been learned about the nature of communication itself and has led to the clarification of key components of therapeutic encounters, as described in the Calgary–Cambridge framework.</p>
      <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the burgeoning literature on the nature and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions has failed to recognise the importance of such perspectives, whether in terms of therapeutic competency or of appraisal of treatment fidelity (e.g., ensuring that beliefs and expectations have been systematically and effectively targeted). In crystallising the essential features of communication, we have endeavoured to assist the development of a clearer and more systematic approach to the identification and management of patient beliefs and expectations as part of clinical management.</p>
