        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Cardiac myofibroblasts are pivotal to adaptive remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI). These normally quiescent cells invade and proliferate as a wound healing response, facilitated by activation of matrix metalloproteinases, particularly MMP-2. Following MI these reparative events occur under chronically hypoxic conditions yet the mechanisms by which hypoxia might modulate MMP-2 activation and cardiac myofibroblast invasion have not been investigated. Human cardiac myofibroblasts cultured in collagen-supplemented medium were exposed to normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>) or hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) for up to 48 h. Secreted levels of total and active MMP-2 were quantified using gelatin zymography, TIMP-2 and membrane-associated MT1-MMP were quantified with ELISA, whole cell MT1-MMP by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry and MT1-MMP mRNA with real-time RT-PCR. Cellular invasion was assessed in modified Boyden chambers and migration by scratch wound assay.</p>
        <p>In the human cardiac myofibroblast, MT1-MMP was central to MMP-2 activation and activated MMP-2 necessary for invasion, confirmed by gene silencing. MMP-2 activation was substantially attenuated by hypoxia (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), paralleled by inhibition of myofibroblast invasion (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, migration was independent of either MT1-MMP or MMP-2. Reduced membrane expression of MT1-MMP (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) was responsible for the hypoxic reduction of MMP-2 activation, with no change in either total MMP-2 or TIMP-2. In conclusion, hypoxia reduces MMP-2 activation and subsequent invasion of human cardiac myofibroblasts by reducing membrane expression of MT1-MMP and may delay healing after MI. Regulation of these MMPs remains an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fibroblasts account for up to two-thirds of the total cell number in the normal human heart <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and maintain the integrity of myocardial structure through controlled proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. Adverse remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI) is characterised by myocyte death, hypertrophy of surviving myocytes, proliferation, migration and invasion of cardiac myofibroblasts and fibrosis <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[3–5]</xref>. An important part of this process is the transformation of normally quiescent cardiac fibroblasts into the proliferative and invasive myofibroblast phenotype that can alter the structure of the cardiac interstitium through increased expression and activation of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>. Gelatinase activation is a prerequisite for both proliferation and invasion <italic>in vivo</italic> and is required to promote myocardial infarct healing and adaptive remodelling. However, in the long-term this can lead to adverse myocardial remodelling characterised by impaired contractile function and fibrosis.</p>
      <p>Unlike MMP-9, which is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, MMP-2 is constitutively expressed by cardiac myofibroblasts and secreted in a latent form (proMMP-2). Activation of proMMP-2 takes place at the cell membrane and requires the participation of both membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) in cancer cells <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MT1-MMP is itself expressed in a latent form and processed intracellularly to its active species by furin, a proprotein convertase that cleaves precursor proteins to their biologically active state <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Generation of active MT1-MMP and its transfer to the cell membrane is a critical step in MMP-2 activation <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and, together with TIMP-2, facilitates membrane binding of proMMP-2 to MT1-MMP. Although the main role of TIMP-2 is that of physiological inhibition of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP by post-translational regulation <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, it is also essential for cell membrane binding of proMMP-2. This binding in turn promotes activation of proMMP-2 which facilitates ECM degradation <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Acute coronary events such as MI lead to profound myocardial injury and are inevitably associated with periods of inadequate oxygen supply (hypoxia) to the myocardium. Hypoxia itself is a major cue for tissue remodelling in the cardiovascular system, in part via MMP activation <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. Indeed, distinct responses in different cell types in a variety of species have been shown to be induced as a result of hypoxic insult. Typically, hypoxia has been reported to increase cellular activation of MMP-2 as demonstrated in monkey endothelial cells <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, rat cardiac fibroblasts <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Interestingly however, although chronic hypoxia increased MMP-2 secretion in human endothelial cells, a decrease in its activation was observed <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Similarly, an inhibitory effect of chronic hypoxia on MMP-2 activation has been documented in human endometrial stromal cells <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref> and proximal tubular cells <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is clear therefore, that hypoxia-induced effects on MMP-2 activation are both species and cell-type specific and, importantly, the underlying mechanisms are not consistent. Since any changes to the regulation of matrix deposition and degradation in the myocardium have the potential to create deleterious effects on myocardial function, the present study was designed to investigate specifically the influence of chronic hypoxia on collagen-induced MMP-2 activation and invasion of human cardiac myofibroblasts.</p>

        <p>Biopsies of human atrial appendage were obtained from patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Ethical committee approval and informed patient consent were obtained and the investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Primary cultures of atrial cardiac myofibroblasts were harvested and cultured in full growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin) essentially as we have described previously <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Cells were characterised as myofibroblasts by co-expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. Experiments were performed on early passage cells (2–5) from different patients.</p>

        <p>Cardiac myofibroblasts (3 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were plated in full growth medium and incubated overnight. Medium was then exchanged for serum free medium (SFM) for 48 h. Serum-starved cells were transferred to fresh medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS and 50 μg/ml Type I collagen (Calbiochem) and transferred to humidified incubators at 37 °C for 24–48 h in normoxia (5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air) or hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 94% N<sub>2</sub>). Type I collagen culture conditions were used to represent the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment of cardiac myofibroblasts. Samples of conditioned media (CM) were collected for zymography and/or immunoassay (ELISA).</p>

        <p>Gelatin zymography and subsequent densitometric analysis were performed on myofibroblast CM as we have described previously <xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>. Optimised loading volumes were determined by serial dilution of CM to ensure that band intensity was proportional to MMP-2 zymographic activity. CM from HT-1080 cells (a human fibrosarcoma cell line that constitutively secretes MMP-2) <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> was included on each gel as a positive control.</p>

For fluorescence immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using a previously described protocol <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For immunoblotting, non-reduced cell lysates were prepared by scraping into extraction buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% Brij-35), sonicating 6 × 10 s (4 °C) and centrifugation for 15 min (8000 ×<italic>g</italic>, 4 °C) to pellet cellular debris. Lysates were subsequently electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membrane and visualised using MT1-MMP antibody (ab38971; AbCam, Cambridge, UK) and enhanced chemiluminescence.</p>

        <title>Type I collagen induces MMP-2 activation that is attenuated by chronic hypoxia</title>
        <p>Myofibroblasts cultured in the presence of Type I soluble collagen under normoxic conditions showed significant activation of MMP-2 compared with cells cultured in the absence of collagen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), as evidenced by the appearance of a lower molecular weight zymogen band (62 kDa) in addition to the 72 kDa proprotein. There were no differences in secreted levels of total MMP-2 between cells cultured in the absence or presence of collagen (data not shown). After exposure to chronic hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>, 48 h) collagen-induced MMP-2 activation was significantly and consistently attenuated by ∼ 50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>A, B). This was not the result of cell death in hypoxia, since cell numbers were similar over 7 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F), confirming that differences in MMP-2 activation were not attributable to variations in cell number. We repeated these experiments using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 in which hypoxic regulation of MMP-2 secretion and activation has previously been characterised <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In marked contrast to the myofibroblasts, but in agreement with this previous report, HT-1080 cells exhibited a significant increase in MMP-2 activation (∼ 200%) compared with normoxic controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>C, D). In further agreement with this same report, an intermediate band of MMP-2 activation (∼ 68 kDa) was observed in HT-1080 media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Thus, the effects of hypoxia observed in human cardiac myofibroblasts were markedly different from those seen in HT-1080 cells.</p>

        <title>Hypoxia attenuates MT1-MMP but does not affect TIMP-2 or MMP-2</title>
        <p>Activation of MMP-2 at the cell membrane requires formation of a ternary complex of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and proMMP-2 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether the observed reduction in MMP-2 activation in myofibroblasts cultured in hypoxia might be due to changes in total MMP-2, TIMP-2 and/or MT1-MMP expression. Densitometric analysis of gelatin zymograms demonstrated no change in total MMP-2 secretion in response to hypoxia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), and this was confirmed by ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Similarly, hypoxia had no effect on TIMP-2 protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). We next quantified levels of MT1-MMP mRNA and, because it is the active form of MT1-MMP that traffics to the plasma membrane to facilitate MMP-2 activation <xref rid="bib11 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[11,29]</xref>, we also measured MT1-MMP protein in cell membrane and whole cell fractions using ELISA and immunoblotting. Hypoxia did not alter steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). Immunocytochemistry revealed a general diffuse staining within the cytoplasm, with a more concentrated localisation of MT1-MMP at the cell periphery in normoxia. This association with the membrane was not apparent when cells were cultured under chronically hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). In keeping with the immunofluorescence findings, measurement of MT1-MMP in cell membrane preparations using ELISA showed a ∼ 40% reduction under hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). Measurement of total MT1-MMP in whole cell lysates (ELISA and immunoblotting) also indicated a ∼ 40% decrease with hypoxia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Lysosomal degradation of MT1-MMP is not enhanced by hypoxia</title>
        <p>As hypoxia reduced MT1-MMP protein without affecting MT1-MMP mRNA, we looked for evidence of hypoxia-induced MT1-MMP degradation. MT1-MMP is degraded by lysosomes <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, therefore cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin-A1 to determine whether the decrease in MMP-2 activation could be attributable to enhanced degradation of MT1-MMP. Zymographic analysis of CM from cells cultured in normoxia revealed that bafilomycin-A1 increased activation of MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>A, B). However, irrespective of bafilomycin-A1 treatment, cells cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibited attenuation of MMP-2 activation compared with normoxic counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>A, B).</p>

        <title>Hypoxia inhibits cardiac myofibroblast invasion, but not migration</title>
        <p>Cellular invasion requires two distinct phases; degradation of ECM followed by cellular migration towards a chemotactic stimulus. A 48 h hypoxic period led to a significant inhibition of myofibroblast invasion of almost 50% compared with normoxic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>A, B). This was associated with a corresponding decrease in MMP-2 activation in the supernatants from cells used in these experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>A, B). However, in the wound scratch assay, despite also observing a consistent inhibition of MMP-2 activation, there was no difference in cellular migration between the normoxic and hypoxic treatment groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>C, D). Immunocytochemical analysis of normoxic and hypoxic cells for the markers α-SMA and vimentin confirmed that the cells had retained their myofibroblast phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). These results together strongly suggest that MMP-2 activation is a prerequisite for cardiac myofibroblast invasion, but not migration.</p>

        <title>MT1-MMP is required for collagen-stimulated MMP-2 activation and invasion, but not migration</title>
        <p>Since we had demonstrated that hypoxia reduced invasion (but not migration), and also reduced both MT1-MMP protein levels together with MMP-2 activity, we sought to establish whether these effects were sufficient to inhibit myofibroblast invasion. Myofibroblasts transfected with siRNA targeting MT1-MMP or MMP-2 were cultured in collagen for 48 h and supernatants subjected to zymography. Total MMP-2 was selectively reduced by ∼ 50% with MMP-2 gene silencing, but was unaffected by MT1-MMP siRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>A, B). Cells transfected with MT1-MMP siRNA exhibited a ∼ 50% decrease in membrane MT1-MMP expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Importantly, selective silencing of either MT1-MMP or MMP-2 resulted in a significant reduction in active MMP-2 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D), to a level comparable with that observed in myofibroblasts during hypoxic culture.</p>
        <p>The functional roles of both MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were examined by studying siRNA-treated cells in invasion and migration assays. Silencing of either MT1-MMP or MMP-2 resulted in decreased cellular invasion of ∼ 50% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E). Parallel wound scratch assays revealed no difference in myofibroblast migration between control and transfected groups, confirming that cell motility <italic>per se</italic> is independent of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F). These observations concur with our observed effects of hypoxia on cell function, thus confirming the pivotal role of membrane-associated MT1-MMP activity in the mechanism of MMP-2 activation and invasion in this cell type.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study reveals mechanisms unique to human cardiac myofibroblasts of potential clinical significance, underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate experimental models. Cardiac myofibroblasts reside in a fibrillar collagen matrix <italic>in vivo</italic>, and we demonstrate here that collagen-supplemented <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures provide an appropriate physiological stimulus for activation of MMP-2 in human cardiac myofibroblasts. Moreover, myofibroblasts in culture are phenotypically comparable with their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and similar studies have also been reported for other fibroblast cultures <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We show here that MMP-2 activation is a prerequisite for cellular invasion, a process fundamental to promotion of the early, adaptive healing response after myocardial injury and is attenuated by hypoxia.</p>
      <p>Considerable evidence supports a role for MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in cellular invasion. ProMMP-2 displays a unique cell surface activation mechanism involving the formation of a trimolecular complex comprising MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and proMMP-2 <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[8–10]</xref>. Therefore, MMP-2 activation can be regulated by changes in expression and/or activation of any of these molecules. In marked contrast to previously published studies using a variety of cell types <xref rid="bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[14–17,32]</xref>, including rat cardiac fibroblasts <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, exposure to chronic hypoxia significantly attenuated MMP-2 activation in human cardiac myofibroblasts. These observations cannot be attributed to methodological variance since, in agreement with the study of Fahling et al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we also observed a significant increase in activation of MMP-2 by hypoxia in HT-1080 cells. Our findings for human cardiac myofibroblasts therefore represent a novel response to hypoxia.</p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies are usually conducted in an atmosphere of 95% air. This represents an O<sub>2</sub> level of 20%; far greater than any cellular exposure <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data emphasise the powerful effects of reducing O<sub>2</sub> levels to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during clinically important insults such as MI. Clearly, this level of hypoxia has profound effects on protein expression which can be mediated by numerous transcription factors including HIF-1, NFκB and CREB <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>TIMP-2, in addition to its principal role as the naturally-occurring physiological inhibitor of MMP-2, is also required for its activation, albeit at lower concentrations <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In our present study, although TIMP-2 was consistently detected, its concentration in conditioned media of both normoxic and hypoxic myofibroblasts was similar and therefore changes in TIMP-2 levels could not account for our observed changes in MMP-2 activation. It is well established that MT1-MMP is pivotal to MMP-2 activation; however reports are inconsistent with respect to its modulation under hypoxic conditions. That MT1-MMP mRNA was unchanged by hypoxia in our study is in agreement with previous reports <xref rid="bib16 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[16,32]</xref> although both those studies used inherently invasive cell lines and moreover, both reported increased MMP-2 activation in contrast to our observed decrease. However, other studies have reported either increased <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> or decreased <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> MT1-MMP mRNA levels, further emphasising the species and cell-type specific response to hypoxia. Here, although MT1-MMP mRNA levels were not modulated by hypoxia, total levels of protein within the cell and most importantly at the cell membrane were attenuated by ∼ 40%. Hypoxia was reported to reduce membrane-associated MT1-MMP in isolated porcine ventricular myocytes <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, but was increased in a breast cancer cell line <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, emphasising a role of MT1-MMP as a key regulator of cellular invasion.</p>
      <p>In direct contrast to previous reports in other cell types, chronic hypoxia significantly attenuated myofibroblast invasion in the present study. The reduced availability of membrane-associated MT1-MMP would be anticipated to prohibit ternary complex formation and thus lessen MMP-2 activation, accounting for the significant inhibition of invasion. We therefore demonstrated that transfection of myofibroblasts with MMP-2 siRNA reduced total MMP-2 secretion; additionally transfection with MT1-MMP siRNA resulted in both reduced membrane expression of MT1-MMP and reduced MMP-2 activation. Together these observations clearly delineate an essential role for both molecules in the mechanism of MMP-2 activation in human cardiac myofibroblasts. We therefore performed mechanistic and functional studies in parallel and confirmed that cardiac myofibroblast invasion was unequivocally dependent on MT1-MMP. These findings are in agreement with reports in other fibroblastic cell types <xref rid="bib37 bib38 bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[37–40]</xref>. Our study also indicated that knockdown of MMP-2 inhibited invasion as in human mesenchymal stem cells <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Conversely, others have reported that MMP-2 siRNA did not attenuate invasion by HT-1080 cells <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the significant effect on myofibroblast invasion, our data indicated that chemotaxis (migration) can proceed independently of changes in oxygen tension. Despite the lack of effect of hypoxia on myofibroblast migration, we did however observe a consistent attenuation of active MMP-2 in fibroblast-conditioned medium from these assays. Similarly, using MMP-2 siRNA or MT1-MMP siRNA-transfected cells, migration was not different from that of mock-transfected cells. Our results concur with a study reporting that migration of dermal fibroblasts from MT1-MMP null mice was comparable with those of wild-type mice <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, again cell type differences are reported with MT1-MMP knockdown decreasing migration in HT-1080 cells <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, membrane expression of active MT1-MMP in human cardiac myofibroblasts was pivotal for hypoxic modulation of both MMP-2 activation and cellular invasion. Hypoxia did not affect MT1-MMP gene expression and hence must modulate its post-transcriptional regulation. Potential targets for hypoxic regulation of MT1-MMP are many, and include activation of the proenzyme by proprotein convertases <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, membrane localisation, shedding, degradation and MT1-MMP phosphorylation <xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">[42,43]</xref>. The activity of furin, the proprotein convertase responsible for MT1-MMP activation, was increased under hypoxic conditions and therefore could not be accountable for the decreased levels of MT1-MMP (data not shown). Similarly the amount of soluble (“shed”) MT1-MMP in myofibroblast-conditioned media was not enhanced by chronic hypoxia (data not shown). Lysosomal inhibition of MT1-MMP degradation with bafilomycin-A1 led to a concentration-dependent increase in MMP-2 activation, as expected. However, this augmentation was observed under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, thereby ruling out increased lysosomal activity as the mediator of hypoxia-induced decrease in membrane-associated MT1-MMP. Taken together our data suggest that impairment of MT1-MMP protein translation is the most likely target of hypoxia, thereby reducing its availability for ternary complex formation, and consequent inhibition of MMP-2 activation.</p>
      <p>Hypoxia is only one of numerous cues that influence cardiac matrix remodelling through effects on MMPs, and although our current study investigated hypoxia <italic>per se</italic>, ischaemia-reperfusion injury is another key regulator of MMP activity that modulates its effects through alternative mechanism(s) <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Inflammatory mediators released early after MI also play key roles. For example, TNFα modulates long-term remodelling and ventricular dysfunction via increased MMP-2 activity <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In contrast, TGFβ may only play a short-term role; murine studies have reported that anti-TGFβ therapy prior to experimental MI decreased collagen I and MMP-9 mRNA expression after 3 days, but was ineffective by 8 weeks <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Activation of MMP-2 post-MI can have positive or negative effects that appear to be species dependent. For example, MMP-2 knockout rats exhibit preserved cardiac function after MI suggesting that excessive MMP-2 activation is deleterious <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In contrast, diabetic mice display reduced cardiac expression of both MMP-2 and MT1-MMP and increased fibrosis suggesting that increased MMP-2 activation plays a positive role <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Also worthy of note is that the time course of MMP-2 activation post-MI is variable between species; reportedly within 3 h in sheep infarct zone <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, but not evident in the mouse until 4 days post-MI <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, impaired cardiac myofibroblast invasion <italic>in vivo</italic> as a direct result of a period of oxygen deprivation may have deleterious sequelae on the myocardium by delaying early, adaptive remodelling following MI. Taking into account our own and previously published studies, it is clearly evident that species and cell-type variation is a major determinant of cellular responses to distinct stimuli. The multiplicity of reported differences between studies (for review see <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>) underscores the importance of selecting as far as possible, appropriate experimental models. Such considerations are of direct relevance to human disease, and our use of atrial-derived myofibroblasts may have imposed some constraint on the present study. Canine atrial and ventricular cells are claimed to exhibit inherent differences <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, but importantly, the behaviour of human atrial and ventricular cells has been reported to be similar <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The study described here, by the use of cardiac myofibroblasts from a series of patients in well established laboratory models of migration and invasion, endeavours to represent the <italic>in vivo</italic> scenario in man. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of hypoxia on human cardiac myofibroblast function may ultimately reveal potential novel targets amenable to therapeutic manipulation.</p>

        <p>Effect of hypoxia on total MMP-2, TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression. Cardiac myofibroblasts were cultured with collagen under normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h. Conditioned media were analysed by ELISA for (A) total (pro- and active) MMP-2 or (B) total TIMP-2. NS = not significant (<italic>n</italic> = 5). (C) Cells were cultured with collagen under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h before extracting RNA and performing real-time RT-PCR.
