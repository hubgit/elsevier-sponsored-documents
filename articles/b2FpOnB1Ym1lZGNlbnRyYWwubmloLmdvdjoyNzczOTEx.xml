      <abstract>
        <p>Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise is reported to occur in up to a third of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases and is associated with an increased risk of death, particularly in the young, but it is not known whether the HCM-causing mutation influences blood pressure response to exercise. The purpose of this article is to ascertain whether the blood pressure response to exercise differs among carriers of the R92W mutation in the cardiac troponin T gene (<italic>TNNT2</italic>), which has been associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in young males; carriers of mutations in the cardiac β-myosin heavy chain gene (<italic>MYH7</italic>); and their noncarrier relatives. Thirty R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers, 51 <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers, and 68 of their noncarrier relatives were subjected to bicycle ergonometric exercise testing to assess blood pressure response to, as well as heart rate recovery after, exercise. Additional echocardiographic and demographic details were documented for all participants. R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers demonstrated significantly more abnormal blood pressure responses to exercise (<italic>P</italic> = .021; odds ratio 3.03; confidence interval 1.13–8.12) and smaller increases in systolic blood pressure than <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers or related noncarrier control individuals. Although abnormal blood pressure response occurred at similar frequencies in males in all groups (23%–26%), the percentage of R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> females with abnormal blood pressure response was 64%, compared with 25% for <italic>MYH7</italic> and 22% for noncarriers. Therefore, these results show that blood pressure response to exercise is influenced by genotype and gender in patients with HCM.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a primary cardiac muscle disease with 0.2% prevalence,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> is characterized primarily by thickening of the ventricular wall in the absence of other hypertrophy-predisposing conditions<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and by an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD), which may relate to changes in cardiac energy and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis or histopathological changes in the myocardium.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> HCM is typically caused by mutations in genes encoding protein components of the cardiac sarcomere (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/~seidman/cg3/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/∼seidman/cg3/index.html</ext-link>), with the three most common causes being mutations in the genes encoding beta cardiac myosin heavy chain (<italic>MYH7</italic>), cardiac troponin T (<italic>TNNT2</italic>), and myosin binding protein C. Although the phenotypes resulting from these genetic defects vary greatly, mutations in <italic>TNNT2</italic> in humans<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,4</sup></xref> and in animal models<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,6</sup></xref> have frequently resulted in an increased susceptibility to SCD, often in the presence of mild or absent cardiac hypertrophy. We have previously reported an increased frequency of SCD, affecting young males in particular, in HCM families in which the R92W mutation in <italic>TNNT2</italic> segregates,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> although the reason for this poor prognosis was not investigated at the time.</p>
      <p>Blood pressure response to exercise testing is commonly used as an indicator of risk for SCD in patients with HCM. The failure of blood pressure to increase appropriately in response to exercise has been recorded in 8%–33% of ungenotyped patients with HCM.<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8–10</sup></xref> Abnormal blood pressure responses have been associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality<xref rid="bib8 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,11</sup></xref> and have a reported 15% positive predictive value for SCD in HCM.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> It is not known whether the blood pressure response to exercise in HCM is influenced by genotype.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that the R92W mutation, which confers a high rate of SCD, may be associated with an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. Here we investigated this hypothesis by comparing the blood pressure response to exercise in carriers of the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutation with that of carriers of HCM-causing mutations in the cardiac β-<italic>MYH7</italic> mutations (A797T and R403W) and noncarrier relatives.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Stellenbosch Health Sciences Faculty (N04/03/062). Individuals belonging to consecutively identified HCM families in which either of three founder HCM-causing mutations segregate (R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub>, A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub>, R403W<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub>)<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> who did not have pacemakers, who were in sinus rhythm at the time of the exercise test, and who gave written informed consent were included in this study.</p>
        <p>A medical and family history was taken, and age, sex, height, and weight as well as sudden death events that had occurred in family members were recorded for each participant. Only sudden deaths occurring in genotyped mutation carriers, or obligate heterozygotes, or individuals with a diagnosis of HCM, or with a history of syncope were considered as SCDs. Blood pressure was taken twice in the sitting position, after 5 minutes of bed rest, and the second measurement was used. Individuals were coded as hypertensive if they on more than one occasion had systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 or were on antihypertensive medication.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>Exercise testing</title>
        <p>We performed 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) on a MAC 1200ST machine after 5 minutes of rest in the supine position and from this determined a resting heart rate (HR) and whether normal sinus rhythm was present. All cardioactive medications were discontinued for at least 5 pharmacokinetic half-lives before exercise testing. Exercise testing was performed by practitioners who were blinded to the genotype status of the participants.</p>
        <p>Maximum symptom-limited bicycle ergonometric exercise testing was performed according to the following protocol: eight stages over 24 minutes with incremental increase of 25 W every 2 minutes (25–200 W). Concurrent continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring was performed with the Norav Medical System. SBP and DBP were recorded with a mercury sphygmomanometer by a trained nurse (AG). Blood pressure values were recorded at rest, at 1-minute intervals during exercise, and at 1-minute intervals for 5 minutes during the recovery period.</p>
        <p>We recorded the maximal workload achieved (in metabolic equivalents [METs]), total exercise time (in minutes and seconds), the maximum SBP and DBP achieved during exercise, the SBP and DBP and HR at peak exercise and at 1-minute intervals during recovery, and the percentage of predicted maximal HR for age and sex achieved by peak exercise. The predicted maximal HR was calculated as 220 minus age for men and 210 minus age for women.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Chronotropic reserve (CR) was calculated as described elsewhere.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Normal blood pressure response was defined as an increase of at least 20 mmHg in SBP during exercise, with a gradual decline during recovery.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Abnormal blood pressure responses were defined as either (1) an initial increase in SBP with a subsequent fall of &gt;20 mmHg compared with the blood pressure value at peak exercise or a continuous decrease in SBP throughout the exercise test of &gt;20 mmHg compared with resting blood pressure (termed hypotensive responses) or (2) an increase of &lt;20 mmHg in SBP from resting state to peak exercise (termed a flat response).</p>
        <p>Exercise was terminated for any of the following reasons: reaching target HR, fatigue, severe dyspnea, significant chest pain, near syncope, or development of arrhythmias.</p>

        <title>Echocardiography</title>
        <p>Echocardiography was performed on all participating individuals, using a standardized procedure, by a single experienced echocardiographer (MR) who was blinded to mutation status. A GE Healthcare Vivid7 cardiovascular ultrasound system was used to determine maximum wall thickness at 16 left ventricular (LV) wall segments on M-mode and two-dimensional images, as described elsewhere.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Overall maximum LV wall thickness (maxLVWT) was recorded for each individual.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Thirty R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers from seven families, 51 <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers (27 A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> carriers from 10 families, 24 R403W<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> carriers from three families) and 68 of their noncarrier relatives participated in exercise testing. The relevant clinical and demographic characteristics of these individuals are given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Total exercise time, workload, and percentage of target HR achieved were similar between groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> families, SCD had affected predominantly young males (eight males, age at SCD 22.5 ± 10 years [mean ± standard deviation]; one female, 62 years; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers, five male (mean age at SCD 35.8 ± 17.3 years) and three female (mean age at SCD 32 ± 20.2 years) A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> carriers experienced SCD before the study. At least five of the <italic>MYH7</italic> and all R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> SCDs had occurred during periods of physical activity or emotional excitement (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). One SCD in each of the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> and <italic>MYH7</italic> groups occurred in females &gt;40 years.</p>
      <p>Whereas abnormal blood pressure response to exercise occurred in about a quarter of control individuals or individuals carrying either <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation, this phenomenon was present in significantly more, that is, nearly half, of R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No individuals demonstrated a continuous decrease in SBP throughout the exercise test. Flat abnormal blood pressure responses predominated in all groups but were the only type of abnormal blood pressure response in R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Statistical analysis indicated that R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers were 3 times as likely to demonstrate an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise compared with either <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers or noncarrier control individuals (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This was particularly noticeable for female R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>); the percentage of females with abnormal blood pressure response for R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> was 64%, for <italic>MYH7</italic> 25%, and for noncarriers 22%. In contrast, the percentage of males with abnormal blood pressure response was similar for the three groups (R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> 24%; <italic>MYH7</italic> 23%; noncarriers 26%).</p>
      <p>After adjustment for age, sex, resting mean arterial pressure, and resting HR, the effect of exercise on HR and DBP parameters (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was not different between groups. However, R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers achieved a significantly lower mean SBP at peak exercise, as well as a smaller mean change (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and a smaller percentage of change in SBP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) between resting and peak exercise, than did noncarriers and <italic>MYH7</italic> mutation carriers.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we also observed that, while the mean rate of SBP change increased in the first 3 minutes of exercise in the control and <italic>MYH7</italic> groups, R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers on average demonstrated a slight decrease in the rate at which SBP changed during the first 3 minutes of exercise (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, perhaps owing to the small numbers of individuals involved, this difference was not statistically significant.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise has been associated with HCM-related death, with patients &lt;50 years old showing a fourfold increase in premature HCM-related death.<xref rid="bib8 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,11</sup></xref> However, it is unknown whether abnormal blood pressure response is influenced by the HCM-causing genotype. Here we show that individuals carrying the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutation are 3 times as likely to experience abnormal blood pressure response upon exercise compared with those carrying either of two <italic>MYH7</italic> mutations or noncarrier controls.</p>
      <p>We have previously described an increased frequency of SCD, predominantly affecting young males in their teenage years, in two ancestrally related families in which the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutation segregates.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In this study, we report SCDs in a further two of five additional R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> families identified (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); these families have been shown by genetic haplotype analysis (data not shown) to be ancestrally related to the original two R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> families.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> While SCD had occurred in four (57%) of the seven R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> families, predominantly affecting young men in their teenage years, SCD in <italic>MYH7</italic> families was limited to those in which the A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> mutation segregates (five [50%] of 10 A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> families, 39% of total <italic>MYH7</italic> families) and mostly affected adult individuals (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similar to our first report of the clinical picture associated with R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers, overt hypertrophy was a rare occurrence in the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> group<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> but occurred more frequently in the <italic>MYH7</italic> group (n = 4, all A797T<sub><italic>MYH7</italic></sub> carriers), while syncope occurred at comparable levels in both mutation groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>We found that carriers of the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutation demonstrate abnormal blood pressure response to exercise significantly more frequently (<xref rid="tbl2 tbl4" ref-type="table">Tables 2 and 4</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .021, odds ratio = 3.03) and show smaller absolute (ΔSBP, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and relative (% change from resting SBP, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) changes in SBP than do carriers of <italic>MYH7</italic> mutations or related noncarrier control individuals. Thus, our study of the largest number of cases with an identical mutation in the <italic>TNNT2</italic> gene to date provides strong evidence for the influence of genotype on hemodynamic response in HCM.</p>
      <p>In R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers, abnormal blood pressure responses were always of the flat type, namely, a failure to increase SBP by &gt;20 mmHg between resting and peak exercise state. This finding, as well as the smaller increases in SBP observed in this study in the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> group during exercise (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), supports the results of Sakata et al,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> who recently reported that a group consisting of carriers of diverse troponin mutations demonstrated a smaller increase in SBP during exercise than did individuals without troponin mutations.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms underlying abnormal blood pressure response to exercise in HCM are not yet completely understood. While some studies indicate that this response is due to an exaggerated decrease in systemic vascular resistance,<xref rid="bib9 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,21</sup></xref> other studies suggest that impaired cardiac output is responsible for exercise hypotension.<xref rid="bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,23</sup></xref> Although it remains possible that either or a combination of both mechanisms are at play in subsets of HCM patients,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Sakata et al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> found that systemic vascular resistance decreased to a similar extent in the <italic>TNNT2</italic> and non-<italic>TNNT2</italic> groups. They proposed that their findings related to the systolic dysfunction, which would result in decreased cardiac output that developed only in the <italic>TNNT2</italic> group during exercise.</p>
      <p>The development of abnormal blood pressure response may also be related to autonomic control, as studies of neurotransmitter levels before and after exercise have also previously indicated that HCM patients manifest a sympathoadrenal imbalance during exercise.<xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25,26</sup></xref> The cause of this imbalance is not known, nor is it known whether this imbalance is genotype related, but it has been suggested that the enhanced systolic function that occurs under resting conditions in transgenic mutant <italic>TNNT2</italic> mice,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> as well as in prehypertrophic R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> may activate ventricular mechanoreceptors and cause chronic alterations in vagal tone. On the other hand, Kawasaki et al<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> recently demonstrated that subendocardial ischemia, which occurs in about 50% of HCM patients upon exercise,<xref rid="bib23 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,28</sup></xref> leads to vagal enhancement in patients with HCM, which may be related to the development of abnormal blood pressure response to exercise.</p>
      <p>The preponderance of abnormal blood pressure response in females in the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> group might be explained by vagal enhancement, which results from either mechanism proposed above, occurring on the background of the normally predominantly parasympathetically biased cardiac regulation in females.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The preponderance of abnormal blood pressure response in female R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers, who experience less SCD than their male counterparts, could suggest that this hemodynamic factor is not causally associated with the high frequency of sudden death with exercise that we have observed in the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> group. However, in light of previous longitudinal studies indicating an increase in premature HCM-related death among HCM patients demonstrating abnormal blood pressure response to exercise,<xref rid="bib8 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,11</sup></xref> the survival and abnormal blood pressure response data in this study may suggest that a parasympathetic shift is not well tolerated in the predominantly sympathetically regulated male hearts.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Failure to increase SBP appropriately during exercise is indicative of severe coronary artery disease in the general population<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> and is more marked for those who fail to increase SBP appropriately during the first 3 minutes of exercise rather than later on during exercise.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This is interesting, given our preliminary observation of the rate of change in SBP, which suggests that individuals with the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutation may fail to increase blood pressure appropriately, particularly early on during exercise (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast to the high rate of abnormal blood pressure response to exercise in the R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> group, the frequency of abnormal blood pressure response to exercise in the <italic>MYH7</italic> group was similar to that reported for genotype-unknown HCM patients<xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,9</sup></xref> and was equal to that observed in the control group of noncarrier relatives (62% from <italic>MYH7</italic> and 38% from R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> families). However, the frequency of abnormal blood pressure response to exercise in this control group was much higher than that reported for a non–South African general population (2%–8%).<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The reason for this is not immediately clear; however, half of the control individuals with abnormal blood pressure response in this study were overweight or obese (body mass index &gt;25), perhaps indicating a risk for coronary artery disease and silent myocardial ischemia.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Other reported causes of an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise include valvular heart disease, orthostatic hypotension, and the use of drugs such as vasodilators, negative inotropic agents, and diuretics.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Individuals with R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> mutations demonstrate abnormal blood pressure response to exercise significantly more frequently than do individuals with <italic>MYH7</italic> mutations or noncarrier controls, indicating that abnormal blood pressure response is influenced by genotype. The preponderance of female R92W<sub><italic>TNNT2</italic></sub> carriers with abnormal blood pressure response, with a lower risk of SCD than affected males, supports the suggestion that abnormal blood pressure response may be associated with a parasympathetic shift in the regulation of cardiac function and that parasympathetic shifts are not well tolerated in predominantly sympathetically regulated male hearts. Although implantable defibrillators are the most effective life-saving therapy available for prevention of SCD in HCM, this option is not widely available outside of developed nations owing to cost. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying SCD in HCM may eventually facilitate development of alternative effective therapeutic options.</p>
