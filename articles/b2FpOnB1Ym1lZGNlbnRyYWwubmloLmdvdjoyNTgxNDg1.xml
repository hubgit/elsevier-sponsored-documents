        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Cyclic ADP-ribose is an important Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing cytosolic messenger synthesized from β-NAD<sup>+</sup> by ADP-ribosyl cyclases (ARCs). However, the focus upon ectocellular mammalian ARCs (CD38 and CD157) has led to confusion as to how extracellular enzymes generate intracellular messengers in response to stimuli. We have cloned and characterized three ARCs in the sea urchin egg and found that endogenous ARCβ and ARCγ are intracellular and located within the lumen of acidic, exocytotic vesicles, where they are optimally active. Intraorganelle ARCs are shielded from cytosolic substrate and targets by the organelle membrane, but this barrier is circumvented by nucleotide transport. We show that a β-NAD<sup>+</sup> transporter provides ARC substrate that is converted luminally to cADPR, which, in turn, is shuttled out to the cytosol via a separate cADPR transporter. Moreover, nucleotide transport is integral to ARC activity physiologically because three transport inhibitors all inhibited the fertilization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave that is dependent upon cADPR. This represents a novel signaling mechanism whereby an extracellular stimulus increases the concentration of a second messenger by promoting messenger transport from intraorganelle synthesis sites to the cytosol.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>The mechanisms coupling extracellular stimuli to synthesis of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) are poorly understood. ADP-ribosyl cyclases (ARCs) synthesize cADPR from β-NAD<sup>+</sup> <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1, 2]</xref> (and possibly another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing messenger, NAADP, though this remains uncertain physiologically <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3, 4]</xref>). The fact that mammalian ARC isoforms (CD38 and CD157) appear to be primarily ectocellular <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1, 2]</xref> has raised questions as to how they could generate intracellular messengers in a regulated manner <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Cloning of Sea Urchin ARCs</title>
        <p>To address these issues, we cloned and characterized three ARC enzymes from sea urchin egg where cADPR and ARC were first discovered <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Using CD38, CD157, and <italic>Aplysia</italic> ARC as query sequences to probe the <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> genome <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and expressed-sequence tag (EST) cDNA databases <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we identified three ARC isoforms, ARCα, ARCβ, and ARCγ. To obtain the complete cDNA sequences, we designed gene-specific primers and carried out RT-PCR with total RNA from <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> eggs, ovaries, or testes. The cDNA sequences obtained for ARCα, ARCβ, and ARCγ have open reading frames corresponding to proteins with predicted molecular masses of 36.3, 35.4, and 40.1 kDa, all containing the ARC domain (Rib-hydrolase), catalytic residues, and critical disulphide bridges (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The mRNAs for all three ARCs were found in ovary, testis, and egg (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D). Recently, sea urchin ARCs were cloned via a different approach <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and our slightly different sequences are probably attributable to polymorphisms <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> identified in multiple independent RT-PCR clones (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E). Sea urchin ARCs are predicted to be membrane bound with different modes of membrane attachment (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Immunolocalization of ARCs in Sea Urchin Eggs</title>
        <p>The subcellular distribution of endogenous ARCs is currently unknown, so we first examined immunofluorescence in eggs costained with Lysotracker Red to label acidic organelles. In fixed, permeabilized eggs, specific ARC staining was peripheral for all isoforms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B, 1F, and 1J) but with crucial differences: ARCα staining was ectocellular at the outer edge of the Lysotracker Red staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), was smooth in three-dimensional reconstructions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E), and was even observed in nonpermeabilized eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, ARCβ and ARCγ were intracellular proteins that colocalized with Lysotracker Red (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>F and 1J), distributed in punctate vesicles 1–2 μm in diameter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>I and 1M), and not observed in nonpermeabilized eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>H and 1L). The distribution of ARCβ and ARCγ was not mimicked by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the localization of ARCβ and ARCγ was reminiscent of cortical granules, the acidic, exocytotic vesicles that are docked at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>N) to generate the fertilization envelope <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We confirmed this locus in a number of ways. First, unlike other organelles, cortical granules do not migrate upon stratification of live eggs by centrifugation unless pretreated with urethane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>O and 1S) <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Accordingly, ARCβ and ARCγ remained peripheral in untreated stratified eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Q and 1R), but were dislodged and migrated in urethane-treated eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>U and 1V). In contrast, ARCα staining remained peripheral with (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>T) or without (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>P) urethane, as expected for a plasma membrane and/or vitelline layer (PMVL, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>N) protein.</p>
        <p>Second, by the shearing of adherent eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), cortical lawns that comprised cortical ER, docked cortical granules, and PMVL were prepared <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Spheroid cortical granules stained positively for hyalin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B, 2D, and 2F), which colocalized with ARCβ and ARCγ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2F) but not ARCα (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). Importantly, ARCβ and ARCγ appeared to be luminal because immunostaining was not seen in unpermeabilized lawns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and 2G).</p>
        <p>Third, electron microscopy and immunogold labeling confirmed that ARCβ and ARCγ associate with the cortical granule lumen, but not with underlying yolk platelets, cytosol, or ER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>H–2K). The data support an ectocellular ARCα, whereas ARCβ and ARCγ are within the cortical granule lumen.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec1.3">
        <title>pH Dependence of ARC Activity and Distribution in Subcellular Fractions</title>
        <p>We extended these studies by using biochemical cell fractionation. Cell-surface complexes (CSCs, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>N) were prepared and further fractionated into their constituent PMVL and cortical granules where indicated. In agreement with the above, ARCα was only detected in CSCs and PMVL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), whereas ARCβ and ARCγ were confirmed in CSCs and cortical granules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>A luminal localization of ARCβ was further reinforced. First, eggs were treated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore to induce cortical granule exocytosis, and ARCβ was then detected in the surrounding exudate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), consistent with its release from the cortical granule lumen, possibly by clipping of the putative transmembrane domain (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>F) by resident proteases <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. By contrast, ARCα and ARCγ did not appear in the exudate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), presumably because of membrane attachment (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>F). Second, ARC activity in CSCs or cortical granules was enhanced upon vesicle lysis, consistent with restricted substrate access when intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Taken together, these data overwhelmingly suggest that ARCα is ectocellular whereas ARCβ and ARCγ reside within the lumen of the cortical granule, the first molecularly identified ARCs to be found exclusively within an organelle.</p>
        <p>Our conclusion differs with the heterologous expression of one recombinant ARC (equivalent to our ARCβ) localized in the ER <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. One possibility is that this is a function of the expression system because another cortical granule protein (SFE9) is also retained within the ER when expressed heterologously (data not shown).</p>
        <p>We next asked whether luminal ARCs are active. Cortical granules are acidic vesicles (pH ∼5.5, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>), and, fittingly, recombinant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D) and endogenous (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) sea urchin ARCs preferentially synthesize cADPR (and not ADPR) at acidic pH. Lysed cortical granules were also separated into membranes, and soluble proteins and ARC activity was greater for the soluble fraction at pH 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The low activity in the particulate fraction at pH 5 (close to the predicted pIs of 4.7 and 5.7 for ARCβ and ARCγ, respectively) is probably due to protein aggregation and precipitation at this pH (data not shown; cf. CD38 inactivation <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Our findings confirm that ARC activity is compartmentalized within the lumen of an organelle with an optimal pH.</p>
        <p>Exoplasmic sea urchin ARCs contrast with reports of soluble ARC activity <xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[14, 15]</xref>, but this may be an artifact of homogenate preparation where Ca<sup>2+</sup> contamination promotes cortical granule exocytosis <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the disgorging of ARC to the “cytosol.” Homogenate prepared in the presence of EGTA [glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-tetra acetic acid] preserves vesicular integrity and ARC remains luminal (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>) until lysed or treated with excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec1.4">
        <title>Nucleotide Transport and Fertilization Ca<sup>2+</sup> Signals</title>
        <p>If ARCs are luminally active, then substrates and products must be transported in and out during stimulation (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>) and the small ARC activity in intact CSCs and cortical granules is consistent with transport (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Therefore, we investigated the effect of transport inhibitors upon physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p>
        <p>At fertilization, cADPR contributes to the prominent Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (spike upstroke) <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16, 17]</xref> via ARC <xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18, 19]</xref>. In control eggs, fertilization induced a cortical flash followed by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave that crossed the egg in ∼14 s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4D). With the cADPR transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DPM) <xref rid="bib5 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[5, 20]</xref>, the early events (the cortical flash and Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave initiation) were relatively unaffected (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S6</xref>A and S6B; p &gt; 0.05), whereas the wave transit time (p &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and 4D) and the antipodal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (p &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>B) were dramatically slowed. Globally, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplitude was reduced (p &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4F). Note that the intracellular DPM concentration is ∼10% of the extracellular (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). This partial inhibition by DPM mimics cADPR antagonism or ryanodine receptor inhibition <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16, 17]</xref>.</p>
        <p>At fertilization, cADPR acts synergistically with IP<sub>3</sub>, and, consequently, cADPR antagonism appears more striking when IP<sub>3</sub> is antagonized with heparin <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16, 17]</xref>. Heparin alone did not affect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplitude but extended the lag (p &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). However, heparin and DPM together almost completely blocked the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F), consistent with DPM acting upon the cADPR pathway.</p>
        <p>We also tested other nucleotide transport inhibitors, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) <xref rid="bib5 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[5, 20]</xref> and indoprofen <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21, 22]</xref>. Alone, these agents had no effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F, p &gt; 0.05), but, like DPM, they synergistically inhibited the response in heparinized eggs (albeit less efficaciously than DPM, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Note that at relevant concentrations, these inhibitors did not directly inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> release evoked by IP<sub>3</sub>, cADPR, or NAADP (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>A–S7C), nor did they directly inhibit ARC (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>D). All inhibitors act in a manner diagnostic for antagonism of the cADPR pathway.</p>
        <p>DPM was used to narrow down the locus of action. We circumvented fertilization by injecting ARC substrate, β-NAD<sup>+</sup>, which releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon its conversion to cADPR <xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18, 19]</xref>. DPM blocked the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to β-NAD<sup>+</sup> (p &lt; 0.01) but not to the product, cADPR (p &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G–4I), pointing to an inhibition of ARC that must be indirect (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>D). We also discount side effects of transport inhibitors upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H), and upon the activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and cyclo-oxygenase (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>More is known about plasmalemmal β-NAD<sup>+</sup> and cADPR transport <xref rid="bib5 bib20 bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[5, 20, 23, 24]</xref> than organelle nucleotide fluxes <xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[25–27]</xref>. Therefore, we characterized transport in cortical granules by using [<sup>32</sup>P]β-NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>J–4L). [<sup>32</sup>P]β-NAD<sup>+</sup> uptake into the lumen via specific sites was confirmed with digitonin lysis and unlabeled β-NAD<sup>+</sup>, respectively. DPM enhanced <sup>32</sup>P accumulation (p &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>J) in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S9</xref>) and was replicated by NBTI at 1 μM (175 ± 15%, n = 7) and 10 μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>K). By contrast, indoprofen reduced <sup>32</sup>P accumulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>K).</p>
        <p>Our explanation is that indoprofen affects the β-NAD<sup>+</sup> transporter, whereas DPM and NBTI block [<sup>32</sup>P]cADPR efflux <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, thereby trapping it in the lumen. Indeed, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis confirmed that [<sup>32</sup>P]cADPR is generated within the lumen and that DPM selectively enhanced [<sup>32</sup>P]cADPR accumulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L). We conclude that organellar nucleotide transport is an integral element of the ARC signaling cascade.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Our understanding of ARC regulation has been hitherto confounded by the focus upon ectocellular ARCs <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Instead, we propose that ARCs natively sequestered within acidic organelles are the most important forms. Reports of ARCs that are intracellular <xref rid="bib2 bib5 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[2, 5, 28]</xref> and capable of synthesizing cADPR at acidic pH <xref rid="bib29 bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[29–31]</xref> hint at a significance beyond the sea urchin egg. At fertilization, ARCβ and ARCγ locally provide cADPR for cortical Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to drive exocytosis <xref rid="bib16 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[16, 32]</xref> and then for global Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves following cADPR diffusion <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We speculate that multiple mechanisms modulate ARC at fertilization (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>), including transporter phosphorylation (possibly via cGMP <xref rid="bib15 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[15, 18]</xref>), changes in cortical granule pH <xref rid="bib10 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[10, 33]</xref>, and exocytosis. Subsequent endocytosis (and endosomal acidification) <xref rid="bib5 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[5, 34]</xref> could even replenish and reactivate membrane-bound ARCs.</p>
        <p>In spite of the presence of ARCα, ectocellular synthesis of cADPR cannot occur <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, probably because of the inhibitory pH of sea water. However, ectocellular proteins reach the cell surface via the lumen of a secretory pathway <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and ARCα is indeed vesicular in immature oocytes (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S10</xref>), where it may play a role during egg maturation when cADPR responses begin to appear <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus ARC effectiveness may depend upon when it is in its active, vesicular form.</p>
        <p>The identity of the transporters is unclear, but the differential pharmacology of β-NAD<sup>+</sup> uptake and cADPR release suggests different proteins. Nonetheless, we can exclude the candidate β-NAD<sup>+</sup> transporter, connexin 43 <xref rid="bib5 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[5, 24]</xref>, because connexins are absent from the sea urchin genome <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, we propose a model whereby cell-surface stimuli couple to vesicular ARCs by regulating vesicle substrate and/or product transporters and vesicle pH. Our results further raise the profile of acidic vesicles as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling organelles—not only are they Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but they are also reservoirs of second messenger mobilized by physiological stimuli.</p>

        <title>Preparations of Eggs and Subfractions</title>
        <p>For stratification, dejellied eggs were centrifuged on a cushion of 1 M sucrose at 17,500 × g for 30 min. For dislodging cortical granules, eggs were suspended in 400 mM urethane immediately before and during centrifugation. Published methods were used to prepare cortical lawns, egg homogenates, CSCs, and cortical granules (CGs) (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>). Exudates were collected from A23187-stimulated live eggs.</p>
        <p>CSCs or CGs were hypotonically lysed in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7) or 10 mM acetate (pH 5), as confirmed by the release of Lysotracker Red (data not shown). The particulate and soluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 hr.</p>

        <title>Immunolocalization</title>
        <p>Antibodies specific for ARC isoforms were raised commercially in rabbits with specific peptides (ARCα and ARCβ, Covalab; ARCγ, Eurogentec) and affinity purified. Eggs and cortical lawns were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and ovary sections with 10% formalin. Permeabilization was effected with 0.2% Triton X-100 where indicated. Some egg preparations were stained with 1 μM Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen) for 20 min prior to fixation. Primary antibody staining was visualized with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and confocal laser-scanning microscopy with standard green or red filters.</p>
        <p>For electron microscopy, eggs were fixed, mounted, and visualized with affinity-purified anti-ARC antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to 15 nm colloidal gold particles.</p>

        <p>(B–M) Eggs stained with Lysotracker Red DND-99 (red) were fixed, permeabilized (unless otherwise indicated), and labeled (green) with antibodies against ARCα (B–E), ARCβ (F–I), and ARCγ (J–M). The following are shown: cortical staining with ARC antibodies (B, F, and J); staining blocked with competing antigenic peptides (C, G, and K); nonpermeabilized eggs (D, H, and L); and 3D reconstruction of sequential z sections (E, I, and M).</p>
        <p>(N–V) Stratified eggs studies. (N) Schematic representation of the stratification of intracellular organelles. Staining for the cortical granule marker protein, hyalin, or ARCs in the absence (O–R) or presence (S–V) of urethane is shown. Scale bars represent 2 μm (B) and 10 μm (C).</p>

        <p>Schematic representation (A) of cortical lawn preparation by the shearing of eggs adhering to coverslips (B–G). Cortical lawns stained (green) for ARCα (B and C), ARCβ (D and E), ARCγ (F and G) in fixed, permeabilized (B, D, and F), or live, unpermeabilized samples (C, E, and G). Fixed samples were costained for the cortical granule protein hyalin (red). Fluorescence images are shown (left) and are overlayed with DIC images (right).</p>
        <p>(H–K) Immunogold localization and quantification of ARCβ (H and I) and ARCγ (J and K). For clarity, micrographs represent magnified cortical regions that do not include the entire region used for quantification. (I and K) Quantification of labeling in cytosol (cyt), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cortical granules (CG), and yolk platelets (yolk); vertical bars display standard deviation for tallies from six different eggs.</p>
        <p>The images in (B)–(E) are depicted on a common scale; those in (F) and (G) share a different scale. Scale bars represents 10 μm (B) and 1 μm (F, H, and J).</p>

        <p>Nucleotide Transport in Cortical Granules Is Required for Fertilization Ca<sup>2+</sup> Responses</p>
        <p>(A–D) Effect of dipyridamole (DPM) upon fertilization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in control (plus DMSO) (A) and DPM-treated eggs (B) are shown; image numbers represent the time (s) after wave initiation. The intracellular [DPM] is ∼10% of the extracellular concentration (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>). The effect of DPM upon the global main Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike (C) and wave kinetics (D) is shown (n = 4–32 eggs).</p>
        <p>(E and F) Effect of transport inhibitors with or without heparin (250 mg/ml pipette concentration) upon fertilization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. (E) Traces represent global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals upon fertilization in control (Ctrl) and heparin-injected (hep) eggs incubated with either DMSO or 30 μM DPM. (F) A summary of the effect of DPM, indoprofen (indo), and nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) upon the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplitude in eggs injected with or without heparin is shown (n = 12–32). Heparin increased the lag from 13 ± 1 s to 38 ± 2 s (n = 29–33, p &lt; 0.001). Responses are normalized to the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in control eggs (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 2.38 ± 0.19, n = 32). Eggs were treated with 30 μM DPM for 3 min, 500 μM indoprofen for 5 min, or 100 μM NBTI for 45–90 min (<sup>∗∗</sup>, p &lt; 0.01 and <sup>∗∗∗</sup>, p &lt; 0.001, comparing inhibitors with or without heparin; ##, p &lt; 0.01 and ###, p &lt; 0.001 versus heparin plus DMSO).</p>
        <p>(G–I) Effect of DPM upon signals in response to nucleotide injection: 30 μM DPM inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to microinjection of β-NAD<sup>+</sup> (5–10 mM pipette concentration [G and I]) but not to cADPR (30 μM pipette concentration [H and I]); n = 44–51 eggs. (G and H) Control ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>: β-NAD<sup>+</sup>, 2.71 ± 0.31 (n = 44); cADPR, 2.19 ± 0.19 (n = 50); without nucleotides, 0.43 ± 0.10 (n = 13).

Raw radioactivity of DMSO control, 3251 ± 658 d.p.m.</p>
        <p>(L) Identification of luminal <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleotides by TLC analysis, after an 18 min incubation of CSC with [<sup>32</sup>P]β-NAD<sup>+</sup> in the presence of 0.8% DMSO or 16 μM DPM (n = 4, <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.01 versus DMSO). Spot intensities (arbitrary units) with DMSO are as follows: β-NAD<sup>+</sup>, 1696 ± 274; cADPR, 354 ± 94. Note that in these experiments, [<sup>32</sup>P]ADPR levels were not consistently above the level of detection.</p>
