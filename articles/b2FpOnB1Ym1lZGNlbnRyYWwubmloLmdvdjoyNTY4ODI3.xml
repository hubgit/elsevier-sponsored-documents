        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. UCP2 content, measured by calibrated immunoblot in INS-1E insulinoma cells (a pancreatic beta-cell model) grown in RPMI medium, and INS-1E mitochondria, was 2.0 ng/million cells (7.9 ng/mg mitochondrial protein). UCP2 content was lower in cells incubated without glutamine and higher in cells incubated with 20 mM glucose, and varied from 1.0–4.4 ng/million cells (2.7–14.5 ng/mg mitochondrial protein). This dynamic response to nutrients was achieved by varied expression rates against a background of a very short UCP2 protein half-life of about 1 h.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pancreatic beta-cells maintain glycaemic control by secreting insulin in response to high glucose concentrations. Mitochondria play an important role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by coupling glucose oxidation to ATP production. Glucose oxidation raises the mitochondrial protonmotive force and increases the ATP:ADP ratio, leading to closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, plasma membrane depolarisation, activation of voltage-gated calcium channels, and an influx of calcium that promotes exocytosis of insulin-containing granules <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This acute phase of insulin secretion is followed by a second sustained phase driven by mitochondrial and cytosolic amplifying signals <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) attenuates insulin secretion by regulated uncoupling, which lowers the mitochondrial protonmotive force and the cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio. <italic>Ucp2</italic> knockout in mice <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> or its acute removal by siRNA knockdown in whole animals <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and beta-cell lines <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> improves GSIS, and overexpression of UCP2 in isolated islets <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> or whole animals <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> attenuates GSIS. UCP2 activity may coordinate the physiological response of beta-cells to fluctuating nutrient supply <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>UCP2 content in beta-cells is regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels. <italic>Ucp2</italic> gene expression is upregulated by hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, via transcription factors including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPAR-alpha <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and PPAR-gamma <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. Cold exposure, acting via sympathetic nerve stimulation and the PPAR-gamma coactivator PGC-1, can also increase <italic>Ucp2</italic> gene expression <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Repression of transcription, on the other hand, has been shown to involve sirtuins <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref> and interleukin IL-1-beta <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In other cell types, <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with protein concentrations <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, because of translational regulation. An upstream open reading frame inhibits translation of <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA, and inhibition can be overcome by glutamine <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. UCP2 can also be regulated at the functional level; it is activated by reactive oxygen species in beta-cell mitochondria <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and beta-cells <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and inhibited by purine nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Nothing is known about UCP2 protein degradation in beta-cells, although in ovarian and granulosa cell lines, the half-life of UCP2 is less than 1 h <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present paper we characterise the content and regulation of UCP2 in INS-1E insulinoma cells, a widely used clonal rat pancreatic beta-cell model. We show that UCP2 concentration varies 4–5-fold depending on the composition of the growth medium, because of translational and possibly transcriptional control. The half-life of UCP2 is about 1 h, allowing rapid and dynamic fluctuations in the UCP2 content of the cells in response to nutrients in the medium.</p>

        <title>Sample preparation</title>
        <p>All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich or Gibco unless stated otherwise. INS-1E cells were maintained in RPMI medium as described in <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For quantification of UCP2 protein and mRNA, Nunclon™ 500 cm<sup>2</sup> trays were seeded at 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml and grown to approximately 90% confluence. Following two washes with ice-cold SHE buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1% (w/v) defatted bovine serum albumin), cells were scraped off the trays and harvested by centrifugation at 350 <italic>g</italic> (10 min, 4 °C), then aliquots were made for cell UCP2 or mRNA quantification or mitochondrial isolation. Mitochondria were prepared from INS-1E cells as described in <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, either with or without a protease inhibitor cocktail.</p>
        <p>Mitochondria from rat and mouse tissues were isolated by standard methods. Female Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, UK) and <italic>Ucp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and wild-type sibling paired mice were 10–12 months old. <italic>Ucp2</italic> knockout was confirmed by PCR analysis of the <italic>Ucp2</italic> locus and immunoblotting. Animals were housed at 21 ± 2 °C, humidity 57 ± 5% with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Home Office Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (UK) were followed.</p>

        <title>Quantification of UCP2 protein</title>
        <p>Recombinant UCP2 (rUCP2) protein standards were prepared by subcloning, overexpression and purification of rat UCP2. cDNA containing the rat <italic>Ucp2</italic> gene was from imaGenes (Berlin, Germany). The complete UCP2 transcript was obtained by PCR using UCP2 forward (5′-CACCATGGTTGGTTTCAAGGCCACCGATGT-3′) and UCP2 reverse (5′-TCAAAAGGGTGCCTCCCGGGATTCATAGG-3′) primers. The transcript beginning CACC was subcloned into pET100/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) using the TOPO<sup>®</sup> cloning system according to the manufacturer's instructions. This plasmid added an N-terminal appendage (including a His<sub>6</sub>-tag) to the expressed protein. BL21 Star transformed with pET100/D-TOPO containing <italic>Ucp2</italic> were grown at 37 °C until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5. Expression was induced using 1 mM IPTG for 6 h. Inclusion bodies containing rUCP2 were isolated as described <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and solubilised in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 8 M urea and 25 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The sample was diluted 10-fold then purified using a HisTrap HP™ column (GE Healthcare, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of eluted protein was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and purity was assessed by SDS PAGE. SDS PAGE, immunoblotting and quantification of UCP2 in cells and mitochondria were performed as described in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Where appropriate, membranes were stripped (Restore™ Plus, Pierce) and reblotted for adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), or stained with Gelcode<sup>®</sup> Blue reagent (Pierce) to quantify protein. UCP2 (sc-6525) and ANT (sc-9300) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA.</p>

        <title>Dynamic variation of UCP2 content</title>
        <p>Characterisation of INS-1E cells has shown that they retain GSIS and a high degree of differentiation, making them a good model of pancreatic beta-cells <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Initial observations suggested that UCP2 content was high in INS-1E cells grown in standard RPMI medium, but much lower in cells incubated in simple salts medium for 90 min (C. Affourtit &amp; M.D. Brand, unpublished observations). To investigate why, we used immunoblotting calibrated with recombinant UCP2 standards to quantify UCP2 in cells and isolated mitochondria after incubation of cells in different media.</p>
        <p>Since INS-1E cells are derived from rat, we generated a rat recombinant UCP2 standard. Use of a rat standard was important for accurate quantification, as the antibody (anti-human UCP2) reacted about twice as strongly with recombinant human standards than rat standards (not shown). By Gelcode<sup>®</sup> Blue stain, rUCP2 in washed inclusion bodies was about 50% pure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A lane 2); this was increased to about 80% by using a HisTrap column (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A lane 1); the purity was taken into account in the calibrations. The specificity of the UCP2 antibody was verified by RNAi knockdown of UCP2 in INS-1E cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A lanes 3 and 4). rUCP2 was used on each immunoblot to generate an internal calibration curve. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B shows that the densitometry signal was proportional to the rUCP2 loaded; all measurements were made within the linear range shown.</p>
        <p>The UCP2 content of cells grown in standard RPMI medium, measured by calibrated immunoblot, was 2.0 ng/million cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, control bar). The UCP2 content of mitochondria isolated from the same cells was 7.9 ng/mg of mitochondrial protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, control bar). By division, the mitochondrial content of the cells was therefore 250 μg mitochondrial protein/million cells. Assuming a mitochondrial volume of 1 μl/mg protein and a cell volume of 2.4 μl/million cells (estimated from the mean diameter of trypsinised cells), mitochondria therefore comprise 11% of the volume of an INS-1E cell.</p>
        <p>Omission of glutamine from the medium resulted in decreases in UCP2 in cells and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B) without affecting <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The relative changes in UCP2 protein and <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D. Protein content changed significantly but mRNA did not, suggesting that UCP2 is translationally controlled by glutamine in INS-1E cells, in agreement with studies in other cells <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. Serum starvation had no effect on <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA, and although it consistently lowered UCP2 protein levels, implying translational control, this effect was not significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Lowering glucose to 2 mM had no effect on UCP2 protein or mRNA, but doubling glucose concentration to 20 mM increased protein levels 2-fold over control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), and affected mRNA in the same direction, although not significantly, suggesting transcriptional control of <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA by high glucose in INS-1E cells. This is explained by <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, where increased glucose was shown to transcriptionally activate <italic>Ucp2</italic> with a lack of reversibility of <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA levels when glucose in the medium is changed from a higher to a lower concentration.</p>
        <p>Between them, these interventions caused UCP2 concentrations to vary 4–5-fold in 24 h, from 1.0–4.4 ng/million cells (2.7–14.5 ng/mg mitochondrial protein). These mitochondrial concentrations are hundreds of times lower than UCP1 in brown adipose tissue, and 20-fold lower than UCP3 in skeletal muscle <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To compare them to UCP2 concentrations in other rat tissues, we analysed mitochondria from rat spleen, liver, kidney and pancreas. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A shows that the antibody detected UCP2 in spleen, kidney and pancreas mitochondria from wild-type mice and rats, but not in <italic>Ucp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B shows the values for rat mitochondria, quantified as before. Levels of UCP2 in INS-1E cells were similar to those in kidney and whole pancreas, and 20-fold lower than in spleen, previously reported to have the highest UCP2 levels of any tissue <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <title>UCP2 has a short half-life in INS-1E cells</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of protein degradation on the variation of UCP2 levels, INS-1E cells were treated with cycloheximide to arrest protein synthesis, and UCP2 levels were measured at different times by immunoblotting. UCP2 was found to have a short half-life of approximately 1 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, B), presumably allowing the dynamic fluctuations in UCP2 seen above and perhaps accounting for the low abundance of this protein. This short half-life contrasts with the much longer half-life of other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, such as UCP1 (see <xref rid="bib23 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[23,30]</xref>) and ANT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Furthermore, the half-life of UCP2 does not appear to be dependent on protein levels because doubling UCP2 content by incubation of INS-1E cells with 20 mM glucose had no effect on protein turnover, and expression of UCP1 and UCP2 in the same yeast system still gives a much longer half-life for UCP1 (30 h) than UCP2 (30 min) <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In contrast to whole cells, UCP2 levels were stable in isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C), implying that either the signal for degradation or degradation itself occurs outside the mitochondrion.</p>
        <p>Our work shows that owing to the short half-life (1 h) of UCP2, incubating cells in simple salt media can result in low UCP2 levels. This work may explain the variability of UCP2-mediated effects in different laboratories. Reassuringly, UCP2 is stable once mitochondria have been isolated.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>There is dynamic regulation of UCP2 concentration in INS-1E cells that is characterised by fast rates of synthesis and degradation. UCP2 synthesis is under translational and probably transcriptional control (as literature suggests for other cells <xref rid="bib19 bib20 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[19,20,28]</xref>), and its dynamic regulation is enabled by very rapid protein turnover. This highlights the dynamic response of UCP2 concentration and perhaps activity to changes in the nutrient supply, and sheds light on the ability of UCP2 to attenuate insulin secretion by uncoupling in INS-1E cells <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, beta-cells from pancreatic islets <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and whole animals <xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>.</p>

        <p>UCP2 standardisation. (A) Lanes 1 and 2: purified or unpurified inclusion body rUCP2. Purity was calculated from the intensity of the UCP2 band divided by the intensity of the whole lane. rUCP2 runs at a higher molecular weight than native UCP2 (lane 4) owing to its N-terminal appendage. Lanes 3 and 4: UCP2 antibody specificity as verified by immunoblotting INS-1E cells following treatment with siRNA against UCP2 or a scrambled siRNA control. (B) Linearity of calibration standards. rUCP2 standards were run on every gel (the immunoblot shows an example). After normalisation to the densitometry signal for 600 pg rUCP2, the densitometry signal was proportional to rUCP2 loaded. Values are means ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 12.</p>
