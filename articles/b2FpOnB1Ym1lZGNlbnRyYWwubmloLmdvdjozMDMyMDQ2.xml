        <p>In the present paper, gene expression analysis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells levitated in a novel ultrasound standing wave trap (USWT) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>) at variable acoustic pressures (0.08–0.85 MPa) and times (5–60 min) was performed. Our results showed that levitation of ES cells at the highest employed acoustic pressure for 60 min does not modify gene expression and cells maintain their pluripotency. Embryoid bodies (EBs) also expressed the early and late neural differentiation markers, which were also unaffected by the acoustic field. Our results suggest that the ultrasound trap microenvironment is minimally invasive as the biologic consequences of ES cell replication and EB differentiation proceed without significantly affecting gene expression. The technique holds great promise in safe cell manipulation techniques for a variety of applications including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

      <title>Introduction and Literature</title>
      <p>Cell manipulation techniques are important in many areas of research including cell biology, molecular genetics, biotechnological production, clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Physical methods of manipulating suspended cells at single-particle microscopic resolution include hydrodynamic (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. 2008</xref>), optical (<xref rid="bib24 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Mohanty et al. 2008; Bustamante et al. 2009</xref>), dielectrophoretic (<xref rid="bib14 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2009</xref>), magnetic (<xref rid="bib16 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Koschwanez et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009</xref>) and ultrasonic (<xref rid="bib3 bib12 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a; Evander et al. 2007; Oberti et al. 2007</xref>) cell trapping.</p>
      <p>Of the above mentioned methods, ultrasound trapping has been less extensively exploited. Compared with other methods, ultrasonic cell manipulation is an inexpensive noncontact technique that allows simultaneous and synchronous manipulation of a large number of cells in a very short time (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>). It is simple in both set-up and operation and is noninvasive, chemically inert (nontoxic) and physically nondestructive (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2004</xref>). Taking into account its high efficiency and reliability and the fact that it can be used with the majority of cell types, this technique holds great promise in cell manipulation techniques for a variety of applications.</p>
      <p>We have previously reported (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>) on a novel two-dimensional (2-D) ultrasound standing wave trap (USWT) capable of holding &gt;10,000 cells at the focal plane of a microscope. The USWT is an ultrasound resonator where the acoustic path-length in the cell suspension is a single half wavelength. The resonator has a pressure node plane half way through the cell suspension and parallel to the transducer (<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a, 2005b</xref>). The cell trap exploits the fact that cells experience an axial direct acoustic radiation force when in an ultrasound standing wave field (<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a, 2005b</xref>). This force drives them toward a node plane. They then move, within that plane, to accumulate at the centre of the field, <italic>i.e</italic>., at the nodal plane (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coakley et al. 2003</xref>). The USWT has been used to synchronously and rapidly (within 10 s of seconds) form and levitate 2-D (<xref rid="bib10 bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Coakley et al. 2003; Bazou et al. 2005a, 2005b</xref>) and three-dimensional (3-D) (<xref rid="bib18 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2007; Bazou et al. 2008</xref>) cell aggregates in suspension away from the influence of solid substrata. The technique has provided data on the intracellular temporal progression of F-actin formation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>) as well as on the gap junctional intercellular communication (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2006</xref>) in a large (ca. 10<sup>4</sup>) sample of cells.</p>
      <p>A frequently discussed matter in ultrasound trapping is the viability of trapped cells after being exposed to ultrasound. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nyborg (2001)</xref> reviewed the 80-year history of studies of biologic effects of ultrasound that had been conducted as there is great interest in applications of ultrasound to biotechnology and medical therapy. The need to assess the safety of the widespread medical applications of ultrasound was also highlighted (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nyborg 2001</xref>). He investigated the thermal effects that can arise because of sound absorption, effects due to cavitation as well as phenomena that arise due to acoustic radiation force or torque or acoustic streaming. In line with Nyborg’s review (2001), we have previously examined the physical environment of the USWT (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>). The results of the latter study, as well as those reported by <xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. (2005b, 2006, 2008</xref>) and <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al. (2007)</xref> showed that the ultrasound trap does not compromise cell behaviour or cell viability (cells remained 99% viable over 1 h of continuous levitation in the ultrasound trap), therefore, the standing wave operates only to concentrate cells locally as in tissue. However, data with regard to the effects of ultrasonic cell manipulation on gene expression profiles of cells has been limited to date.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate for the first time the influence of ultrasonic cell manipulation on key genes expressed during differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). ES cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> is a model for early embryonic development (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mansergh et al. 2009</xref>). During this developmental period, embryonic gene expression patterns may be liable to aberrant programming (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lonergan et al. 2006</xref>). Embryos can exhibit plasticity in their ability to adapt to suboptimal <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lonergan et al. 2006</xref>); however, their sensitivity to their environment can lead to long-term alterations in the characteristics of foetal and postnatal growth and development; it is thus important to investigate the effect (if any) of ultrasound in the context of early ES cell pluripotency and differentiation.</p>

        <title>Cell culture</title>
        <p>The IMT11 embryonic stem (ES) cell line, derived from 129Sv mice was used for all experiments described in this study. This cell line was a kind gift of Professor Sir Martin Evans (Cardiff University). This cell line was selected as it is not genetically modified and its gene expression profile has already been studied <italic>via</italic> microarray during expansion and early differentiation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mansergh et al. 2009</xref>). Undifferentiated ES cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on 0.1% gelatin in DMEM, with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin (all from Gibco; Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK), 10<sup>−4</sup> β-mercaproethanol (Merck kGaA; 64293 Darmstadt, Germany), 10<sup>−3</sup> U/mL murine LIF (ESGRO TM; Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK), 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% newborn bovine serum (NBS). For the generation of embryoid bodies (EBs) a semiconfluent 100 mm dish of ES cells was trypsinized (0.25% trypsin/EDTA, Invitrogen), followed by trituration in additional ES medium to achieve a single cell suspension. ES medium was prepared as above for + LIF EBs and without LIF for –LIF differentiations.</p>

        <title>Ultrasound trap</title>
        <p>The in-house constructed trap employed in the present work had four layers; a transducer (Ferroperm, Kvistgard, Denmark) nominally resonant in the thickness mode at 3 MHz and mounted in a radially symmetric housing, a steel layer coupling the ultrasound to a one half wavelength (λ/2 or 0.25 mm depth, where λ is the wavelength of sound in water at 3 MHz) aqueous layer and a quartz acoustic reflector that provided optical access from above (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>). The outer diameter of the cylindrical steel body was 35 mm. The “sample-containing” active area had a diameter of 18 mm. The disc transducer (12 mm diameter) was driven at 2.13 MHz. Its back electrode was etched to a 6 mm diameter circle so as to give a single central aggregate in a single half-wavelength chamber. The quartz glass acoustic reflector had a thickness of 0.5 mm (λ/4) so as to locate the single pressure node plane half way through the sample volume. The piezoceramic transducer was driven from a function generator (Hewlett Packard 33120A; Hewlett Packard, Berkshire, UK) to generate a mechanical wave.</p>

        <title>Optical system</title>
        <p>A fast, high-resolution XM10 (Soft Imaging System, SIS, GmbH, Munster, Germany) mounted on an Olympus BX51M reflection epi-fluorescence microscope allowed observation in the direction of sound propagation (negative z-axis) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005a</xref>). Images were captured by a standard PC equipped with the Cell-D image acquisition and processing software (Soft Imaging System, SIS, GmbH).</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2.4">
        <title>Experimental procedure</title>
        <p>Single cell suspensions of ES cells were prepared as described above and diluted to 3000 cells/μL. The ultrasound trap was placed into the tissue culture cabinet to ensure sterility of the samples. A stereo-microscope (Swift Instruments International, San Jose, CA, USA), on which the ultrasound trap was placed, was also inserted into the tissue culture cabinet to monitor the aggregate growth process. Cell suspensions were introduced into the trap (pre-coated with gelatin to inhibit any cell-substratum interactions) at room temperature with a sterile 2 mL syringe (Plastipak, Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). The acoustic field was initiated and aggregates were allowed to form. Two sets of samples were generated.</p>
        <p>The first set of samples was levitated in the trap at 0.08 MPa (the minimal pressure at which aggregates remained levitated in suspension) and 0.85 MPa (the maximum pressure achieved with the current experimental set-up) for 5 min to determine whether the acoustic pressure affects gene expression. The trap was driven at its resonance frequency of 2.14 MHz. Experimental treatments included: (1) control (C) (cells not introduced into the trap-untreated), (2) control trap (CT) (cells were introduced into the trap but the ultrasonic field was off), (3) low acoustic pressure (L) (cells were levitated in the trap at 0.08 MPa) and (4) high acoustic pressure (H) (cells were levitated in the trap at 0.85 MPa).</p>
        <p>In the second set of samples, the acoustic pressure was kept constant at 0.85 MPa, while the time of levitation varied between 5 and 60 min, to examine whether long periods of levitation in the trap at the highest acoustic pressure affects gene expression. The trap was again driven at its resonance frequency of 2.14 MHz. Experimental treatments were as follows: (1) control (C) (cells were not introduced into the trap-untreated), (2) control trap 5 min (CT5) (cells were introduced into the trap while the ultrasonic field was off for 5 min), (3) control trap 60 min (CT60) (cells were introduced into the trap while the ultrasound field was off for 60 min), (4) ultrasound 5 min (US5) (cells were levitated in the trap at 0.85 MPa for 5 min) and (5) ultrasound 60 min (US60) (cells were levitated in the trap at 0.85 MPa for 60 min).</p>
        <p>The ultrasound field was subsequently switched off and aggregates were slowly recovered from the trap with a syringe. They were then dispersed back into single cell suspensions (as excessive aggregation results in spontaneous differentiation) and maintained, as appropriate for ES and EBs, in culture until they reached 70% to 80% confluence prior to further analysis. Specifically, one batch of the ultrasound levitated ES cells was plated in gelatin-coated Petri dishes for proliferation, whereas the second batch of ES cells was plated in nonadherent bacterial Petri dishes without LIF for differentiation. This involves nonadherent ES cells aggregating randomly and forming EBs of different sizes spontaneously in culture. EBs were fed every 2 days and cultured for 4 days (D4 EBs) in the absence of LIF. Retinoic acid (RA), as specified by <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bibel et al. (2007)</xref> was then added to induce early neural differentiation (<xref rid="bib2 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bain et al. 1995; Bibel et al. 2007</xref>) and cells were maintained in culture for an additional 4 days (D8 EBs). All experiments were repeated three times (three replicates/set of experiment, <italic>i.e</italic>., a total of nine samples were overall assessed) and representative data are presented, unless otherwise stated.</p>

        <title>Karyotype analysis</title>
        <p>Karyotype analysis was performed on the ES cell samples: C, CT, L and H to examine whether the acoustic pressure affects chromosomal stability. Analysis was performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Mansergh et al. 2005</xref>). Scoring of cells with chromosome numbers varying between &lt;39 and &gt;41 was then performed through microscopic observations. The number of cells with 40 chromosomes was divided to the total number of cells in at least five randomly selected fields of view.</p>

        <title>Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription</title>
        <p>Cells were rinsed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 1 mL of Tri reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK). The TRI Reagent was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma Aldrich) for RNA extraction, followed by OD 260/280 spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Samples were DNase treated using the DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as per manufacturer’s instructions and subsequently reversed transcribed using the random hexamer protocol of the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). RT reactions were diluted with nuclease free water (Ambion) to 100 μL before polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. A “no RT” control corresponding to each sample was also produced for all RT-PCR experiments; these were treated in exactly the same way as the samples except that reverse transcriptase was not added.</p>

The following samples were tested: ES cells (C, CT5, CT60, US5, US60) and EBs (C, CT, L, H at days 4 and 8). qPCRs were carried out in 20 μL volumes using 10 μL of 2× QuantiTect SYBR green PCR master mix, 10 pmol/μL of each primer set and 25 ng cDNA per reaction.

All data presented here have been normalised with respect to the CT treatment to rule out an effect of the ultrasound trap itself on gene expression, as cells subjected to CT, L and H treatments have all undergone the same preparation and introduction into the ultrasound trap processes.</p>

      <title>Discussion and Summary</title>
      <p>There is strong evidence that the behaviour of stem cells is strongly affected by their local environment or niche (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Watt and Driskell 2010</xref>). Some aspects of the stem cell environment that are known to influence self-renewal and stem cell fate are: adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, direct contact with neighbouring cells, exposure to secreted factors and physical factors (such as oxygen concentration and shear stress) (<xref rid="bib30 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Watt and Hogan 2000; Morrison and Spradling 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The environment to which the mammalian embryo is exposed during the pre-implantation period of development has a profound effect on the physiology and viability of the conceptus (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gardner and Lane 2005</xref>). It has been demonstrated that conditions that alter gene expression can also adversely affect cell physiology. It is therefore important to examine the factors contributing to abnormal gene expression and altered imprinting patterns, and whether problems can be arrested by using more physiologic culture conditions (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gardner and Lane 2005</xref>). It is also of note that the sensitivity of the embryo to its surroundings decreases as development proceeds. Post compaction and environmental conditions have a lesser effect on gene function as development proceeds. Therefore, we undertook the present study to examine whether the employed ultrasound trap microenvironment does affect stem cell expansion and differentiation, and thus whether ultrasound cell manipulation affects the gene expression profile of stem cells.</p>
      <sec id="sec4.1">
        <title>Effect of acoustic pressure on ES cell and EB gene expression</title>
        <p>Our results (<xref rid="fig1 fig2 fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1–3</xref>) show that, with the exception of <italic>Mash1</italic>, the gene expression profile of ES cells and EBs was not influenced following levitation of cells at the highest employed acoustic pressure (0.85 MPa). Furthermore, no effect on stem cell karyotype was observed (data not shown).</p>
        <p>We have previously calculated that the attractive acoustic force between ultrasonically agglomerated cells of 10 μm diameter equals the van der Waals force at surface separations of 34 nm (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coakley et al. 2003</xref>) when the pressure amplitude is 0.25 MPa in a 1.5 MHz trap. For the 14 μm diameter, ES cells examined in the present study the acoustic force at a pressure amplitude of 0.85 MPa (H), equals the van der Waals force at a surface separation of 43 nm. This distance is greater than the range of surface receptor molecules. At smaller separations, the van der Waals force dominates the essentially constant acoustic force. When the pressure amplitude is reduced to 0.08 MPa (L) during aggregate levitation, the acoustic interaction is less than the van der Waals force at separations less than 237 nm and is negligible at the surface separation at which receptors operate. Therefore, any gene expression change would be most likely attributed to cell-cell interactions rather than to any “stress” imposed on cells levitated in the trap at the highest acoustic pressure.</p>
        <p>However, <italic>Mash1</italic> was the only gene out of the 16 genes examined, found to be differentially regulated (though statistically marginally different <italic>p</italic> 0.0409 &lt; 0.05), in D4 EBs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b) but not in D8 EBs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). More specifically, the expression of this gene was upregulated with increasing acoustic pressure, while in the CT and C treatments its expression was at its lowest. As levitation of ES cells at the highest acoustic pressure for 60 min had no effect on the expression of the pluripotency genes (<xref rid="fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 and 5</xref>), we suggest that inherent differences between ES cells and EBs might account for the upregulation of the <italic>Mash 1</italic> gene instead of any direct effect of the acoustic field. ES cells are cultured in a planar format (monolayer, 2-D architecture) and are thus provided with a more defined substrate for their attachment and uniform exposure to soluble media components (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bratt-Leal et al. 2009</xref>). EBs on the other hand, are of a 3-D architecture whereas their size, shape and homogeneity varies even between EBs of the same culture while they are highly sensitive to soluble media components (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mansergh et al. 2009</xref>); consequently, their culture conditions and environment are not as defined as those of ES cells. Furthermore, as reported by <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mansergh et al. (2009)</xref>, there is large variability between batches of EBs and indeed between individual EBs themselves, thus reasoning the statistically marginal upregulation of <italic>Mash1</italic> expression in D4 EBs.</p>

        <title>Effect of duration of ultrasonic levitation on ES cell gene expression</title>
        <p>The gene expression profile of ES cells levitated in the ultrasound trap at an acoustic pressure of 0.85 MPa for 5 and 60 min is shown in <xref rid="fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 4 and 5</xref>. No significant difference in the expression of the three pluripotency genes Nanog, Oct4 and Rex1 was observed between the treatments.</p>
        <p>We decided to set 60 min as the maximum time period of levitation as: (1) this time period has been the maximum one employed by us previously (<xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2005b, 2006</xref>) and (2) cell-cell interactions have been shown to have reached their equilibrium state through expression of cell membrane surface receptors (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bazou et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our Western blotting data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) showed that the amount of protein expressed by ES cells is not affected by 60 min levitation in the trap at 0.85 MPa (<italic>p</italic> = 0.936 and 0.931 for Nanog and Oct4, respectively). We note that we selected two (Nanog and Oct4) of the three pluripotency genes as a good indication of their expression at the protein level. In concurrence, immunofluorescence analysis revealed high expression of Nanog and Oct4 at all experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), indicating that the undifferentiated status of ES cells was preserved and remained unaffected by the ultrasound trap microenvironment. Nanog and Oct4 proteins were found present in almost (99%) all single cells as well as in the EBs (data not shown). The pluripotency of ES cells is maintained through continuous high expression of Oct4 and Nanog <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib20 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loh et al. 2006; Niwa 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arzumanyan et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the results presented in this study suggest that ultrasonic cell manipulation is a minimally invasive technique where gene expression of mouse ES cells remains unaffected. ES cells within the ultrasound trap microenvironment maintain their pluripotency, while EBs expressed a range of early and late neural differentiation markers. We acknowledge that in the present study a particular cohort of genes was investigated, thus, a cDNA microarray analysis would be the next sensible step. The ultrasound trap acts in a passive manner to concentrate cells locally, while the biologic consequences of ES cell replication and EB differentiation proceeded without affecting expression of the genes examined. As operational conditions are similar to those employed during medical ultrasonography, this study provides further evidence toward the biosafety of ultrasound.</p>
