      <abstract>
        <p>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the vasculature that is orchestrated by the action of cytokines. Macrophages play a prominent role in all stages of this disease, including foam cell formation, production of reactive oxygen species, modulation of the inflammatory response and the regulation of the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. The role of the matrix metalloproteinase family in the control of plaque stability is well established. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family has been implicated in several diseases and the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions has suggested a potential role for this protease in atherosclerosis. However, the action of cytokines on the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages is poorly understood. We have investigated here the effect of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) on ADAMTS-4 expression in macrophages along with the regulatory mechanisms underlying its actions. Consistent with the anti-atherogenic role of TGF-β, this cytokine decreased the expression of ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein in human macrophages. Transient transfection assays showed that the −100 to +10 promoter region contained the minimal TGF-β response elements. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown revealed a critical role for Smads, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun in the action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression. These studies show for the first time that TGF-β inhibits the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human macrophages and identifies the signalling pathways underlying this response. The inhibition of macrophage ADAMTS-4 expression is likely to contribute to the anti-atherogenic, plaque stabilisation action of TGF-β.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) proteases are non-membrane bound enzymes that are able to interact with and degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as pro-collagen and hyalectans (<xref rid="bib0140 bib0060 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010; Jones and Riley, 2005; Porter et al., 2005</xref>). Of the ADAMTS proteases identified to date, ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 are the most abundant and consequently have been the subject of the majority of research on these enzymes (<xref rid="bib0140 bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010; Jones and Riley, 2005</xref>). There has been much focus on the ability of ADAMTS proteases to cleave aggrecan, a proteoglycan present in articular cartilage (<xref rid="bib0140 bib0115 bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010; Naito et al., 2007; Tang, 2001</xref>). Cleavage of aggrecan in human cartilage contributes to the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and a role for ADAMTS-4 in this process has been defined (<xref rid="bib0140 bib0115 bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010; Naito et al., 2007; Tang, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>A possible role for the ADAMTS proteases as contributors to inflammation and atherosclerosis has only recently come to light (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010</xref>). Atherosclerosis, the primary cause of coronary heart disease, is an inflammatory disorder orchestrated by the action of cytokines. The latter stages of this disease are associated with the migration and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which leads to the production of the extracellular matrix and the formation of a fibrous cap in the atherosclerotic plaque (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2009</xref>). The balance between the synthesis and the degradation of the ECM by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases determines the susceptibility of the plaque to rupture and subsequent thrombosis and myocardial infarction (<xref rid="bib0085 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Li and Glass, 2002; Lusis et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The ADAMTS proteases were first associated with inflammation when it was shown that administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <italic>in vivo</italic> could enhance ADAMTS-1 expression in the heart and in the kidneys (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Kuno et al., 1997</xref>). ADAMTS-1, -4 and -8 have been found to be present within atherosclerotic lesions and mice overexpressing ADAMTS-1 crossed with ApoE-deficient mice, an animal model for atherosclerosis, showed increased thickening of the arterial intima (<xref rid="bib0205 bib0065 bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wight, 2005; Jonsson-Rylander et al., 2005; Wågsäter et al., 2008</xref>). ADAMTS-4 is predominantly associated with macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions and its expression is increased following both monocyte–macrophage differentiation and during development of atherosclerosis in a mouse model system (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wågsäter et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of the ADAMTS proteases to cleave proteoglycans is likely to be central to any proposed role in atherosclerosis. Both ADAMTS-1 and -4 are able to cleave versican, a proteoglycan similar in structure to aggrecan but predominantly expressed in the vasculature (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Sandy et al., 2001</xref>). Versican expression is upregulated in vascular disease, accumulates in atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Worley et al., 2003</xref>) and can be cleaved by ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 at specific Glu-Ala bonds (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Sandy et al., 2001</xref>). It has also been shown that in the human aorta, versican fragments can be generated by ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 digestion of intact human versican (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Sandy et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Very few studies have investigated the regulation of ADAMTS protease expression in macrophages and further studies are necessary especially as ADAMTS-4 has been found to colocalize with macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wågsäter et al., 2008</xref>). To our knowledge only one study has been carried out that investigated the expression of ADAMTS proteases in response to cytokines in human macrophages and this demonstrated that ADAMTS-4 expression was up-regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wågsäter et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>TGF-β is a major anti-atherogenic cytokine and inhibition of its actions, using neutralising antibodies or expression of a dominant negative receptor, has been found to accelerate the development of atherosclerosis in mouse models of this disease (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2006a</xref>). The cytokine inhibits foam cell formation and an inverse relationship has been identified between circulating levels of TGF-β and the development of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2006a</xref>). In addition, regions in the aorta with low TGF-β expression have a high probability of developing atherosclerosis (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2006a</xref>). TGF-β is also known to inhibit the expression of MMPs, which decrease plaque stability via thinning of the fibrous plaque through cleavage of collagens, elastins and other proteoglycans in the ECM (<xref rid="bib0040 bib0150 bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Galis and Khatri, 2002; Singh and Ramji, 2006a; Newby, 2007</xref>). In light of such a potent anti-atherogenic role of TGF-β, we examined its action on ADAMTS-4 expression in human macrophages with a view to further investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation. We show here that TGF-β down-regulates ADAMTS-4 expression at the level of mRNA, protein and promoter activity. In addition, our studies demonstrate a critical role for Smads, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun in the regulation of ADAMTS-4 by TGF-β.</p>

        <title>TGF-β inhibits ADAMTS-4 expression at the mRNA and protein level in THP-1 macrophages and HMDMs</title>
        <p>The action of TGF-β on the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human macrophages has not been determined and was therefore investigated. The THP-1 monocytic cell line, which can be differentiated into macrophages using PMA, is used extensively to investigate macrophage gene expression in relation to atherosclerosis because of demonstrated conservation of responses with primary macrophage cultures, in particular gene regulation by cytokines (<xref rid="bib0010 bib0100 bib0105 bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Auwerx, 1991; McLaren et al., 2010a,b; Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our previous studies on the TGF-β-mediated activation of apolipoprotein E expression showed maximal response at 24 h with 30 ng/ml of the cytokine (<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2006b</xref>). We therefore carried out dose–response RT-qPCR experiments on ADAMTS-4 using the 24 h incubation period. As shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, a marked inhibition of ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression was observed with 2 ng/ml TGF-β with maximal suppression using 30 ng/ml of this cytokine. Further time course experiments using 30 ng/ml of the cytokine showed that ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression was down-regulated by TGF-β within 1 h of treatment and this response was sustained over the 24 h time period. Subsequent experiments were carried out using 30 ng/ml of TGF-β for an incubation period of 24 h, unless otherwise stated.</p>
        <p>To determine whether this down-regulation was accompanied by a corresponding change in the level of protein, the expression of ADAMTS-4 was investigated using Western blot analysis. Preliminary experiments showed that the expression of ADAMTS-4 protein was decreased with delayed kinetics compared to RNA (data not shown) so longer incubation periods were used for Western blot analysis. <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A shows that ADAMTS-4 protein expression was significantly down-regulated in THP-1 macrophages by TGF-β treatment. In the light of these results and to confirm that the TGF-β-mediated decrease in ADAMTS-4 expression was not peculiar to the THP-1 cell line, we decided to carry out representative experiments in primary cultures of HMDMs. For this, the action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 protein expression was determined. <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B shows that protein expression of ADAMTS-4 was down-regulated by TGF-β in these primary cultures.</p>

        <title>TGF-β inhibits ADAMTS-4 promoter activity</title>
        <p>In order to investigate whether the action of TGF-β was mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level through the regulation of promoter activity, the effect of this cytokine on ADAMTS-4 promoter activity in transfected cells was determined. Because of difficulties in transfecting the THP-1 cell line with exogenous DNA, most experiments were carried out using the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line. These cells are used extensively to investigate the regulation of gene expression by cytokines in relation to inflammation (acute-phase response) with demonstrated conservation of responses to primary cultures (<xref rid="bib0025 bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Foka et al., 2003, 2009</xref> and references therein). Western blot analysis showed that TGF-β also inhibits ADAMTS-4 expression in these cells (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), thereby showing that the response was also conserved in hepatocytes. The 48 h time point was chosen for experiments in these cells as it corresponded to maximal decrease in ADAMTS-4 expression as identified by preliminary time course analysis (data not shown).</p>
        <p>We employed four promoter deletion constructs linked to the luciferase gene: −726/+406 (p1132-LUC); −383/+406 (p789-LUC); −100/+406 (p506-LUC); and +11/+406 (p396-LUC) (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Mizui et al., 2000</xref>). A TGF-β-mediated decrease in promoter activity was obtained with the p1132-LUC, p789-LUC and p-506-LUC constructs but not with the p-396-LUC construct (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). This suggests that the minimal TGF-β response elements reside between the −100 and the +10 region. Similar results were obtained when representative experiments were carried out using human U937 macrophages (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C) [the luciferase reporter gene activity from the +11/+406 (p396-LUC) construct in these cells was negligible and was therefore not included for further analysis].</p>

        <title>The action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 expression requires Smads, p38 MAPK and c-Jun</title>
        <p>TGF-β mediates many of its actions through the classical Smad signalling pathway with the three MAPK pathways [ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK] required in the regulation of certain genes (<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Ten Dijke and Hill, 2004</xref>). Most of these studies have been carried out in relation to the TGF-β-mediated induction of gene expression and very little is currently understood in relation to the inhibition of gene expression. We therefore analysed whether the Smad or MAPK pathways had any role in the regulation of ADAMTS-4 expression by this cytokine. This was investigated using siRNA-mediated RNA interference assays and RT-qPCR analysis. As in a number of previous studies, GAPDH siRNA was used as a control (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2010</xref>) and this had no effect on the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS-4 expression (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Knockdown of Smad-2 plus 3, ERK 1/2, c-Jun, a key downstream target of the JNK pathway, and p38 MAPK was achieved using commercially validated siRNA sequences and relative expression of each protein following siRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed in THP-1 macrophages by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). The TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS-4 expression was attenuated by knockdown of Smad-2 plus -3 (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). In addition, the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS-4 expression was attenuated by knockdown of c-Jun and p38 MAPK but not ERK1/2 (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Because the expression of ADAMTS-4 is induced during monocyte–macrophage differentiation (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wågsäter et al., 2008</xref>), the effect of these knockdown on the constitutive expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages, driven by the differentiation process, was also determined. This was inhibited by knockdown of only p38 MAPK but not Smad-2 plus -3, ERK1/2 or c-Jun (<xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several members of the ADAMTS family have been linked with inflammation but their role in this and in pathophysiological inflammatory states including atherosclerosis is only beginning to be researched (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010</xref>). Although the exact role of the ADAMTS proteases in atherosclerosis remains unclear it is thought that the ability of ADAMTS-1 and -4 to cleave versican, the primary proteoglycan component of the vasculature, is likely to be central to any hypothesised role in the disease (<xref rid="bib0140 bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al., 2010; Worley et al., 2003</xref>). The production and secretion of proteases by smooth muscle cells and by macrophages is a key regulatory action during atherosclerosis (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2009</xref>). The vulnerability of the atherosclerotic plaque is determined by the balance between the synthesis and the degradation of the ECM. This degradation is achieved through the action of MMPs and other proteases such as the ADAMTS proteases, which cleave the collagens and proteoglycans of the ECM (<xref rid="bib0040 bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Galis and Khatri, 2002; Newby, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>We demonstrate for the first time that ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein expression is inhibited by the anti-atherogenic cytokine TGF-β in THP-1 macrophages and HMDMs (<xref rid="fig0005 fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 and 2</xref>). The response is also conserved in hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This novel finding is consistent with the work of <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Wågsäter et al. (2008)</xref> who found that ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression can be up-regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages. In addition to this, TGF-β has been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of a number of MMPs, including MMP-1 (<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2000</xref>), MMP-3 (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Kerr et al., 1990</xref>) and MMP-9 (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). In our studies, down-regulation of ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression by TGF-β was observed within 1 h and continued up to 24 h of treatment with this cytokine (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to characterising the response of ADAMTS-4 to TGF-β, we also identify the regulatory region of the ADAMTS-4 promoter involved in this response. We show here that ADAMTS-4 promoter activity was suppressed by TGF-β treatment (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Transient transfection of ADAMTS-4 promoter deletion constructs demonstrates an involvement of the −100/+10 region in the negative regulation of the ADAMTS-4 promoter by TGF-β (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Of the ADAMTS proteases, only the promoters of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 have been characterised (<xref rid="bib0110 bib0175 bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Mizui et al., 2000; Thirunavukkarasu et al., 2006, 2007</xref>). <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Mizui et al. (2000)</xref> have identified the −383 to +10 sequence of the ADAMTS-4 promoter as the region required for full promoter activity. In addition, analysis of the promoter activity of various deletion constructs suggested that the region between −726 and −384 was likely to contain silencer elements (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Mizui et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also show that the Smad pathway is required in the action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 expression. The Smads are the classical transducers of the TGF-β signal (<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Ross and Hill, 2008</xref>) and Smad-2, -3 and -4 are expressed in macrophages and foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Kalinina et al., 2004</xref>). Following siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad-2 plus -3, the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression was no longer significant (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Smads have been implicated in the repression of a number of genes by TGF-β including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, involved in the recruitment of monocytes in inflammatory vascular disease states (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Feinberg et al., 2004</xref>), and the scavenger receptor CD36, which has been shown to be regulated by a reduction in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activity mediated by TGF-β through Smad-3 and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, our data suggest an involvement of MAPKs as the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS-4 was no longer significant following siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAPK and c-Jun (a key downstream target for JNK pathway) (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, the ERK pathway was not involved (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). TGF-β is able to activate the MAPK pathways (<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Ten Dijke and Hill, 2004</xref>) but whether this acts independently or in conjunction with the classical Smad pathway is unclear. Smads have been shown to interact with the c-Jun and c-fos proteins, components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Verrecchia and Mauviel, 2002</xref>), and the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of MMP-1 expression has been shown to be dependent on the interaction between Smads and the AP-1 site present within the MMP-1 promoter (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several cytokines are present in atherosclerotic lesions and the action of combinations of cytokines on gene expression and cellular changes is likely to be more profound than that produced by a single cytokine. For example, our previous studies have shown that there is a synergism between IFN-γ and TNF-α in the regulation of macrophage lipoprotein lipase gene expression (<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Tengku-Muhammad et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, IFN-γ antagonises the action of TGF-β (<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Ulloa et al., 1999</xref>). Future studies should therefore investigate the action of combinations of cytokines on ADAMTS-4 expression.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that ADAMTS-4 is negatively regulated by TGF-β in human macrophages and that this regulation requires Smads, p38 MAPK and c-Jun. We have identified the minimal regulatory promoter region involved in this response. These findings are likely to be important for atherosclerosis given the potent anti-atherogenic action of TGF-β, as demonstrated by numerous studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the demonstrated crucial role of proteases in the regulation of plaque stability. It is therefore essential that the role of ADAMTS-4 in the regulation of atherosclerosis in mouse model systems is determined.</p>

THP-1 macrophages were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentration of TGF-β (A) or with 30 ng/ml of this cytokine for the time points shown (B). Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR. The Ct method was used for analysis and the values for ADAMTS-4 were normalised to the control gene GAPDH (A) or RPL13A (B).

        <p>The effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of key components of the TGF-β signalling pathway on the inhibition of ADAMTS-4 expression by this cytokine. THP-1 monocytes were transfected with validated siRNA against Smad-2 and -3, ERK 1/2, c-Jun or p38 MAPK as shown. Cells were incubated with siRNA for 24 h before differentiation for 24 h with PMA and subsequently being either left untreated (UT) or stimulated with 30 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. Total RNA and protein was then purified. (A) siRNA-mediated knockdown was verified by Western blot analysis using antisera against total Smad-2 and -3, ERK 1/2, c-Jun, p38 MAPK (p38) and β-actin, as indicated. The image shown is representative of three independent experiments. The histogram shows relative expression (mean ± SD) of each protein normalised to β-actin, as determined by densitometric analysis, with the values from GAPDH siRNA-transfected cells being arbitrarily assigned as 1 (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). (B) Total RNA was subjected to RT-qPCR and the ADAMTS-4 expression was normalised to the control gene RPL13A and presented as the fold change relative to the untreated sample for each siRNA, which was arbitrarily assigned as 1.
