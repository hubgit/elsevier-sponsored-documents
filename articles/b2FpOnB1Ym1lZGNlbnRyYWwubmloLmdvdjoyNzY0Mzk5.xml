        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>We report for the first time abnormalities in cardiac ventricular electrophysiology in a genetically modified murine model lacking the <italic>Scn3b</italic> gene (<italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup>). <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were created by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA was expressed in the ventricles of wild-type (WT) hearts but was absent in the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. These hearts also showed increased expression levels of <italic>Scn1b</italic> mRNA in both ventricles and <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA in the right ventricles compared to findings in WT hearts. <italic>Scn1b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the left than in the right ventricles of both <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and WT hearts. Bipolar electrogram and monophasic action potential recordings from the ventricles of Langendorff-perfused <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated significantly shorter ventricular effective refractory periods (VERPs), larger ratios of electrogram duration obtained at the shortest and longest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> intervals, and ventricular tachycardias (VTs) induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Such arrhythmogenesis took the form of either monomorphic or polymorphic VT. Despite shorter action potential durations (APDs) in both the endocardium and epicardium, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed ΔAPD<sub>90</sub> values that remained similar to those shown in WT hearts. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique applied to ventricular myocytes isolated from <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated reduced peak Na<sup>+</sup> current densities and inactivation curves that were shifted in the negative direction, relative to those shown in WT myocytes. Together, these findings associate the lack of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> gene with arrhythmic tendencies in intact perfused hearts and electrophysiological features similar to those in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> hearts.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channels, critical for the excitation of cardiac muscle (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keating and Sanguinetti, 2001</xref>), are formed of pore-forming <italic>α</italic>-subunits and one or more <italic>β</italic>-subunits (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Isom, 2001</xref>). Experiments using the two-electrode voltage clamp in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes demonstrated that the <italic>α</italic>-subunits alone can form functional Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Noda et al., 1986</xref>). Thus far nine <italic>α</italic>-subunits, Na<sub>v</sub>1.1–Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 are each encoded by different genes and have been identified and cloned in mammals. Mutations in <italic>SCN5A</italic> which encodes for the cardiac <italic>α</italic>-subunit, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, can result in arrhythmic conditions, including the Brugada (BrS) and Long QT syndrome (LQTS) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, the electrophysiological roles of <italic>β</italic>-subunits in the function of cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channels are less well understood. Six <italic>β</italic>-subunits have been identified and are encoded by 4 different genes; <italic>SCN1B</italic>, <italic>SCN2B</italic>, <italic>SCN3B</italic> and <italic>SCN4B</italic> (<xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib21 bib35 bib40 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1992, 1995a; Kazen-Gillespie et al., 2000; Morgan et al., 2000; Qin et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003</xref>). These genes, which encode for <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub> subunits respectively, are expressed in human tissues including the brain, skeletal muscle and the heart (<xref rid="bib5 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Candenas et al., 2006; Stevens et al., 2001</xref>). Of these, the <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits have been demonstrated in the transverse tubules, and <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub> subunits in the intercalated disks of murine ventricular myocytes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Maier et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is possible that the presence of <italic>β</italic>-subunits can affect both the function and expression of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel. Firstly, studies in heterologous expression systems provided by <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells demonstrated that <italic>β</italic>-subunits modify gating kinetics, including activation, inactivation and the recovery from inactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref rid="bib8 bib33 bib35 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2002; Meadows et al., 2002; Morgan et al., 2000; Patton et al., 1994</xref>). However, these alterations vary with the particular cell types used to express the Na<sup>+</sup> channel subunits (<xref rid="bib20 bib35 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995b; Morgan et al., 2000; Qu et al., 2001</xref>). Secondly, these subunits can also alter the Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitude (<xref rid="bib12 bib28 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Fahmi et al., 2001; Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). Thirdly, <italic>β</italic>-subunits contain domains that are structurally homologous to the V-set of the Ig superfamily, which includes cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995a</xref>). This permits cell–cell interaction and adhesion in cells expressing these subunits (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Malhotra et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, the <italic>β</italic>-subunits have been shown to regulate the expression density of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel in the plasma membrane. Experiments using CHO and 1610 cell lines have demonstrated a 2- to 4-fold greater Na<sup>+</sup> channel expression when <italic>α</italic>-subunits were co-expressed with <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> subunits, than when these were expressed alone (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995b</xref>).</p>
      <p>The presence or absence of <italic>β</italic>-subunits has recently been associated with electrophysiological abnormalities in cardiac tissue. Surface electrocardiogram experiments carried out on genetically modified mice, lacking the <italic>Scn1b</italic> gene, have demonstrated a LQT-like phenotype, characterised by a prolonged QT interval (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007</xref>). However, only two clinical reports thus far have associated mutations in the gene <italic>SCN4B</italic> with LQTS (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Medeiros-Domingo et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>SCN1B</italic>, encoding both <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>1B</sub> subunits with BrS (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, we assessed, for the first time, electrophysiological properties in the ventricles of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts compared to those shown in WT hearts. Firstly, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were created using homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The phenotype of the resulting <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, including body weight and temperature, appeared similar to that of WT mice. Secondly, ventricles of such mice showed altered expression levels of <italic>Scn3b</italic>, <italic>Scn1b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA. Thirdly, studies in Langendorff-perfused <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated arrhythmogenic features. Finally, these corresponded to changes in the biophysical properties of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel, with features similar to those previously reported in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> hearts (<xref rid="bib38 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Papadatos et al., 2002; Stokoe et al., 2007a</xref>).</p>

        <title>Generation of Scn3b-deficient (−/−) mice</title>
        <p>PCR amplification was used to generate homologous arms from the 129SvEv mouse genome, using primers designed to amplify a 5′ arm spanning 2.0 kb of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> locus terminating downstream of the third coding exon splice acceptor (5′armF; tttgcggccgCAGCCTTGTATGAACCCAGGGTCTTTC and 5′armR; tttactagtCACCTCCTGGTGGCCATTTCGATACTC) and a 3′ arm spanning 4.1 kb of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> locus commencing just upstream of the third coding exon splice donor (3′armF; tttggcgcgccGGTAAGCCTGAGGCCTGTAGTCTCTTC and 3′armR; tttggccggccGTGGACTTTAGTCCCATGTCCTCATTG).</p>
        <p>The arms were cloned into the plasmid pTK5IBLMNL (Paradigm Therapeutics Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.) using the restriction sites incorporated in the arm primers, such that the 5′ and 3′ arms flank an IRES-fronted <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene followed by a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked PGKNeopA selectable marker. After homologous recombination, 191 bp of the 226 bp third coding exon is replaced by the IRES<italic>LacZ</italic>/PGKneo cassette. Putative targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells were identified by PCR using an external 5′ screening primer (5′scr: CTGACATCTTCTCAGCAGATAACTGAC) in combination with a vector specific primer (DR2; ATCATGGCCCTACCATGCGCTAAACAC). Successfully targeted ES cells were further confirmed by Southern blot of <italic>Afl</italic>II and <italic>Bcl</italic>I digested genomic DNA, using an external probe amplified from a genomic region downstream of the end of the 3′ arm (using the primers 3′prF; AGATGTCCAGCGATACTGTTGAGGCAG and 3′prR; TGTGAGTCTTATTGGAGGTACAGTGTG), indicating that the integration had occurred legitimately.</p>
        <p>Correctly targeted 129 SvEv ES cells, containing the <italic>Scn3b</italic> knockout (KO) allele were injected into host blastocysts as previously described (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 1984</xref>), generating male chimeras which were subsequently mated with 129 SvEv females. Pups from these crosses were screened with the original target screening PCR (using 5′scr and vector specific primer, DR2), to identify heterozygote animals and in further generations by a multiplex PCR designed to amplify a 204 bp region specific to the WT allele and a 334 bp region specific to the <italic>Scn3b</italic> KO allele. This allowed differentiation of each of the three possible genotypes (using primers hetF, GTCGTCTGCAGTGGAATGGGAGCAAAG; hetR, TGAAGAGACTACAGGCCTCAGGCTTAC; and Asc306, AATGGCCGCTTTTCTGGATTCATCGAC). All genotypes were observed at the expected Mendelian ratios. Routinely homozygous matings were established to produce the experimental cohorts and 129SvEv stock used as the WT controls. Male and female offspring of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were randomly selected for use in all experiments. Mice obtained were kept in cages at a room temperature of 21 ± 1 °C in an animal facility with 12-hour light/dark cycles. The mice had free access to sterile rodent chow and water.</p>
        <p>A series of tests were used to assess baseline metabolic and behavioural parameters and were performed on cohorts of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Each cohort typically consisted of 5–8 mice of either sex at the age of 3–4 months. The metabolic tests included measuring the body weight and temperature. Each mouse was weighed monthly for up to 3 months and body temperature was measured using a rectal probe (World Precision Instruments, Florida, USA). The behavioural tests measured visual tracking, locomotor activity, touch sensitivity and anxiety. Firstly, visual tracking was assessed using an optokinetic drum apparatus (Paradigm Therapeutics, Cambridge, U.K.). Secondly, locomotor activity was measured as the distance travelled, in one hour, using the LABORAS system (Metris, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). Finally, the percentage time spent in the open and closed arms of an elevated plus-maze apparatus was used to assess aversion to open spaces in the mice (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lister, 1987</xref>). All procedures conformed to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
        <p>Randomly selected male and female mice (age 5–8 months) were killed by cervical dislocation in all RT-PCR and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments (Schedule 1: UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986).</p>

        <title>Analysis of sodium channel α- and β-subunit transcripts</title>
        <p>To quantify changes in the mRNA expression levels of sodium <italic>α</italic>- and <italic>β</italic>-subunits in hearts obtained from WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, RT-PCR experiments were performed on an ABI 7500 Fast cycler (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, U.K.). Total RNA was isolated from left atria (LA), right atria (RA), left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3 each) using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit. Excised tissues were stored in RNAlater<sup>®</sup> (Ambion, Warrington, U.K.) to maintain the integrity of the RNA before isolation. The total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers and a SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.). Oligos for <italic>Scn3b, Scn5a,</italic> and <italic>Scn1b</italic> were FAM/TAMRA labelled (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
        <p>The number of the copies of mRNA was calculated from its respective threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) using a standard curve. Each value was normalized for the expression value of the housekeeper gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and expressed as a percentage of GAPDH expression (i.e. 2<sup>ΔCT</sup> × 100).</p>

        <title>Preparation of Langendorff-perfused hearts for electrophysiological recordings</title>
        <p>The experiments used Langendorff-perfused murine hearts as previously described (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam et al., 2003</xref>). Hearts were rapidly excised whilst minimizing contact with the atria and ventricles, then submerged in ice-cold bicarbonate-buffered Krebs–Henseleit solution containing (mM): 119 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4.0 KCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose and 2.0 sodium-pyruvate (pH 7.4) and bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixture (British Oxygen Company, Manchester, U.K.). Under the ice-cold buffer, excess tissues surrounding the heart were removed, leaving a 2–3 mm section of the aorta. This was cannulated and sealed, using a micro-aneurysm clip (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, U.K.) to a 21-gauge tailor-made cannula. The latter was pre-filled with ice-cold buffer solution using a 1 ml syringe. The preparation was transferred and attached to a Langendorff system, and then retrogradely perfused, using the bicarbonate-buffered Krebs–Henseleit solution described above, warmed to 37 °C via a water jacket and circulator (Techne model C-85 A, Cambridge, U.K.). The warmed perfusate was initially passed through a 200 μm and 5 μm filter membrane (Millipore, Watford, U.K.), before being introduced into the aorta at a constant flow of 2–2.5 ml min<sup>−1</sup> using a peristaltic pump (Watson–Marlow Bredel model 505S, Falmouth, Cornwall, U.K.). The cannulated hearts were perfused for 5 min before further testing. Viable, healthy hearts then regained a homogenous pink colouration and spontaneous rhythmic contraction. Hearts that did not demonstrate these features upon perfusion were instantly discarded.</p>

        <title>Bipolar electrogram recording</title>
        <p>In all experiments analysing the ventricles of the isolated, perfused murine heart, paired platinum stimulating electrodes (1 mm interpole spacing) were positioned over the epicardial surface of the right ventricle. Ventricular activity was examined by recording from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle using a silver chloride (2 mm tip diameter) recording electrode (Linton Instruments, Harvard Apparatus, U.K.), which was manually positioned. The electrical signals recorded from these hearts resulted in bipolar electrogram (BEG) recordings. The paired platinum stimulating electrodes paced the epicardial surface of the right ventricle and the stimulation used a 2 ms square-wave stimuli at three times excitation threshold (Grass-Telefactor, U.K., Slough, U.K.). These signals were amplified and high-pass filtered for recordings of murine heart (30–1 kHz) using a Gould 2400S amplifier (Gould-Nicolet Technologies, Ilford, Essex, U.K.) and then digitised using an analogue to digital converter (CED 1401plus MKII, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, U.K.) at a sampling frequency of 5 kHz. All digitised data was then captured and analysed using Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p>

        <title>Monophasic action potential recording and regular pacing</title>
        <p>In addition to ventricular BEGs, monophasic action potentials (MAPs) of the ventricles were also recorded using an established contact-electrode technique (<xref rid="bib13 bib23 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Franz, 1999; Killeen et al., 2007; Knollmann et al., 2001</xref>). The stimulating electrodes were positioned on the basal surface of the right ventricular epicardium and used to deliver electrical stimulation, as described above. Each isolated perfused heart underwent a period of regular pacing using 2 ms square-wave stimuli, delivered at three times the excitation threshold, at a basic cycle length (BCL) of 125 ms, for up to 20 min to record both epicardial and endocardial MAPs. Epicardial MAPs were recorded from the basal surface of the left ventricular epicardium using the silver chloride recording electrode. Endocardial MAPs were also obtained, from the left ventricular endocardium using a custom-made endocardial MAP electrode, constructed from two Teflon-coated (0.25 mm diameter) silver wires (99.99%) (Advent Research Materials Ltd. Oxford, U.K.), that were twisted together and galvanically chlorided. This electrode was inserted through a small access window carefully created in the interventricular septum (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Casimiro et al., 2001</xref>). The tip of the electrode was rotated and positioned against the left ventricular free wall, maintaining stable contact pressure. Signals obtained from the recording electrode were amplified and low-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 1.0 kHz using the Gould 2400S amplifier (Gould-Nicolet Technologies) and digitised using the CED 1401plus MKII analogue to digital converter (Cambridge Electronic Design) as described above. Both epicardial and endocardial MAP waveforms were analysed using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p>
        <p>MAPs that were used for analysis, satisfied previously established waveform characteristics including a stable baseline, a rapid upstroke phase with consistent amplitude, a smooth contoured repolarization, a stable duration and 100% repolarization achieved by a full return to the baseline (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stokoe et al., 2007a</xref>). These MAP waveforms were used to obtain action potential durations (APDs) at 30% (APD<sub>30</sub>), 50% (APD<sub>50</sub>), 70% (APD<sub>70</sub>) and 90% (APD<sub>90</sub>) repolarization. Transmural gradients of repolarization (ΔAPD<sub>90</sub>) were calculated as endocardial APD<sub>90</sub> value minus the epicardial APD<sub>90</sub> value (<xref rid="bib23 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Killeen et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

        <title>Programmed electrical stimulation</title>
        <p>Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was used to assess ventricular arrhythmogenesis in each heart preparation and recorded as BEGs and MAPs (<xref rid="bib2 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam et al., 2003; Saumarez and Grace, 2000</xref>). The PES protocol first paced the heart for 25 s at the BCL. This was followed by cycles each consisting of an eight stimuli (S<sub>1</sub>) drive train at a CL of 125 ms followed by a ninth extra-stimulus (S<sub>2</sub>). The first S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval (between the eighth S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> stimuli) equalled the pacing interval. Successive cycles progressively reduced the S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval by 1 ms until the S<sub>2</sub> stimulus could no longer evoke a ventricular deflection, at which point, the whole heart preparation reached the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). VERP was hence defined as the longest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval that could not elicit a ventricular deflection.</p>
        <p>From the ventricular BEGs obtained, conduction curves were constructed, using paced electrogram fractionation analysis (PEFA), a procedure applied in clinical practice (<xref rid="bib16 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Head et al., 2005; Saumarez and Grace, 2000</xref>). These curves plotted the response latencies of each S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus, defined as the time difference between the extra-stimulus and the peak and troughs of the resulting BEG, against the corresponding S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval. The electrogram duration (EGD) is characterised as the time difference between the first and last BEG peak and trough. The EGD ratios from corresponding conduction curves were calculated by normalizing the EGD of the BEG obtained from the shortest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval with the EGD of the longest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stokoe et al., 2007a</xref>). The initial conduction latency was defined as the time difference from the initial S<sub>2</sub> stimulus applied at the S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval of 125 ms and the initial deflection of the resulting electrogram response.</p>

        <title>Ventricular myocyte isolation</title>
        <p>A solution consisting of (in mM): 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 sodium-pyruvate, 10 glucose, 20 taurine and 10 HEPES was used as the basic isolation buffer. This was used to make the following solutions. Firstly, an NTA buffer consisted of the isolation buffer and 5 mM nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). The pH of this buffer was adjusted to 6.95. Secondly, a digestion buffer, which contained the isolation buffer to which 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> collagenase type 2 (Worthington, NJ, U.S.A.) and 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> hyaluronidase (Sigma–Aldrich, Poole, U.K.) was added. Thirdly, a stop buffer was created, which contained the isolation buffer and 2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> bovine serum albumin (Sigma–Aldrich). Fourthly, the isolation buffer to which 0.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added, was created as the wash buffer. Finally, a storage buffer, similar to the wash buffer but with 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, was made. All the buffers created, except for the NTA buffer, had their pH adjusted to 7.4.</p>
        <p>Hearts of adult mice were rapidly excised and submerged in ice-cold isolation buffer, prior to whole-heart isolation. The hearts were then perfused for 2 min with NTA buffer in a retrograde fashion using a variable speed peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 3.5 ml ms<sup>−1</sup> (Autoclude EV045, Essex, U.K.). Before perfusion, the buffer was warmed to 37 °C with a water jacket and circulator (Techne model RB-5 A, Cambridge, U.K.). Following this, the heart was then perfused in the same fashion with the digestion buffer for 12–15 min. Using watchmaker's forceps, ventricular tissue was taken from the whole heart and placed in the stop buffer. After transferring into a 15 ml test tube, gentle trituration was used to isolate single myocytes from the harvested cardiac tissue. After 5 min for the cells to settle, the supernatant was then gently removed. The isolated cells were then washed using wash buffer. Following a further 5 min, the isolated myocytes were resuspended and stored in the storage buffer. After each step after harvesting the cells, isolated myocytes were checked under a light microscope to confirm cell integrity. Live myocytes appeared as smooth and rod-shaped cells.</p>

        <title>I<sub>Na</sub> measurements</title>
        <p>The biophysical experiments studied the activation, inactivation and recovery from inactivation in the Na<sup>+</sup> channels of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes. These experiments were carried out at a physiological temperature of 37 °C, using the whole-cell configuration, with an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Berkshire, U.K.). Borosilicate glass pipettes (0.86 mm outer diameter; Harvard Apparatus, Kent, U.K) with a resistance of 1.5–2.5 MΩ were used. These pipettes were filled with (in mM): 70.26 CsCl, 24.74 Cs-aspartate, 10 HEPES, 1 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 4 MgATP, 1.37 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 Cs-BAPTA, adjusted to pH 7.2 using CsOH. Cells were loaded into a chamber which was mounted on the stage of a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Kingston, U.K.). These cells were initially perfused with an extracellular bath solution, which contained (in mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.4 using NaOH. To achieve optimum voltage control, Na<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded in a low [Na<sup>+</sup>] solution. This solution contained (in mM): 10 NaCl, 140 CsCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.4 using CsOH. The currents obtained were filtered at a 10 kHz high frequency cut off and digitised at 100 kHz using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). In each experiment, the series resistance was compensated by at least 70% and each protocol used a holding potential of −100 mV.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the voltage dependence of activation was studied by applying depolarizing pulses of 20 ms duration. These pulses were applied over series of voltage steps from −100 mV, in 10 mV increments, to 70 mV. The resulting currents were normalized against the cell capacitance (<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>) and plotted against time. The peak current densities (pA/pF) were calculated by dividing the peak currents amplitude by <italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>. The current–voltage relationship was obtained by plotting the values of the peak current density against each corresponding membrane voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>). The values of peak Na<sup>+</sup> conductance (<italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub>) values were determined from the equation<disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>,</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> was the peak current density and the <italic>E</italic><sub>Na</sub> was the [Na<sup>+</sup>] reversal potential. The <italic>E</italic><sub>Na</sub> was assumed to be 42.6 mV. This was based on the Nernst equation;<disp-formula><mml:math id="M2" altimg="si2.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>extracellular</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>intracellular</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>,</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>R</italic> is the universal gas constant, <italic>T</italic> is the absolute temperature at 310 K, <italic>z</italic> is the valence of the ionic species at 1, <italic>F</italic> is Faraday's constant, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>extracellular</sub> = 10 mM and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> = 2 mM. The <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> values calculated from each myocyte were normalized against the corresponding peak <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> value. When plotted against the test-pulse voltage, the data assumed a sigmoid function, increasing with membrane potential.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the voltage dependence of inactivation was examined using pre-pulses of 500 ms duration. These pre-pulses were applied over a voltage range from −120 mV to −20 mV in 10 mV increments. Each pre-pulse was followed by a test pulse to −20 mV at a duration of 10 ms. The peak currents obtained were normalized against the peak current recorded at the pre-pulse of −120 mV. The normalized currents were then plotted against the pre-pulse voltage. The data assumed a sigmoid function, decreasing with membrane potential. Both inactivation and activation data were fitted with a Boltzmann function:<disp-formula><mml:math id="M3" altimg="si3.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>yielding the half-maximal voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) and slope factor (<italic>k</italic>) values. The <italic>y</italic> values corresponded to the normalized current values.</p>
        <p>Finally, to determine the time course of recovery from inactivation, a protocol consisting of 18 cycles was employed. Each cycle consisted of a 1 s pre-pulse to −20 mV, used to achieve inactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels, followed by a return to the voltage of −100 mV to allow recovery of the channels. With each cycle, the duration of recovery increased from 1 to 250 ms. A 50 ms test pulse to −20 mV determined the current from the recovered channels. The currents recorded were normalized against the current obtained from each pre-pulse applied. A bi-exponential function was fitted to the recovery from inactivation data,<disp-formula><mml:math id="M4" altimg="si4.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>,</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>A</italic><sub>f</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>s</sub> are the amplitude of the fast and slow inactivating components, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>f</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>s</sub> are the time constants of the fast and slow components, respectively.

        <title>Gene targeting of Scn3b and generation of knockout mice</title>
        <p>To disrupt the <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> coding region, 191 bp of the 226 bp third exon of the <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> sequence was replaced by the IRES<italic>LacZ</italic>/pGKneo cassette (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). The 5′ arm of the plasmid used to generate the mutant contained a 2.0 kb fragment of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> locus terminating downstream of the third coding exon splice acceptor, and a 3′ arm which spanned 4.1 kb of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> locus commencing just upstream of the third coding exon splice donor. Successfully targeted ES cells were screened by Southern blot using an external 3′ probe (amplified from mouse genomic DNA using 3′prF; AGATGTCCAGCGATACTGTTGAGGCAG and 3′prR; TGTGAGTCTTATTGGAGGTACAGTGTG). Digestion with <italic>Afl</italic>II yielded a 7.7 kb endogenous band and a 12.6 kb bp targeted band as predicted. Similar experiments using <italic>Bcl</italic>I resulted in a 7.2 kb endogenous band and the predicted 7.8 kb bp targeted band (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Homozygous mutant (<italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) offspring were identified using PCR screening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). The primers used (hetF, GTCGTCTGCAGTGGAATGGGAGCAAAG; hetR, TGAAGAGACTACAGGCCTCAGGCTTAC; and Asc306, AATGGCCGCTTTTCTGGATTCATCGAC) resulted in the generation of a 204 bp band from the wild-type (WT) (+/+) allele, and a 334 bp band from the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (−/−) allele.

        <title>mRNA expression levels of Na<sup>+</sup> channel subunits in murine ventricles</title>
        <p>The mRNA expression studies demonstrated that <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA was not present and an increase in <italic>Scn1b</italic> mRNA in both the left and right ventricles of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. An increase in the <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA was observed only in the right ventricles of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. In all cases, the mRNA expression in the left ventricles was consistently higher. Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to investigate mRNA expression levels of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel <italic>β</italic>-subunits <italic>Scn3b</italic>, <italic>Scn1b</italic>, and the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>α</italic>-subunit, <italic>Scn5a</italic>, in tissue obtained from the right and left ventricles of mouse wild-type (WT) (RV+/+ and LV+/+; <italic>n</italic> = 3) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (RV−/− and LV−/−; <italic>n</italic> = 3). The number of the copies of mRNA was calculated from its respective threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) using a standard curve. Each value was normalized to the corresponding expression of the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).</p>
        <p>This made comparison between samples possible by correcting for any variation between the quantity of mRNA isolated from the WT and transgenic mouse hearts. Transcript expression was expressed as relative abundances of mRNA expression, calculated as a % of the GAPDH expression (i.e. 2<sup>ΔCT</sup> × 100). Firstly, the mRNA encoding the <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits, <italic>Scn3b</italic>, was expressed at statistically similar levels in both the left and right ventricles of WT hearts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>, black column, <italic>n</italic> = 3, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, both the ventricles of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 3), as expected, did not show any detectable expression of <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA.</p>
        <p>Secondly, both the left and right ventricles of the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B,</italic> white column) showed an increase in the expression levels of <italic>Scn1b</italic> mRNA, relative to corresponding values in WT hearts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Finally, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic> confirms the expression of the mRNA encoding for the α-subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel, <italic>Scn5a</italic>, in both ventricles of WT (black columns) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (white columns) hearts. The left ventricles of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated similar levels of <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA expression (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, the right ventricles of the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated a small but significant increase in the expression of <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA, than that shown in WT hearts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Thus, mRNA expression levels of <italic>Scn1b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic> were always higher in the left than in the right ventricles of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 3 each, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

        <title>Analysis of BEG recordings during PES</title>
        <p>The mRNA expression changes were correlated with a ventricular arrhythmogenic phenotype in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. This was demonstrated in electrophysiological experiments that assessed ventricular arrhythmogenicity in isolated, Langendorff-perfused WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> murine hearts. This was achieved by obtaining bipolar electrogram (BEG) (first series; 6 WT hearts and 7 <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts) and monophasic action potential (MAP) (second series; 14 WT hearts and 17 <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts, third series; 4 WT hearts and 4 <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts) recordings from the left ventricles. BEGs and MAPs were obtained once the preparations had regained a steady state after 10 min following mounting. BEG recordings were obtained during programmed electrical stimulation (PES). This procedure has been used in clinical situations to assess arrhythmogenicity and applied to murine hearts as described on previous occasions (<xref rid="bib2 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam et al., 2003; Saumarez and Grace, 2000</xref>). Hearts were initially paced at a basic cycle length (BCL) of 125 ms for 25 s. Subsequent cycles used a drive train each consisting of eight stimuli (S<sub>1</sub>) at the same BCL, followed by a premature extra-stimulus (S<sub>2</sub>). The initial S<sub>2</sub> stimulus was imposed at an S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval of 125 ms. With each cycle, this interval was reduced by 1 ms, until either the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) was reached, at which point the premature S<sub>2</sub> did not trigger a response or resulted in ventricular tachycardia (VT).</p>
        <p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows examples of BEG traces obtained during PES. Each trace demonstrates results from the final cycles that corresponded to the shortest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> intervals. The single vertical marks below each recording indicate the successive S<sub>1</sub> stimuli and the double vertical marks, the S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimuli. Furthermore, each trace contains stimulus artefacts that occurred at regular CL, followed by their resulting electrogram. In the case of WT hearts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>), shortening of the S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval led to an S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus that did not elicit an electrogram. This S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval corresponded to the VERP. In contrast, under such circumstances, a significant proportion of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed ventricular arrhythmias (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p>
        <p>Conduction curves were then derived from the BEG recordings obtained during PES, using paced electrogram fractionation analysis (PEFA), a procedure that has been used to assess clinical risk of ventricular arrhythmogenicity on earlier occasions (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Saumarez and Grace, 2000</xref>).

The duration of these waveforms were defined as the final EGD. The EGD ratio was calculated as the final EGD divided by the initial EGD.

        <title>Analysis of MAP recordings during PES</title>
        <p>Analysis of MAP recordings permitted a closer differentiation of hearts with arrhythmogenic and non-arrhythmogenic phenotypes as well as of monomorphic and polymorphic VT. MAP waveforms were compared during PES in a second series of isolated, perfused WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. Each heart was subjected to an application of a single procedure of PES. This made it possible to determine when VT occurred, whether it was monomorphic or polymorphic. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> illustrates MAP recordings obtained from WT (<italic>A</italic>) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>) hearts during the final cycles of a PES procedure that corresponded to the shortest S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> intervals. In each panel, the single vertical mark below each recording indicates the S<sub>1</sub> stimuli and the double vertical mark the S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus. The traces also show the corresponding stimulus artefacts that occurred at a regular CL, closely followed by their elicited MAP. MAPs in response to S<sub>1</sub> stimuli were consistent in waveform in both WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts, with each AP demonstrating a stable baseline, rapid upstroke and smooth repolarisation phase (<xref rid="bib11 bib15 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Fabritz et al., 2003; Guo et al., 1999; Killeen et al., 2007</xref>).

        <p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic> shows a typical MAP recording obtained during the final cycles of the PES procedure in a WT heart. The first S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus that is displayed, gave rise to an action potential. However, the heart was refractory in response to the second S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus, thereby permitting the determination of the VERP. In contrast, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed episodes of either monomorphic (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>) or polymorphic VT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>) following an S<sub>2</sub> extra-stimulus. Monomorphic VT showed successive ventricular deflections that were of similar waveform and amplitude. Polymorphic VT demonstrated varying intervals between each successive deflection with irregular amplitudes and waveforms. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarises the properties of the MAP waveforms during PES in WT (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 17). It lists the VERP shown in non-arrhythmogenic hearts. Where the heart was arrhythmogenic, it lists the S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval value, which would be less than the VERP. The WT hearts had a mean VERP of 39.3 ± 1.6 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 14). PES did not induce VT in any of the WT hearts. In contrast to WT hearts, only 7 out of 17 <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts were non-arrhythmogenic. These hearts had a mean VERP of 43.3 ± 4.4 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 7). This was not significantly different from the corresponding mean VERP, recorded in WT hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 14, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The remaining <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts were arrhythmogenic in response to a mean S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval of &lt;29.3 ± 2.4 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 10).

The mean duration of the VT was 98.85 ± 39.8 s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B, C</italic>). In 5 out of the 10 arrhythmogenic hearts, the hearts showed monomorphic VT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). The mean duration of episodes of monomorphic VT was 100.6 ± 46.4 s (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In 4 hearts out of 10 arrhythmogenic hearts, the hearts demonstrated polymorphic VT. The mean duration of the polymorphic VT was 27.3 ± 13.8 s. Finally, PES-induced VT in the remaining heart began as a monomorphic VT and deteriorated into polymorphic VT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>).

        <title>Endocardial and epicardial MAP recordings in WT and Scn3b<sup>−/−</sup> hearts</title>
        <p>Comparison of endocardial and epicardial recordings suggested that <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed a shorter endocardial and epicardial APD<sub>90</sub> which nevertheless demonstrated a normal transmural gradient of repolarization, ΔAPD<sub>90</sub>. Previous studies have demonstrated that arrhythmogenic properties were associated with abnormal differences in epicardial and endocardial APDs (<xref rid="bib23 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Killeen et al., 2007; Stokoe et al., 2007b</xref>). The present investigation made similar experiments, which recorded MAPs at the BCL from the left ventricular epicardium and endocardium of a third series of hearts. Measurements were obtained from five separate 20 s periods during regular pacing. For each period taken, the recording electrode was repositioned to obtain independent readings from different regions of the ventricle. This was to ensure the values obtained were comparable. Action potential duration (APD) at 30% (APD<sub>30</sub>), 50% (APD<sub>50</sub>), 70% (APD<sub>70</sub>) and 90% (APD<sub>90</sub>) repolarization values were obtained from the MAPs.</p>
        <p><xref rid="tbl6 tbl7" ref-type="table">Tables 6 and 7</xref> summarise the APD values obtained from the epicardium and endocardium. Endocardial APD values in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts were significantly shorter than their corresponding WT endocardial values. Thus, the endocardial APD<sub>30</sub>, APD<sub>50</sub>, APD<sub>70</sub> and APD<sub>90</sub> recorded in WT hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 4) were 10.5 ± 1.4, 18.8 ± 2.1, 31.2 ± 2.9 and 53.6 ± 2.7 ms respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). The same measurements made in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts demonstrated APD values of 6.2 ± 0.1 ms, 12.3 ± 1.2 ms, 20.2 ± 1.6 ms and 41.0 ± 3.8 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> epicardial APD<sub>70</sub> and APD<sub>90</sub> values were also significantly shorter than their respective WT APD<sub>70</sub> and APD<sub>90</sub> values. Thus, the epicardial APD<sub>70</sub> and APD<sub>90</sub> values obtained from WT hearts were 17.7 ± 1.6 ms and 38.7 ± 2.8 ms respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>).

Epicardial APD<sub>30</sub> and APD<sub>50</sub> values were both similar in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The transmural gradient of repolarization (ΔAPD<sub>90</sub>) was quantified as the difference between the values of the endocardial APD<sub>90</sub> and epicardial APD<sub>90</sub> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Killeen et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and WT hearts showed similar positive ΔAPD<sub>90</sub> (14.0 ± 3.4 ms vs. 15.4 ± 4.4 ms, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>).

        <title>Na<sup>+</sup> current recordings in isolated ventricular myocytes</title>
        <p>The electrophysiological changes in the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> whole heart was correlated with a reduction in the peak Na<sup>+</sup> current and a shift in the inactivation curve in the negative direction. The activation properties and recovery from inactivation remained similar in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes. The effects of the expression of <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits on Na<sup>+</sup> currents were assessed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on cardiac myocytes isolated from WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. In all experiments, the series resistance was compensated by at least 70% and each protocol used a holding voltage of −100 mV.</p>
        <p>Firstly, Na<sup>+</sup> current densities and voltage dependence of activation were assessed using a pulse protocol which applied depolarizing pulses of 20 ms duration, from a holding potential of −100 mV, to test potentials between −90 and 70 mV in 10 mV increments. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic> compares families of representative current traces obtained from WT (left panel) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (right panel) myocytes in response to voltage steps, between the test potentials of −100 to 30 mV. In all the WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes examined, the greatest magnitude of peak Na<sup>+</sup> current density was observed at voltage steps to either −30 or −40 mV. However, the maximum value of the peak Na<sup>+</sup> current density was significantly smaller in the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes, compared to that shown in WT myocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Thus, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic> demonstrates that the maximum value of the peak current density at −30 mV was significantly reduced by 30% in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes when compared to that shown in WT myocytes (90.4 ± 4.3 pA/pF, <italic>n</italic> = 7 vs. 63.3 ± 4.8 pA/pF, <italic>n</italic> = 7 each, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic> plots the peak Na<sup>+</sup> current densities obtained from WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes against the corresponding test potentials. The peak Na<sup>+</sup> current densities in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>, white triangles) at −30 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), −20 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), −10 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 0 mV (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were significantly smaller than the corresponding densities recorded in WT myocytes (black triangles, <italic>n</italic> = 7 each).</p>
        <p>Secondly, to examine changes in the biophysics of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel activation and inactivation properties were assessed in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes. The activation function of Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>, squares) in WT (black) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (white) myocytes was obtained by plotting the peak Na<sup>+</sup> conductance (<italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub>) (peak <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub>) values against <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Peak <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> values were calculated by the following formula;<disp-formula><mml:math id="M5" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Na</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>,</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> was the peak current density, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was membrane voltage and the <italic>E</italic><sub>Na</sub> was the reversal potential of Na<sup>+</sup> ions. This was calculated from the intracellular and extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration as an assumed value of 42.6 mV. The peak <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> values obtained were normalized to the corresponding maximum peak <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> values.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, the voltage dependence of inactivation was assessed using pre-pulses of 500 ms duration. These pre-pulses were applied over a voltage range from −120 to −20 mV in 10 mV increments. A test pulse to −20 mV of duration of 10 ms immediately followed this. The resulting currents were normalized against the Na<sup>+</sup> current recorded at the pre-pulse at −120 mV. The inactivation function (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>, circles) in WT (black) and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (white) myocytes was obtained by plotting the normalized currents against <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. The continuous lines display the Boltzmann functions fitted to the activation and inactivation data. The data was used to obtain the half-maximal voltages (<italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) and slope factor (<italic>k</italic>) values of both activation and inactivation in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes (<xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The activation function of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes remained similar, despite a smaller Na<sup>+</sup> current recorded in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes. Thus, the <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and <italic>k</italic> values of WT (−41.0 ± 0.2 mV and 2.4 ± 0.3 mV) were similar to those in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts (−43.6 ± 0.4 mV and 2.1 ± 0.2 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 7 each, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, the inactivation curve of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes was shifted in the negative direction relative to the corresponding curve in WT myocytes. Thus, the <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> in the voltage dependence of inactivation of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes was −59.5 ± 0.4 mV and −67.0 ± 0.4 mV respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 7 each, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
        <p>However, the slope factors of the inactivation curves were similar in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes (WT; 5.7 ± 0.3 mV vs. <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; 6.4 ± 0.4 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 7 each, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). At the holding potential of −100 mV, the normalized inactivation current was 0.95 in both WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, at a depolarized potential of −80 mV, the normalized values were 0.93 and 0.84 in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes respectively. This suggests that at −80 mV, an additional 10% of the channels in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes were already inactivated, compared to those in WT myocytes. Furthermore, the percentage of inactivated channels in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes, compared to WT myocytes, increases to 37% at a potential of −70 mV. This was calculated from the normalized current values of 0.83 and 0.61 in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes respectively.</p>
        <p>Finally, the time course of recovery from inactivation was examined using a 1 s pre-pulse to −20 mV. This was followed by a return to the holding voltage of −100 mV to allow recovery, at varying durations between 1 and 250 ms. A test pulse at a duration of 50 ms to −20 mV determined the current observed in fractions of recovered channels. The currents recorded were normalized against the current obtained from each of the 1 s pre-pulses applied. To determine the relative proportion of channels that were in the fast (<italic>τ</italic>-fast) and slow (<italic>τ</italic>-slow) phase, a 2-exponential function was fitted to the data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the time constants and fractions of the <italic>τ</italic>-fast (WT; 2.3 ± 0.5 ms and 0.83 ± 0.07, <italic>n</italic> = 7 vs. <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; 2.1 ± 0.2 ms and 0.97 ± 0.04, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and <italic>τ</italic>-slow (WT; 27.1 ± 7.5 ms and 0.3 ± 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 7 vs. <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; 39.5 ± 5.3 ms and 0.27 ± 0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) values obtained (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p>

      <p>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel function is critical for normal initiation, conduction and propagation of cardiac electrical activity (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Grant, 2001</xref>). Thus, mutations in the <italic>SCN5A</italic> gene, which encodes for the pore-forming <italic>α</italic>-subunit of the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, result in clinical arrhythmic conditions that include the Brugada syndrome (BrS) (<xref rid="bib4 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brugada and Brugada, 1992; Chen et al., 1998</xref>) and long QT syndrome 3 (LQT3) (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1995</xref>).

Of these, the <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1992</xref>), <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995a</xref>), <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub> subunits (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2003</xref>) are encoded by <italic>SCN1B</italic>, <italic>SCN2B</italic>, <italic>SCN3B</italic> and <italic>SCN4B</italic> respectively. The remaining <italic>β</italic><sub>1A</sub> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kazen-Gillespie et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>β</italic><sub>1B</sub> (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2003</xref>) subunits are generated by splice variants of <italic>SCN1B</italic>. mRNA transcripts encoding for these <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub> subunits are expressed in a wide range of human tissues that include brain, skeletal (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Candenas et al., 2006</xref>) and cardiac muscle (<xref rid="bib20 bib30 bib35 bib40 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995b; Makita et al., 1994; Morgan et al., 2000; Qin et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003</xref>). The expression of these subunits is thought to be important in normal surface expression (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Isom et al., 1995b</xref>) and determining the biophysical characteristics of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref rid="bib8 bib33 bib35 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2002; Meadows et al., 2002; Morgan et al., 2000; Patton et al., 1994</xref>). It has also been suggested that cleaved forms of the <italic>β</italic>-subunits may act as transcription factors for mRNA transcripts encoding for Na<sup>+</sup> channel subunits. Thus, the cleaved intracellular domain of the <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> subunit has been shown to increase the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 <italic>α</italic>-subunits (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the ventricles of <italic>Scn1b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts have greater expression levels of <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA than do WT hearts (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007</xref>). Modifications in <italic>β</italic>-subunits thus have potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology.</p>
      <p>We report, for the first time, that deficiencies in the <italic>Scn3b</italic> gene in a murine system lead to altered biochemical and biophysical properties of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel, resulting in abnormal ventricular electrophysiology. <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were first created using homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Such mice showed no significant changes in behavioural and metabolic tests compared to those assessed in WT mice. These findings are in contrast to those shown in <italic>Scn1b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which demonstrate ataxic gait, generalized seizures and growth retardation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis not only confirmed the presence or absence of <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA in WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts respectively, but also that the <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA or protein may exert a regulatory role on the expression of <italic>Scn1b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA in murine ventricles. Firstly, it demonstrated that <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA was expressed in wild-type (WT) with similar expression in both the left and right ventricles. This was in agreement with previous studies that had demonstrated that <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits were expressed in the ventricular myocytes obtained from WT and <italic>Scn1b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse hearts, specifically in the transverse tubules (<xref rid="bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2004</xref>). As expected, <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA was not expressed in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. Secondly, the <italic>Scn1b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA in both WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ventricles were expressed at higher levels compared to the expression of <italic>Scn3b</italic> mRNA in WT hearts, confirming a previous report concerning such experiments in WT hearts (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Marionneau et al., 2005</xref>). Thirdly, <italic>Scn1b</italic> mRNA was expressed at higher levels in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts than in WT hearts. These levels of expression were greater in the left than in the right ventricles in both WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. Finally, <italic>Scn5a</italic> mRNA was expressed at similar levels in the left ventricles of WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. It was expressed at higher levels in the right ventricles of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts, compared to levels in the right ventricles of WT hearts.</p>
      <p>Electrophysiological studies in the ventricles of the whole intact <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts also showed arrhythmogenesis and conduction abnormalities. This arrhythmogenesis took the form of either monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (VTs). These electrophysiological findings showed both similarities and contrasts to earlier results obtained from experiments on arrhythmogenic murine <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup>, <italic>Kcne1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and hypokalaemic hearts, as well as human BrS (<xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>(A)). The murine systems had been used to model human BrS, LQT3, LQT5 and hypokalaemia, respectively (<xref rid="bib2 bib16 bib23 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramaniam et al., 2003; Head et al., 2005; Killeen et al., 2007; Papadatos et al., 2002</xref>). Firstly, the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed VT during programmed electrical stimulation (PES) and paced electrogram fractionation analysis (PEFA) of these results demonstrated abnormal conduction curves, in common with the remaining examples in <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>(A). These curves showed that <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts had electrogram duration (EGD) ratios that were significantly longer but conduction latencies that were similar at the S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub> interval of 125 ms as those shown in WT hearts. Secondly, the <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts showed shorter ventricular effective refractory periods (VERPs) than in WT hearts, in common with findings from hypokalaemic hearts and clinical cases of BrS but in contrast to features shown by the remaining murine models. Finally, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts had shorter endocardial and epicardial APD<sub>90</sub> values than did WT hearts. Nevertheless, the difference between these values in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts, which offers a measure of the transmural gradient of repolarization in the form of the ΔAPD<sub>90</sub>, was similar to that shown by WT hearts. This is in common with findings in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> hearts but in contrast to the remaining examples.</p>
      <p>The use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique demonstrated the loss of function of the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel in ventricular myocytes isolated from <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hearts. These experiments were carried out at the same temperature of 37 °C as the studies used on intact hearts in contrast to previous investigations that had carried out similar single cell experiments at room temperature (<xref rid="bib28 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007; Papadatos et al., 2002</xref>). <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>(B) compares the resulting Na<sup>+</sup> channel properties in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes with those shown in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup> myocytes and points to a number of important comparisons. Firstly, <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes showed significantly smaller peak Na<sup>+</sup> current densities, in response to depolarizing voltage steps from a −100 mV holding potential, than did WT myocytes. This was in common with previous findings in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> myocytes but in contrast to those shown in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup> myocytes (<xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>(B)). This suggests a reduced expression or proportion of functional Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane of <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ventricles compared to that shown in WT ventricles. The present experiments were performed under conditions of higher ratios of extracellular and intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>]. This may account for the larger Na<sup>+</sup> current densities observed in the present study, compared to those observed in previous investigations (<xref rid="bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nuyens et al., 2001; Papadatos et al., 2002</xref>). Both latter studies used lower extracellular and intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] ratios of 2:1 and 2:2 respectively and carried out single cell experiments at room temperature (22–23 °C). Such conditions had resulted in peak Na<sup>+</sup> current densities of ∼15 pA/pF and 21 ± 5 pA/pF respectively. Secondly, the Na<sup>+</sup> channel activation properties in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes were similar to those of WT myocytes in common with findings in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup> myocytes. However, the present findings were obtained at a higher temperature of 37 °C than used in the previous studies (<xref rid="bib28 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007; Papadatos et al., 2002</xref>). This may account for the similarly highly rapid time courses of activation and small slope factors of steady-state activation observed in both the WT and <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes. Thirdly, the position of the inactivation curves in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes was nevertheless shifted in the negative direction relative to that shown in WT myocytes, whereas both <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup> myocytes showed normal inactivation curves. At a typical resting membrane potential between −80 and −70 mV (<xref rid="bib15 bib42 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 1999; Remme et al., 2006; Yao et al., 1998</xref>), such a shift would result in the inactivation of a further 10 to 37% of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes, compared to that shown in WT myocytes. Finally, the time course in the recovery from inactivation in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes were similar to that shown in WT myocytes in common with findings in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/ΔKPQ</sup> myocytes.</p>
      <p>Together, the altered peak Na<sup>+</sup> current density and inactivation features shown in <italic>Scn3b</italic><sup>−/−</sup> myocytes are compatible with a reduction of the total <italic>in vivo</italic> Na<sup>+</sup> current. This is compatible with findings in BrS. Thus, although the clinical cases of BrS have shown a wide range of alterations in the activation, inactivation and recovery from inactivation properties, all show reduced Na<sup>+</sup> currents. The present findings also add a further example of BrS that involves mutations in the Na<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>β</italic>-subunit. A previous investigation had identified a single mutation in the <italic>SCN1B</italic> gene and two mutations in the splice variant of the same gene in patients with BrS (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). It used a heterologous expression system provided by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, to study the consequent changes in the biophysical properties of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel resulting from the mutations. In agreement with the present example, cells expressing both the WT Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and such mutant <italic>β</italic>-subunits showed significantly reduced peak Na<sup>+</sup> currents. In contrast, activation and inactivation properties of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel shifted in the positive direction in relation to findings in cells expressing WT Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and WT <italic>β</italic>-subunits. The present findings also complement other investigations in which alterations in the <italic>β</italic>-subunit expression can produce other electrophysiological changes that include a LQT-like phenotype. For example, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Santiago et al. (2007)</xref> associated a deletion of the <italic>Scn1b</italic> gene in a murine system with an increase in peak Na<sup>+</sup> currents and QT prolongation.</p>
      <p>The present findings complement reports of altered Na<sup>+</sup> channel biophysical properties resulting from <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> expression in heterologous expression systems by describing the consequences of similar expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the properties of such <italic>in vitro</italic> expression systems may not correspond to features observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and have demonstrated conflicting results despite the transfection of identical sets of genes. Such systems lack functionally important proteins such as ankyrin proteins that form complexes with the Na<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abriel and Kass, 2005</xref>). Thus, on the one hand, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes injected with cRNA for Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits demonstrated significantly larger peak Na<sup>+</sup> currents and positive shifts in the inactivation curves than in cells expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 only (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fahmi et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, CHO cells expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> subunits resulted in similar peak Na<sup>+</sup> currents with negative shifts in the activation and inactivation curves compared to cells expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 only (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have for the first time associated the lack of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> gene with a ventricular arrhythmogenesis in intact perfused hearts whose features are similar to those shown in <italic>Scn5a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> hearts.</p>

        <p>Targeted deletion of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> gene. (<italic>A</italic>) Schematic representation of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> allele that was targeted for deletion. The top line shows a partial restriction map of the <italic>Scn3b</italic> locus, indicating the restriction sites for <italic>Afl</italic>II (<italic>A</italic>) and <italic>Bcl</italic>I (<italic>B</italic>). The centre line represents the targeted vector and the predicted targeted allele after homologous recombination shown in the bottom line. The location of the PCR primers and the probe used for screening the correctly targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells and the mice are shown.
