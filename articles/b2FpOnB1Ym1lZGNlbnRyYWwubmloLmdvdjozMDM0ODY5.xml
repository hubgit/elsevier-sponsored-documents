      <abstract>
        <p>The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2 are cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by triple-helical collagen. While normal DDR signalling regulates fundamental cellular processes, aberrant DDR signalling is associated with several human diseases. We previously identified GVMGFO (O is hydroxyproline) as a major DDR2 binding site in collagens I–III, and located two additional DDR2 binding sites in collagen II. Here we extend these studies to the homologous DDR1 and the identification of DDR binding sites on collagen III. Using sets of overlapping triple-helical peptides, the Collagen II and Collagen III Toolkits, we located several DDR2 binding sites on both collagens. The interaction of DDR1 with Toolkit peptides was more restricted, with DDR1 mainly binding to peptides containing the GVMGFO motif. Triple-helical peptides containing the GVMGFO motif induced DDR1 transmembrane signalling, and DDR1 binding and receptor activation occurred with the same amino acid requirements as previously defined for DDR2. While both DDRs exhibit the same specificity for binding the GVMGFO motif, which is present only in fibrillar collagens, the two receptors display distinct preferences for certain non-fibrillar collagens, with the basement membrane collagen IV being exclusively recognised by DDR1. Based on our recent crystal structure of a DDR2-collagen complex, we designed mutations to identify the molecular determinants for DDR1 binding to collagen IV. By replacing five amino acids in DDR2 with the corresponding DDR1 residues we were able to create a DDR2 construct that could function as a collagen IV receptor.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Collagens constitute the most abundant protein family in vertebrates and are crucial for the development, growth, and mechanical stability of connective tissues (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2004</xref>). Collagens are characterised by the presence of triple-helical domains, composed of three collagen α chains with repeated Gly-X-X′ motifs, where X is frequently proline and X′ 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp, O) (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and Persikov, 2005</xref>). Most collagens self-assemble into higher order structures such as fibrils or networks. The fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI) are mainly constituted of uninterrupted triple-helical domains of ~ 1000 amino acids and play important architectural roles in many connective tissues, while the network-forming collagen type IV is a key component of basement membranes. In addition to determining mechanical properties of tissues, collagens also interact with other extracellular matrix proteins and cell surface receptors, thus regulating fundamental cellular processes such as adhesion and signalling (<xref rid="bb0065 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Heino, 2007; Leitinger and Hohenester, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The most widely expressed mammalian receptors for collagen are four members of the β1 integrin family and two homologous receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the discoidin domain receptors DDR1 and DDR2. The interactions of collagens with integrins have been extensively characterised (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger and Hohenester, 2007</xref>), in particular for α1β1 and α2β1, and are understood in atomic detail for the α2β1 integrin (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Emsley et al., 2000</xref>). Integrins recognise discrete amino acid sequences in triple-helical collagen, such as the high-affinity binding motif GFOGER (<xref rid="bb0095 bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). The interactions of the DDRs with collagen are less well understood. Both DDRs interact with several collagen types in their native triple-helical conformation (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). Collagen-induced DDR signalling controls cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, as well as re-modelling of extracellular matrices (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). Both receptors play important roles in development. DDR1 controls mammary gland development (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2001</xref>) and kidney function (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al., 2004</xref>), while DDR2 regulates the growth of long bones (<xref rid="bb0015 bb0025 bb0090 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2010; Bargal et al., 2009; Kano et al., 2008; Labrador et al., 2001</xref>). Aberrant DDR function is associated with disease progression in fibrotic disorders of the lung, liver and kidney, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and several types of cancer (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>The DDRs are composed of an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, a large cytosolic juxtamembrane domain, and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Unlike canonical RTKs, which are thought to undergo ligand-induced dimerisation, the DDRs are pre-dimerised at the cell membrane in the absence of collagen (<xref rid="bb0010 bb0145 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Abdulhussein et al., 2008; Mihai et al., 2009; Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>). The DDR extracellular region consists of two domains: an N-terminal discoidin homology (DS) domain and a so-called stalk region unique to DDRs. Collagen binds to a specific site in the DS domain (<xref rid="bb0005 bb0080 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Abdulhussein et al., 2004; Ichikawa et al., 2007; Leitinger, 2003</xref>), which results in slow and sustained autophosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>Identifying interaction motifs for proteins on fibrillar collagens is made difficult by the large size of the collagenous domains and repetitive nature of the Gly-X-X′ motif. The use of synthetic triple-helical peptide analogues of collagen has allowed the identification of specific amino acid motifs within collagen that function as binding sites for interacting proteins (e.g. <xref rid="bb0095 bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, our recent development of the Collagen Toolkits has made possible the comprehensive analysis of binding sites within fibrillar collagen types II and III (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Farndale et al., 2008</xref>). The Collagen Toolkits are sets of overlapping triple-helical peptides encompassing the entire triple-helical domains of collagens II and III (<xref rid="bb0100 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008; Raynal et al., 2006</xref>). In a previous study we used the Collagen II Toolkit to identify binding sites for DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). Using truncated and alanine-substituted peptides, we defined a GVMGFO motif as a major DDR2-binding site present in collagens I–III. Our identification of the GVMGFO motif as a DDR2 ligand enabled the determination of a crystal structure of a complex between the DDR2 DS domain and a collagen peptide (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>While binding sites for DDR2 on collagen II have been mapped (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>), a similar analysis on collagen III has not been performed. Furthermore, the specific DDR1 binding sites on collagen are unknown. In the present work we extend our previous study to the analysis of DDR1 and DDR2 binding sites on collagens II and III. For DDR2, several distinct binding sites were defined on both collagens, whereas the interaction of DDR1 with the collagen peptides was mostly restricted to the GVMGFO motif. DDR1 binding and induction of receptor autophosphorylation occurred with the same amino acid requirements as previously defined for DDR2. Thus, both DDRs interact with the same specificity with the GVMGFO motif, which is found in the fibrillar collagens I–III (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the two receptors are known to have distinct preferences for certain non-fibrillar collagen types, such as the exclusive binding of DDR1 to the basement membrane collagen IV (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997</xref>), and the preferred binding of DDR2 to collagen X (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger and Kwan, 2006</xref>). Based on our recent DDR2-collagen peptide crystal structure (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>), we here define the molecular determinants for the different collagen IV-binding specificities of the two DDRs. By replacing five amino acids in DDR2 with DDR1 residues we were able to create a DDR2 construct that could function as a collagen IV receptor.</p>

        <title>New recombinant proteins to analyse DDR collagen binding</title>
        <p>We previously characterised binding of DDR extracellular domain constructs to collagen using solid phase binding assays. Both DDRs showed high-affinity binding to collagen I (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2003</xref>) but differed in their preference for collagens II, IV and X (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2003; Leitinger and Kwan, 2006; Leitinger et al., 2004</xref>). Our previous studies used two types of recombinant DDR ectodomain constructs: DDR1-Fc, comprising the entire DDR1 ectodomain, tagged with a dimerising human Fc tag (IgG1 sequence; see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>); and His-DDR2, comprising the DDR2 ectodomain tagged with a His tag and a Myc epitope (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2003</xref>). While constructs with both types of tags had been created for DDR1 and DDR2, only His-DDR2, but not His-DDR1, was functional. Conversely, only DDR1-Fc, but not DDR2-Fc, could be obtained, as the respective DDR2-Fc construct was not secreted from transfected cells. However, for DDR2, another Fc construct was successfully obtained: DS2-Fc, mainly consisting of the DDR2 DS domain, C-terminally tagged with human IgG1. DS2-Fc showed the same collagen binding specificity for fibrillar collagens as His-DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100 bb0120 bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008; Leitinger, 2003; Leitinger and Kwan, 2006; Leitinger et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>To compare the collagen binding specificities of DDR1 and DDR2 independently of the added tag, we have now created a new set of DDR ectodomain constructs, fused to the same Fc tag. By using an expression vector that introduces a spacer between the DDR ectodomains and the Fc tag (IgG2 sequence; see Methods), we successfully obtained DDR2-Fc, and an equivalent DDR1 construct, which we term DDR1-Fc2 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The new DDR-Fc proteins showed the same collagen binding specificities as the respective earlier ectodomain constructs, with DDR1-Fc2 binding well to collagens I and IV and DDR2-Fc exhibiting high-affinity binding to collagens I and II, but no binding to collagen IV (data not shown and <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), demonstrating that the tags do not influence the ability of the DDR ectodomains to bind collagen. We have used the new DDR-Fc constructs to extend our analysis of DDR binding sites on collagen.</p>

        <title>DDR2 binds to more sites on human collagens II and III than DDR1</title>
        <p>Our previous study identified DDR2 binding sites on collagen II (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>), but did not include any data on DDR1 binding sites, or on DDR binding sites on human collagen III. To identify sites in human collagens that act as DDR1 or DDR2 binding sites, we used the Collagen II and Collagen III Toolkits, two sets of overlapping synthetic triple-helical peptides encompassing the entire triple-helical domains of collagens II and III, respectively (<xref rid="bb0100 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008; Raynal et al., 2006</xref>). Recombinant DDRs were used to screen the Toolkit peptides for DDR binding in solid phase binding assays. Only one Collagen II Toolkit peptide, II-22, showed high binding to DDR1-Fc2, while peptides II-39 and II-46 gave a more modest response (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). A similar result was obtained using DDR1-Fc (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast to DDR1-Fc, DDR2-Fc showed high binding to several peptides (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), as expected from our previous results with His-DDR2 and DS2-Fc, which had identified three main DDR2 binding sites, resulting from DDR2 binding to Toolkit peptides II-13, II-22, II-23 and II-44 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, very similar results were obtained for DDR2-Fc, with strong binding to peptides II-13, II-22, II-23 and II-44 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Additionally, significant DDR2-Fc binding was also seen for peptides II-5 and II-39.</p>
        <p>The binding assays conducted with the Collagen III Toolkit showed very restricted binding of DDR1, with only one peptide, III-23, interacting with DDR1-Fc and DDR1-Fc2 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and Supplementary Fig. 2A). In contrast, several peptides interacted with DDR2. In addition to binding to III-23, DDR2-Fc bound III-5, III-39 and III-44 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). His-DDR2 (data not shown) and DS2-Fc displayed the same binding specificities as DDR2-Fc (Supplementary Fig. 2B).</p>

        <title>DDR1 and DDR2 bind the GVMGFO motif with the same amino acid requirements</title>
        <p>The overlapping sequence of peptides II-22 and II-23 is related to the central guest sequence of III-23 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In our previous work we identified the sequence GVMGFO, contained in these peptides, as the minimum collagen sequence required for DDR2 binding (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). Using a set of truncated peptides derived from III-23 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we obtained a similar result for DDR1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). With the exception of the peptide designated as GPR-GPK (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), DDR1Fc bound strongly to peptides containing the intact GVMGFO sequence, but did not bind to any peptides in which this hexapeptide sequence was truncated. DDR binding to intact collagen is strictly dependent on the native triple-helical collagen conformation. Similar to DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>), DDR1-Fc did not interact with peptide <underline>GAP</underline>-GPR-GFO, a non-helical peptide version of the high-affinity DDR ligand with guest sequence GPRGQOGVMGFO (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, last lanes). This indicates that peptide recognition by DDR1 in our system mirrors the interaction of DDR1 with native collagen. Furthermore, like DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>), DDR1 did not bind to a peptide containing the guest sequence GFOGER, a high-affinity integrin binding sequence (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>DDR1-Fc bound a set of alanine-substituted peptides (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the same specificity as we previously observed for DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Substituting either Phe or Met for Ala in GVMGFO was detrimental for DDR1 binding, while substituting Hyp for Ala in GVMGFO had a more modest effect. Replacing Arg in GPRGQOGVMGFO led to a modest reduction in binding, while all other X and X′ positions could be substituted without apparent loss of DDR1 binding (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In the heterotrimeric collagen I, composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain, the human sequence related to GPRGQOGVMGFO in collagen III and GARGQOGVMGFO in collagen II is G<underline>A</underline>RGQ<underline><italic>A</italic></underline>GVMGFO, which differs in two amino acids (underlined) from the collagen III sequence and one amino acid (underlined and italic) from the collagen II sequence. This sequence is found in the α1 chain. As expected from the results of the alanine-substituted peptides, this guest sequence interacted well with DDR1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). The sequence of the α2 chain that aligns with this sequence, GARG<underline>E</underline>OG<underline>NI</underline>GFO (where underlining highlights difference to the motif GARGQOGVMGFO in collagen II), was also recognised by DDR1 with similar apparent affinity, indicating that both collagen α chains may contribute to the corresponding DDR1 binding site in collagen I.</p>

        <title>Activation of DDR1 transmembrane signalling by GVMGFO-containing peptides</title>
        <p>We previously showed that DDR2 activation, as measured by receptor autophosphorylation, could be induced by incubating cells expressing full-length DDR2 with triple-helical peptides containing high-affinity GVMGFO motifs (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the present study for DDR1. Strong DDR1 autophosphorylation was induced with peptides containing GVMGFO in triple-helical form (peptides III-23, GPR-GFO and GPS-GFO, see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) but not in non-helical form (compare <underline>GAP</underline>-GPR-GFO to GPR-GFO) (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As previously established for DDR2, DDR1 was not activated by the non-binding peptide GPS-GFO-14A, in which Phe in GVMGFO is replaced by Ala, while other substitutions that retained DDR1 binding induced receptor autophosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the integrin ligand GFOGER could not induce DDR1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, triple-helical peptides comprising the DDR binding site activate DDR1 autophosphorylation in a specific manner.</p>

        <title>Only GVMGFO-containing peptides activate DDR2 transmembrane signalling</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B and 3B</xref>, DDR2 displayed strong binding to a number of peptides in addition to the GVMGFO-containing peptides II-22, II-23 and III-23. We tested the functional effects on DDR2 autophosphorylation of the peptides II-13, II-44, III-5, III-39 and III-44 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Strong phosphorylation of DDR2, comparable to that induced by collagen I, can be mediated by GVMGFO-containing peptides when used at 50–100 μg/ml in the medium (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to GVMGFO-containing peptides, none of the additional DDR2 binding peptides induced DDR2 autophosphorylation when tested at 100–300 μg/ml (data not shown), but peptide II-13 induced a weak phosphorylation signal when the peptide concentration was increased to 500 μg/ml (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, only GVMGFO-containing peptides are able to act as receptor agonists, inducing the full DDR2 phosphorylation signal.</p>

        <title>DDR1/DDR2 hybrid proteins to analyse determinants for difference in DDR collagen binding specificity</title>
        <p>The data so far show that DDR1 and DDR2 bind fibrillar collagens in a similar manner. However, DDR1 and DDR2 differ in their specificity for binding to the non-fibrillar basement membrane collagen IV. We recently obtained a crystal structure of a complex between the DDR2 DS domain and a triple-helical collagen peptide encompassing the GVMGFO motif (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>). The main collagen binding residues defined by this structure (Trp52, Thr56, Asp69, Arg105, Glu113, and Cys73-Cys177 disulfide bridge) are strictly conserved in the homologous DDR1 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), consistent with the binding of both DDRs to GVMGFO-containing peptides, as shown in <xref rid="f0010 f0015 f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2–4</xref>. We previously noted that several DDR residues at the periphery of the GVMGFO peptide-binding interface are not conserved, and speculated that these residues may be responsible for the distinct collagen binding specificity of the two DDRs (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>). In order to test this hypothesis, we created DDR2–DDR1 hybrid constructs, in which these non-conserved amino acid residues were replaced in DDR2 with the corresponding DDR1 amino acids (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Three DDR2 constructs were obtained: one in which two residues in loop 4 of DDR2 were replaced by DDR1 amino acids (DDR2-H1), one in which three loop 6 residues were replaced by corresponding DDR1 residues (DDR2-H2), and a third construct that combined the mutations of the former constructs (DDR2-H3). All three constructs were made as the DDR2-Fc versions and tested for their ability to bind to collagen IV. Wild-type DDR2-Fc, as expected, showed no collagen IV binding (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A). The two hybrid constructs DDR2-H1 and DDR2-H2 only showed minimal collagen IV binding (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B and C), indicating that replacing DDR2 amino acids in individual loops 4 or 6 is not sufficient for switching collagen binding specificity. DDR2-H3, on the other hand, showed robust binding to collagen IV (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>D).</p>
        <p>We also introduced the DDR1 amino acids in the context of full-length DDR2, and expressed these hybrid receptors in HEK293 cells. Similar to the binding assays, receptor activation assays showed that DDR2-H3, but not DDR2-H1 or DDR2-H2 could be activated by collagen IV (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that DDR residues outside the GVMGFO collagen binding pocket determine the specificity for collagen IV of the two DDRs.</p>
        <p>DDR2-H3-Fc was used to analyse binding sites on collagens II and III, using the Toolkit peptides, as in <xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 and 3</xref>. Results with Toolkit II (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>A) showed a binding pattern that resembled both DDR1 and DDR2, in that peptides, II-5, II-13, II-22, II-39 and II-44 interacted with DDR2-H3, as shown for wild-type DDR2 in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B. Binding to peptide II-39 seemed increased compared to wild-type DDR2. Interestingly, however, like DDR1, DDR2-H3 did not bind peptide II-23. The Toolkit III results also showed characteristics of both DDR1 and DDR2 (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>B). Like wild-type DDR2, DDR2-H3 bound strongly to peptides III-5 and III-23. While peptide III-44 was still recognised, binding seemed to be diminished compared to wild-type DDR2. Like DDR1, DDR2-H3 lacked the ability to bind to III-39.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report a comprehensive analysis of binding sites for DDR1 and DDR2 on the fibrillar collagens II and III. The homologous DDRs both recognised, with precisely the same amino acid requirements, a GVMGFO motif present in the two collagens. Similar to what we reported previously for DDR2 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>), peptides encompassing the GVMGFO motif were able to act as functional DDR1 ligands by inducing receptor autophosphorylation. Apart from GVMGFO-containing peptides, DDR2 bound a greater number of Toolkit peptides than DDR1. However, these additional binding peptides were not able to act as receptor agonists like the GVMGFO-containing peptides. The DDRs differ in their specificity for non-fibrillar collagens. Here we define the molecular basis for the exclusive recognition of the non-fibrillar collagen IV by DDR1: five non-conserved amino acids present on DDR1 loop regions in proximity to the GVMGFO binding pocket are determinants for collagen IV binding.</p>
      <p>There is ample evidence that the cartilage-specific collagen II is a physiological ligand for DDR2: DDR2 is expressed in cartilage, is present on chondrocytes, and loss of DDR2 function leads to severe growth defects in humans and mice (<xref rid="bb0015 bb0025 bb0090 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2010; Bargal et al., 2009; Kano et al., 2008; Labrador et al., 2001</xref>). Whether collagen II is a physiological ligand for DDR1 is less clear, but DDR1 expression has been reported in chondrocytes in normal articular cartilage (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Zeggini et al., 2004</xref>). It is thus conceivable that DDR1 might come into contact with collagen II. We previously reported low binding of DDR1 to collagen II, and low level of DDR1 activation by collagen II, compared to collagen II-induced DDR2 activation, concluding that DDR2 rather than DDR1 was a physiological collagen II receptor (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger et al., 2004</xref>). Collagen III has been reported to be a ligand for both DDRs (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). Here we used recombinant human collagen III, to avoid potential contamination with collagen I that is found in many commercial collagen III preparations. We found strong binding of DDR2 to collagen III, with similar signal strength as its binding to collagens I and II (<xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, 3</xref> and data not shown), but the DDR1 ectodomain bound immobilized collagen III poorly (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and data not shown). However, when expressed as full-length receptors in cells, both DDRs could be activated by collagen III added in solution (Supplementary Fig. 4), consistent with collagen III being a ligand for both DDRs.</p>
      <p>The Collagen Toolkit peptides have been used in several studies for mapping ligand binding sites on the collagens II and III. Thus, binding sites for von Willebrand factor (VWF) (on collagen III), α2β1 integrin (collagen III), glycoprotein VI (collagen III), and the Ieukocyte associated Ig-like receptors LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 (on collagens II and III) were identified (<xref rid="bb0085 bb0115 bb0140 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis et al., 2008; Lebbink et al., 2009; Lisman et al., 2006; Raynal et al., 2006</xref>). With the exception of VWF, whose interaction with collagen III displayed exquisite specificity by binding only a single Collagen III Toolkit peptide, III-23 (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Lisman et al., 2006</xref>), all other collagen binding proteins bound to several Toolkit peptides. Most of the DDR binding peptides have not been identified as binding to other collagen binding proteins. For example, none of the seven Collagen II Toolkit peptides that bind DDR1 or DDR2 was found to interact with LAIR-1 or LAIR-2 (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lebbink et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, none of the four Collagen III Toolkit peptides that bind DDR2 binds to either glycoprotein VI (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis et al., 2008</xref>) or integrin α2β1 (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Raynal et al., 2006</xref>). Peptides III-5 and III-44, which showed robust binding to DDR2 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), displayed modest binding to LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lebbink et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The DDRs do, however, share an overlapping binding site with other, structurally unrelated collagen binding proteins. The GVMGFO motif present in Toolkit peptides II-22, II-23 and III-23 (and conserved in the α1 chain of collagen I, as discussed previously (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>)) is also recognised by VWF (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Lisman et al., 2006</xref>) and the matricellular protein SPARC (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Giudici et al., 2008</xref>). While the DDRs bind this motif with an essentially identical collagen binding mode as SPARC (<xref rid="bb0040 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009; Hohenester et al., 2008</xref>), the collagen amino acid requirements for VWF binding are different (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Lisman et al., 2006</xref>), indicating a distinct binding mode. Recently, the GVMGFO motif was also shown to interact with a mosquito salivary protein, aegyptin (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Calvo et al., 2010</xref>). The latter interaction, however, differs from the mammalian proteins’ interaction in that it was independent of triple-helical conformation.</p>
      <p>The two homologous DDRs share a common overall architecture. Their DS domains are 59% identical in amino acid sequence, with striking conservation of amino acids in the surface-exposed collagen binding loops. The key collagen binding residues in DDR2, delineated by NMR on the isolated DS domain (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>) as well as by X-ray crystallography of the DDR2 DS domain in complex with a triple-helical peptide encompassing the GVMGFO motif (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>), are all strictly conserved in DDR1 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These findings are consistent with our data presented here that DDR1 binds the GVMGFO motif with the same collagen amino acid requirements as DDR2 (<xref rid="f0020 f0025" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 and 5</xref>). However, despite the conservation of key collagen binding amino acids, we show here that the DDRs differ in their ability to bind Collagen Toolkit peptides. DDR2 displayed robust binding to several peptides on both Collagen II and III Toolkits, while DDR1 binding was restricted mostly to GVMGFO-containing peptides (<xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 and 3</xref>). While both DDRs are widely expressed in several organs of the body, a key difference is that DDR1 is mainly found on epithelial cells while DDR2 is found on stromal cells of mesenchymal origin (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 1995</xref>). Our finding that DDR1 binding to fibrillar collagens is more restricted than that of DDR2 could indicate that DDR1 is mainly a receptor for collagen IV in basement membranes underlying epithelial cell sheets.</p>
      <p>Even though DDR1 bound strongly to peptides encompassing the GVMGFO motif present in collagens II and III, we found low binding of DDR1 to full-length collagens II and III. This was not due to poor immobilization of the collagens to the plate, as DDR2 gave strong binding signals to the same collagens. However, it is conceivable that full-length collagens immobilize in such a way that the hydrophobic GVMGFO motif is not or poorly accessible, thus giving low DDR1 binding signals, as DDR1 would bind collagens II and III chiefly through the GVMGFO motif. DDR2, on the other hand, would give strong binding to collagen II and III in this scenario, if its additional binding sites are not masked by plate immobilization.</p>
      <p>The DDR2 binding peptide sequences of the Collagen III Toolkit, III-5, III-39 and III-44, are unique to collagen III and not conserved in collagen I (α1 chain) or collagen II, while the DDR2 binding peptides of the Collagen II Toolkit, II-13 and II-44, are conserved in the α1 chain of collagen I, as discussed in our previous study (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>). Inspection of Toolkit peptide sequences that interact strongly with DDR2 (II-13, II-44, III-5, III-39 and III-44) does not reveal the presence of obvious candidate motifs analogous to the GVMGFO motif. This, combined with the fact that DDR1 does not bind to these peptides and that these peptides are not able to induce strong DDR2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggests that alternative modes exist for recognition of fibrillar collagen by the DDRs. It is conceivable that the interaction of DDR2 with some of these peptides stabilises an inactive DDR2 conformation. Further studies are required to define the amino acid motifs contained in these peptides and the binding mode.</p>
      <p>In addition to their distinct binding specificity towards fibrillar collagen motifs revealed in the present study, a key difference in collagen binding specificity of the DDRs is that only DDR1, but not DDR2, is a receptor for collagen IV (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 1997; Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). We show here that, as predicted from our structural analysis (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>), five solvent-exposed amino acids present in two loop regions adjacent to, but outside, the DDR collagen (GVMGFO) binding interface are largely responsible for collagen IV binding in DDR1 (<xref rid="f0040 f0045" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8 and 9</xref>). Replacement of DDR2 amino acids with corresponding DDR1 substitutions in individual loops (L4 or L6, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) was not sufficient for inducing collagen IV binding in DDR2, but the combined substitutions of L4 and L6 amino acids resulted in binding of collagen IV to the DDR2-H3 ectodomain and in collagen IV-induced DDR2-H3 receptor autophosphorylation. These results indicate that the contacts of DDR1 with collagen IV involve both L4 and L6 residues.</p>
      <p>DDR1 binding motifs in collagen IV are unknown at present. Because collagen IV has 6 different α chains that form 3 distinct heterotrimers, mapping of DDR1 binding sites by peptide libraries is made difficult because of technical challenges involved in the synthesis of the required peptides. Based on the crystal structure of SPARC in complex with a GVMGFO-containing peptide (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Hohenester et al., 2008</xref>), predictions of putative SPARC binding sites with similarities to the GVMGFO motif were made in the [α1(IV)]<sub>2</sub>α2(IV) heterotrimer (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Hohenester et al., 2008</xref>). Assuming that DDR1 shares the same binding mode with regards to collagen IV binding, four putative GFO-containing binding sites for DDR1 can be identified (for details see (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Hohenester et al., 2008</xref>). However, further studies are needed to understand the DDR1–collagen IV interaction in more detail. In addition to its collagen IV-binding ability, the DDR2-H3 construct shared some DDR1 characteristics regarding binding to the Toolkit peptides, suggesting that the specificity for fibrillar collagen motifs other than GVMGFO is determined by DDR amino acids at the periphery of the GVMGFO peptide-binding interface.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis using Toolkit peptides has defined binding motifs for both DDRs on the fibrillar collagens II and III. Furthermore, we determined the molecular basis for the specificity of collagen IV recognition by DDR1.</p>

        <p>The assay was done as previously described (<xref rid="bb0100 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Konitsiotis et al., 2008; Leitinger, 2003</xref>). Briefly, collagens or collagen peptides were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl or in 0.01 M acetic acid, respectively. They were then coated onto Immulon 2HB 96-well plates (Fisher Scientific) overnight at room temperature. Wells were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (for DDR2 proteins) or with 0.05 mg/ml κ-casein (for DDR1 proteins) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween-20. Recombinant Fc-tagged DDR proteins, diluted in incubation buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (for DDR2) or 0.05 mg/ml κ-casein (for DDR1) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20), were added for 3 h at room temperature. Wells were washed six times with incubation buffer afterwards. Bound Fc-tagged DDR proteins were then detected with goat-anti-human Fc coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:3333 dilution), added for 1 h at room temperature followed by six washes. A color reaction was subsequently performed using <italic>o</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), added for 3–5 min. The reaction was stopped with 3 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and plates were read at 492 nm on a 96-well plate reader.</p>

        <title>Collagen-induced DDR autophosphorylation</title>
        <p>The assay was performed as described before (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Leitinger, 2003</xref>). Briefly, HEK293 cells in 24-well plates were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with the stated DDR expression vectors. 24 h later, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with collagen I (at 10 μg/ml), collagen III (at 10 μg/ml), collagen IV (at 50 μg/ml), or different collagen peptides (at 100–500 μg/ml) for 90 min, at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mM NaF. Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The duplicate blots were probed with either anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody or polyclonal anti-DDR2 (or DDR1) antibodies followed by corresponding horseradish peroxidise-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was performed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus (Amersham Biosciences) on an Ettan DIGE Imager (GE Healthcare Biosciences).</p>

        <p>Schematic representation of recombinant DDR-Fc constructs. The DDR extracellular domains contain an N-terminal DS domain that contains the collagen binding site, followed by a so-called stalk region. Fc-tagged proteins are fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG1 or IgG2, as indicated, with the Fc sequences (and linker amino acids) added after the last amino acid of the DDR ectodomains (T416 for DDR1, T398 for DDR2). The new constructs are shown on the right, and contain a three amino acid linker (Ala-Ala-Ala), symbolized by a triangle, between the DDR ectodomains and the IgG2 Fc sequence.</p>

        <p>Identification of DDR1 and DDR2 binding sites on collagen II. Binding of recombinant DDR1-Fc2 or DDR2-Fc to immobilized collagen II Toolkit peptides in a solid phase binding assay. Recombinant DDR-Fc proteins were added for 3 h at room temperature to 96 wells coated with collagen or peptides at 10 μg/ml. Bound proteins were detected with anti-Fc antibodies and measured as absorbance at 492 nm. (A) Binding of DDR1-Fc2, added at 20 μg/ml (220 nM). (B) Binding of DDR2-Fc, added at 10 μg/ml (110 nM). Shown are the mean +/− SD of three to four independent experiments, each performed in triplicates. CI: rat tail collagen I; CII: bovine collagen II; Cas: casein; GPP and CRP: peptides without specific collagen sequences. GPP: (GPP)<sub>10</sub>; CRP: (GPO)<sub>10</sub>.</p>
