        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>T cell fate is associated with mutually exclusive expression of CD4 or CD8 in helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. How expression of one locus is temporally coordinated with repression of the other has been a long-standing enigma, though we know RUNX transcription factors activate the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus, silence the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus, and repress the <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> locus (encoding the transcription factor ThPOK), which is required for CD4 expression. Here we found that nuclear organization was altered by interplay among members of this transcription factor circuitry: RUNX binding mediated association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> whereas ThPOK binding kept the loci apart. Moreover, targeted deletions within <italic>Cd4</italic> modulated CD8 expression and pericentromeric repositioning of <italic>Cd8.</italic> Communication between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> thus appears to enable long-range epigenetic regulation to ensure that expression of one excludes the other in mature CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell fate is determined by complex patterns of gene expression that are often mediated by a surprisingly limited number of transcription factors. Within a particular lineage, key factors can both upregulate and repress the expression of different target genes, which can number in the hundreds and be scattered throughout the genome. How are these activities coordinated? Given that tissue-specific expression profiles can be accompanied by tissue-specific patterns of locus conformation (<xref rid="bib36 bib39 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Roldán et al., 2005; Sayegh et al., 2005; Skok et al., 2007</xref>) or nuclear location (near the nuclear periphery, pericentromeric heterochromatin [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1999</xref>], or within a chromosome territory [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chambeyron and Bickmore, 2004</xref>]), it is reasonable to ask whether higher-order nuclear organization might be involved in coordinating this simultaneous expression and repression.</p>
      <p>Lymphocyte development provides an attractive model system for investigating whether there is a correlation between cell fate decisions and the spatial organization of the nucleus, because developmental stages and effector cell functions are clearly differentiated by the expression of cell surface glycoproteins that mark lineage commitment (and transcription of whose loci must therefore be carefully orchestrated). T lymphocytes express both CD4 and CD8 during development, but mature helper T cells express only CD4 protein while mature cytotoxic T cells express only CD8 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kioussis and Ellmeier, 2002</xref>). Both populations of T cells arise from common thymic precursors that are propelled through a series of developmental stages by recombination of variable, diversity, and joining gene segments (V(D)J) that eventually form a unique antigen receptor. Recombination begins at the earliest stage of development in double-negative (DN) thymocytes, which express neither CD4 nor CD8. Productive V(D)J rearrangement of one allele leads to assembly and expression of the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) on the surface of the cell; signaling through the pre-TCR promotes differentiation to the double-positive (DP) stage, in which the cells express both CD4 and CD8. DP cells then enter a transitional stage during which CD8 expression diminishes (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup>) before finally becoming either CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (sometimes referred to as CD4 or CD8 single-positive [SP] cells, respectively). The CD4 and CD8 coreceptors are regulated to ensure mutually exclusive expression (and complementary repression).</p>
      <p>How is this coregulation achieved? Two lines of evidence led us to suspect that nuclear organization might play a role. First, it is increasingly apparent that transcriptional status is related to chromosomal positioning (<xref rid="bib7 bib22 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Chubb et al., 2006; Iborra et al., 1996; Osborne et al., 2004; Ragoczy et al., 2006</xref>). Second, members of the RUNX family of transcription factors are important in governing cell fate decisions in developing T lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2009</xref>)—and they are known to have a role in nuclear organization as well (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2007</xref>). RUNX1 and RUNX3, which are expressed at different stages of T cell development, both activate and repress expression of the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci in a complementary fashion. How such exquisite control is achieved, however, has been difficult to ascertain with molecular genetic and biochemical approaches.</p>
      <p>To test the notion that higher-order nuclear organization might facilitate epigenetic regulation of these loci, we used 3-dimensional DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the interplay between the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci during T cell development in wild-type mice and a variety of mutant lines.</p>

        <title><italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> Associate with One Another in CD8-Expressing Murine Cells</title>
        <p><italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> are located on chromosome 6 in the mouse, separated by a distance of 53.3 megabases (Mb). We used the two BAC probes RP23-121J20 and RP23-139M18, which cover the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci, respectively, to follow the nuclear localization of these loci during T cell development (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). 3D DNA FISH and confocal microscopy were carried out as previously described (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Roldán et al., 2005</xref>) in sorted thymocyte populations from wild-type mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). It is important to point out that, in our analyses, we sorted cells in different stages of thymocyte development by expression of CD4 and CD8 as well as a number of other developmental markers (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C). We measured the distance between the center of mass of the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> signals in individual cells by using Image J software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Interallelic distances were displayed as cumulative frequency curves. A left shift in the cumulative frequency curve indicates closer distances, as shown by the distribution. The statistical significance of the difference between distributions was calculated by the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Two controls were used for these experiments: we measured the distance between these same loci in a different cell type, namely B cells, and we measured the distance between two different loci, <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic>, which are also located on chromosome 6 and separated by a similar distance (52.9 Mb) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A). We observed significantly reduced association between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles in splenic B cells compared to DP cells (p = 1.67e-11) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). To examine the control loci <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic>, we used the two BAC probes RP24-365F23 and RP23-148M10, respectively (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A). Association between <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> was significantly lower than between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> in DP cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B; p = 2.44e-10). We used the distribution of the frequency of association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> in a control cell type (splenic B cells) and of <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> in DP cells to provide the background measurement of association against which the distribution in developing thymocytes could be compared.</p>
        <p>At the earliest (DN) stage of development, when T cells express neither CD4 nor CD8, we found significantly decreased association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> compared to DP T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C; p = 3.37e-14). As DP cells differentiate to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> transitional stage, the loci dissociated somewhat (p = 3.12e-07), but <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> achieved close association again in CD8 SP cells. In CD4 SP thymocytes, the two loci moved farther apart than in the transitional CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> stage and were significantly more separated compared to CD8 SP cells (p = 1.43e-10). <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> association therefore correlated well with CD8 expression, whether the cells were isolated from thymus, peripheral spleen, or lymph node (data not shown).</p>
        <p>In the same subsets of sorted thymocytes, we examined the positions of the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH), a repressive subcompartment of the nucleus. This was carried out as described previously (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Merkenschlager et al., 2004</xref>), with a labeled γ-satellite repeat probe to identify PCH regions. Association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> was scored if the signals were juxtaposed or overlapping with PCH. At the DN stage, approximately 50% of <italic>Cd4</italic> and 30% of <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles were associated with PCH (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). In DP cells, which express both proteins, ∼25% of <italic>Cd4</italic> and ∼35% of <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles were located at PCH. In CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP cells, a large proportion of <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles were repositioned to PCH (up to 70%), consistent with its diminished expression. Likewise, in CD8 SP cells, ∼65% of <italic>Cd4</italic> alleles were repositioned to pericentromeric regions.</p>
        <p>Taken together these data indicate that <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> associate specifically in T lineage cells (in contrast to B cells) and that the greatest degree of close interaction occurs in DP and CD8 SP cells. Furthermore, in agreement with what has been published, we found that repositioning of each locus to PCH inversely correlated with the expression of the coreceptor at that developmental stage (<xref rid="bib10 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Delaire et al., 2004; Merkenschlager et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> Association Occurs Predominantly in <italic>cis</italic></title>
        <p>The association we observed between the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci could be occurring either in <italic>cis</italic> (between the two alleles on the same chromosome) or in <italic>trans</italic> (between the two alleles on separate chromosomes). To determine which is the case, we measured the distance between the two chromosome territories and analyzed whether <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> were positioned closer on the same, or different, chromosomes in DP and CD8 SP sorted T cells. We used a chromosome paint that hybridizes to chromosome 6 in addition to the two BAC probes RP23-121J20 and RP23-139M18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). In 40%–60% of DP or CD8 SP cells, the two chromosome 6 territories were separated by &gt;1 μm, indicating that any interaction between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> was occurring predominantly in <italic>cis</italic> on the same chromosome. Even when the two territories were separated by &lt;1 μm, it was still possible to assign each <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> locus to its respective chromosome territory in most cells. In only a small population of cells (10% of DP cells and 2% of CD8 SP cells) was it difficult to determine which territory the loci belonged to and whether <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> were closer on the same or different chromosomes. Thus, interaction between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> occurs predominantly between loci located on the same chromosome.</p>

        <title>The E8<sub>I</sub> and E8<sub>II</sub> Enhancers Promote <italic>Cd8</italic> Transcription and <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> Association</title>
        <p>Having established that <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association occurs in <italic>Cd8</italic>-expressing cells, we turned our attention to regulatory elements in the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus to determine how <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription affects the relationship between the two loci. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express a heterodimer of CD8α and CD8β chains that are governed by at least five enhancer elements (E8<sub>I</sub> to E8<sub>V</sub>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A) that drive expression of CD8α and CD8β in a developmentally regulated manner (<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 1997, 1998; Hostert et al., 1997, 1998</xref>), although genetic analysis of these enhancer elements indicates overlapping and redundant roles in regulating CD8 expression. We first made use of mice lacking the E8<sub>I</sub> enhancer (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 1998</xref>), which is active in CD8 SP thymocytes but not DP cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 1997</xref>). The location of <italic>Cd8</italic> enhancers within the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus is shown in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A. DNA FISH and confocal microscopy analysis of sorted thymocyte populations from E8<sub>I</sub>-deficient mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B) showed wild-type levels of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association in DP thymocytes (data not shown) but reduced association in CD8 SP cells (p = 7.19e-06 compared to wild-type CD8 SP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Consistent with this finding, <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription was decreased in E8<sub>I</sub>-deficient CD8 SP cells but not DP cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) and surface CD8 expression in all E8<sub>I</sub>-deficient thymocyte subsets was 25% lower than in wild-type (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 1998</xref>). These data are consistent with the notion that <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription promotes association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci, but it is also possible that E8<sub>I</sub> mediates the association by recruiting factors to the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus that promote its interaction with <italic>Cd4</italic> in CD8 SP cells.</p>
        <p>To explore this further, we took advantage of the variegated CD8 expression in mice doubly deficient for E8<sub>I</sub> and E8<sub>II</sub> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 2002</xref>). These mice lose expression of CD8 in approximately one-third of their DP stage thymocytes while retaining wild-type amounts of surface expression in the remaining two-thirds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ellmeier et al., 2002</xref>). By gating on these populations, we were able to sort E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells that are CD8-expressing and E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells that have reduced CD8 expression (referred to here as CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> and CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells, respectively; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C). DNA FISH and confocal microscopy showed decreasing amounts of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association with reduced CD8 expression: CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells showed significantly less <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association than did wild-type (p = 9.13e-05) and CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells showed even lower levels of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association (p = 3.33e-08 compared to wild-type) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Consistent with these results, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription was lower than wild-type in CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> and almost abolished in CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Repositioning of <italic>Cd8</italic> to PCH was probably affected both by deletion of these enhancer elements and by the reduction in transcription. We observed increased positioning of <italic>Cd8</italic> to PCH in the CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells; about 52% of the double-mutant cells had at least one allele associated with PCH in CD8<sup>+</sup> DP, versus 35% in wild-type DP cells. This repositioning was even greater (65%) in CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells (p = 2.60e-02 for CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP compared to wild-type; p = 6.90e-07 for CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP compared to wild-type; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). Pericentromeric localization of <italic>Cd8</italic> correlates with epigenetic differences between CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP because the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus in the CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells has an epigenetic “off” state (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bilic et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Decreased <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription therefore correlates with diminished association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> and increased repositioning of <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles to PCH. It is not clear, however, whether <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription is a cause or a consequence of the euchromatic location of <italic>Cd8</italic> and the increased association of <italic>Cd4-Cd8.</italic> Both of these effects could be mediated by the presence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors recruited to the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus by E8<sub>I</sub> and E8<sub>II</sub>.</p>

        <title><italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> Association Requires the RUNX Binding Partner CBFβ</title>
        <p>To determine whether <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins are involved in mediating the <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association, we focused on members of the RUNX family, which are known to bind both the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci and have an important role in governing cell fate decisions in developing T lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2009</xref>). RUNX1 and RUNX3 are expressed at different stages of T cell development: RUNX1 binds the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer element in DN cells to suppress <italic>Cd4</italic> expression (<xref rid="bib47 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Taniuchi et al., 2002a; Zou et al., 2001</xref>), and loss of RUNX1 or CBFβ (which stabilizes the interaction of RUNX proteins with DNA) or deletion of the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer allows <italic>Cd4</italic> expression in DN cells (<xref rid="bib27 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2001; Taniuchi et al., 2002b</xref>). RUNX3 expression is activated at later stages of T cell development, and in addition to binding to the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer to prevent <italic>Cd4</italic> derepression, it has a crucial role in activating <italic>Cd8</italic> expression in transitional CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD8 SP cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Egawa et al., 2007</xref>). RUNX proteins bind along the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus, most prominently to E8<sub>I</sub> (specifically in CD8 SP cells) and to E8<sub>II</sub> in DP cells as well as E8<sub>IV</sub> in all thymocytes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, RUNX1 and RUNX3 simultaneously regulate expression of the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci in an opposite manner.</p>
        <p>To test the hypothesis that RUNX proteins are involved in bringing the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci together, we used conditional <italic>Cbfb</italic>-deleted mice in which the gene encoding CBFβ, the requisite heterodimeric binding partner of all RUNX proteins, is conditionally deleted in all thymocytes from the DN stage onward by crossing to <italic>Lck-cre</italic> mice, which permits transition to the DP stage but results in blocked T cell development beyond the DP stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Egawa et al., 2007</xref>). Our DNA FISH and confocal analyses of sorted thymocyte populations from CBFβ-deficient mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>) revealed that <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> come into close contact at a lower frequency in DP cells from these mice (p = 5.35e-07; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C).

        <title>ThPOK Inhibits the Association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic></title>
        <p>The zinc finger transcription factor ThPOK, which has been shown to be required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage commitment (<xref rid="bib17 bib46" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2005</xref>), binds to the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer to prevent CD4 silencing in CD4-fated thymocytes (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Muroi et al., 2008</xref>). In CD4-fated cells, ThPOK expression is increased from the basal post-positive selection level, and ThPOK binds to both the <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> (gene encoding ThPOK) silencer and the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer, where it is thought to antagonize RUNX function and prevent the <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> and <italic>Cd4</italic> loci from being silenced (<xref rid="bib32 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Muroi et al., 2008; Wildt et al., 2007</xref>). ThPOK has also been implicated in repressing <italic>Cd8</italic> expression (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson et al., 2007</xref>), and peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells transduced with a retroviral vector expressing <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> have significantly lower <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription than either empty vector-transduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or those transduced with a <italic>Zbtb7b</italic> retrovirus carrying the HD mutation (which leads to a defect in the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dave et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, ThPOK-deficient mice show increased expression of RUNX3 in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> transitional cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Egawa and Littman, 2008</xref>), which could exert an effect on <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association.</p>
        <p>We generated <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>A–S4D), sorted the few remaining CD4 SP thymocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>E), and used a RUNX3-specific antibody for immunofluorescence. Wild-type CD4 SP cells expressed very little RUNX3 protein compared to wild-type CD8 SP cells, but <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> CD4 SP cells expressed levels of RUNX3 equivalent to wild-type CD8 SP cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). The increase in RUNX3 expression in CD4 SP cells from <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> mice significantly increased interaction between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> (p = 3.15e-03 compared to wild-type CD4 SP cells) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Furthermore, we observed a significant rise in the percentage of <italic>Cd4</italic> alleles positioned at PCH (from 40% in wild-type CD4 SP cells to almost 70% in <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> CD4 SP cells, p = 1.14e-05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). In line with our previous observations, the increased frequency in <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> association was accompanied by an increase in <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). These data suggest that one of the functions of ThPOK could be to inhibit the reassociation of the <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci in CD4-fated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP thymocytes, thereby preventing <italic>Cd4</italic> silencing.</p>
        <p>To test the idea that ThPOK could separate <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic>, we compared the frequency of association of these loci in DP cells from wild-type and ThPOK transgenic mice (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). These mice express a wild-type form of the protein by using human CD2-based regulatory elements that drive expression as early as the DP stage of development (where the endogenous locus is not normally transcribed). Although the presence of the transgene does not substantially alter the total number of thymocytes, it directs cells toward the CD4 lineage and impairs CD8 development; there are virtually no CD8 SP cells in these mice (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). We found a significant decrease in the frequency of <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> association in DP cells where ThPOK is prematurely expressed (p = 1.40e-08) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G and for sort strategy see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>F). Together these experiments indicate that ThPOK negatively regulates association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> as well as commitment to the CD8 lineage.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Cd4</italic> Proximal Enhancer Inhibits <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> Association after Positive Selection</title>
        <p>The experiments we have described above indicate that the transcription factor RUNX could bring <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> together to streamline their regulation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref>). It is also possible that <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> could exert a more direct influence over each other. If so, alterations of key regulatory elements within the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus would translate into changes in <italic>Cd8</italic> regulation. To address this question, we made use of gene-targeted mice. <italic>Cd4</italic> expression is regulated by a silencer element and at least one stage-specific enhancer element (<xref rid="bib6 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2010; Kioussis and Ellmeier, 2002</xref>). The proximal enhancer <italic>Cd4</italic> PE, located 13 Kb upstream of the <italic>Cd4</italic> start site, is absolutely required for transcription, and therefore expression, of <italic>Cd4</italic> in DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2010</xref>). The position of this enhancer is diagrammed in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A. After positive selection in <italic>Cd4</italic> proximal enhancer (PE)-deficient mice, CD4-expressing single-positive thymocytes and CD4<sup>+</sup> peripheral T cells were detected, albeit at reduced numbers, and levels of CD4 expression were comparable to wild-type mice, suggesting that one or more putative enhancer elements rescue <italic>Cd4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A and data not shown). DNA FISH and confocal microscopy analysis of sorted thymocyte populations from <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B) revealed that the <italic>Cd4</italic> PE, and therefore <italic>Cd4</italic> transcription, is not required for either the <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association at the DP stage or for the repositioning away from PCH, because the degree of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association and pericentromeric localization were comparable to wild-type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B–5D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast to wild-type cells, however, <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association in <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient mice occurred at a higher frequency in DN cells (p = 2.28e-07 compared to wild-type controls) and remained high in both CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP cells after positive selection (p = 3.20e-03 and p = 6.75e-05 for CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP cells, respectively, compared to the appropriate wild-type controls) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Deletion of the <italic>Cd4</italic> PE also increased the frequency with which the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus relocated to PCH beyond the DP stage; in both CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP cells from <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient mice, <italic>Cd4</italic> association with PCH reached the same levels as in CD8 SP cells (59% in <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient cells compared to 36% in wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, p = 5.26e-03; 58% in <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient cells compared to 39% in wild-type CD4 SP cells, p = 1.15e-02; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>). In order to correlate these positional changes with the transcriptional state of each locus, we set aside a subset of each sorted thymocyte population for real-time RT-PCR analysis. <italic>Cd4</italic> transcription was virtually abolished in DP cells from <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient mice (data not shown) and substantially reduced in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD4 SP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E), consistent with the surface expression of CD4 on these thymocyte subsets. These data demonstrate that <italic>Cd4</italic> transcription is not required for <italic>Cd4</italic> to associate with <italic>Cd8</italic> at the DP stage and further suggest that, in the absence of robust transcription after positive selection, the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus remains associated with the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus. <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> pairs were more frequently located at PCH, with <italic>Cd4</italic> positioned close to these regions, whereas <italic>Cd8</italic> remained euchromatic, i.e., the two loci were not equivalently associated with this repressive compartment. Furthermore, <italic>Cd8</italic> expression was slightly increased in DP and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells. These results are consistent with results in wild-type cells above: association of the two loci correlates with CD8 expression.</p>

        <p>DNA FISH was performed on sorted thymocyte populations from wild-type and <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>B) as described previously, and cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Surprisingly, the <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association in <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient DP cells did not increase beyond the level observed in the DN thymocyte population and remained low at all subsequent stages of development (p = 5.48e-13 in DP cells, p = 3.51e-03 in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, and p = 2.62e-07 in CD8 SP cells, compared to the appropriate wild-type controls; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Confocal sections showing decreased association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> in DP and CD8 SP cells from <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient mice are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C. These data indicate that the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer region is required to mediate the close association of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> in both DP and CD8 SP thymocytes.</p>
        <p>Absence of the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer did not appear to affect localization of <italic>Cd4</italic> at PCH, but, surprisingly, <italic>Cd8</italic> alleles were significantly repositioned to PCH at the DP stage (51% in <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient cells compared to 32% in wild-type DP cells, p = 5.00e-03) and subsequent stages of development, most notably in CD8 SP cells (60% in <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient cells compared to 45% in wild-type CD8 SP cells, p = 3.26e-03; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S5</xref>). Loss of a regulatory element on the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus thus results in a long-range epigenetic effect on the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus.

If colocalization serves an important role in coordinating the expression of these coreceptors, we would expect that the two loci should be associated more frequently in CD8-expressing T cells.

First, we observed that <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> closely associated only in wild-type thymocytes that express CD8 (DP and CD8 SP, but not DN, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup>, or CD4 SP). Second, where <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association was decreased (i.e., in CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>lo</sup> E8<sub>I</sub>E8<sub>II</sub> double-mutant DP cells, E8<sub>I</sub>-deficient CD8 SP cells, and <italic>Cd4</italic> sil-deficient DP and CD8 SP cells), <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription was also decreased to varying degrees. Third, when there was prolonged association between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> (in <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells, <italic>Cd4</italic> PE-deficient CD4 SP cells, and <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> CD4 SP cells), <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription increased. Thus, the loss of a regulatory element (<italic>Cd4</italic> PE) in one locus (<italic>Cd4</italic>) can influence the transcriptional status of a distant locus (<italic>Cd8</italic>), presumably through their physical association. Similarly, loss of the <italic>Cd4</italic> sil on the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus exerts an influence on the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus, increasing the frequency with which the latter is positioned at PCH.</p>
      <p>Beyond elucidating the genetic requirements for <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association, we also wanted to gain insight into whether transcription factors known to be involved in T cell lineage commitment could be involved in mediating the association between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic>. For this, we made use of mice with a conditional <italic>Cbfb</italic><sup>F/F</sup> allele crossed to <italic>Lck-cre</italic> to delete CBFβ at the early DN stage. We found that <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association was substantially reduced in the CBFβ-deficient DP cells, despite equivalent levels of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription, suggesting that association of the two loci could occur at sites where RUNX is enriched in the nucleus. Loss of ThPOK leads to elevated expression of RUNX3 in CD4-fated thymocytes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Egawa and Littman, 2008</xref>), and overexpression of ThPOK in peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells decreases CD8 expression. We therefore predicted that loss of ThPOK might prolong the <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association in CD4 SP cells from <italic>Zbtb7b</italic><sup>hd/hd</sup> mice. This is indeed what we observed, indicating that binding of ThPOK to the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus could be a mechanism for keeping the two loci separate. Furthermore, the loss of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association in these cells was accompanied by a substantial increase in the localization of <italic>Cd4</italic> to pericentromeric heterochromatin and a concomitant decrease in <italic>Cd4</italic> transcription. Conversely premature expression of ThPOK in DP cells led to separation of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic>.</p>
      <p>Is association between <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> a cause or consequence of <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription? We believe it may be both, in the same way that changes in location of loci relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin are likely to be both a cause and a consequence of changes in gene activation and repression. As with most epigenetic correlations, this is a chicken-and-egg situation and we cannot pinpoint the initiating event.</p>
      <p>These studies allow us to put forth the following model. The <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> loci come into close proximity in DP thymocytes. After positive selection, all thymocytes pass through a CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>lo</sup> transitional stage in which <italic>Cd8</italic> transcription decreases and it moves to pericentromeric regions, disrupting the <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association. In CD4-fated cells, ThPOK binds to the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer, preventing it from interacting again with the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus. In CD8-fated cells, RUNX3 mediates the reassociation of <italic>Cd4</italic> and <italic>Cd8</italic> by binding to the <italic>Cd4</italic> silencer and the <italic>Cd8</italic> locus, predominantly within E8<sub>I</sub>. Thus, RUNX-mediated <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association silences the <italic>Cd4</italic> locus, repositioning it to repressive pericentromeric heterochromatin.</p>
      <p>Although it has been known for some time that chromosomal interactions can exert an effect on gene expression in <italic>trans</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (transvection) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 1985</xref>) and possibly plants (paramutation) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Stam, 2009</xref>), there are still only a few instances in which association of alleles is known to exert epigenetic control in mammals. Two examples involve the pairing of homologous alleles: X inactivation (<xref rid="bib1 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Bacher et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006</xref>) and allelic exclusion (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt et al., 2009</xref>). Heterologous association between different loci has been noted in developing B cells as well: one <italic>immunoglobulin light chain</italic> (<italic>Igk</italic>) allele transiently associates with one <italic>immunoglobulin heavy chain</italic> (<italic>Igh</italic>) allele at pericentromeric regions, inducing a change in nuclear location and a conformational change within the <italic>Igh</italic> locus to prevent ongoing recombination (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, association of different loci has been shown to occur in T cell subsets: the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus interacts with the <italic>Il4</italic> locus just prior to commitment to either the Th1 or Th2 cell lineage, which express either IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively. The association of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Il4</italic> could facilitate the coordinate regulation of these loci in the differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Spilianakis et al., 2005</xref>) but no <italic>trans</italic> acting factors that could mediate the association have been identified. Clearly this is an underexplored area of epigenetic regulation.</p>
      <p>Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that nuclear architecture plays a dynamic role in regulating gene expression (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fraser and Bickmore, 2007</xref>). That association of <italic>Cd4-Cd8</italic> is conserved in both mouse and humans, despite being located on different chromosomes in the latter, underscores the importance of this mechanism for regulating CD4 and CD8 coreceptor expression. Undoubtedly, a fuller understanding of the mechanism of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Cd8</italic> association will yield insight into how these coreceptors are regulated during T cell development and how long-range chromosomal interactions control gene expression.</p>
