        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>RecX is a small protein that interacts with, and modulates the activity of, RecA protein. In mycobacteria the <italic>recX</italic> gene is located immediately downstream of the <italic>recA</italic> gene, and the coding regions overlap. It has previously been shown that these two genes are co-transcribed in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. In this study we examine the expression of <italic>recX</italic> in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. In addition to being co-transcribed with <italic>recA</italic> from the DNA-damage inducible <italic>recA</italic> promoters, we identify a constitutive <italic>recX</italic> promoter located within the <italic>recA</italic> coding sequence that is strong enough to make a significant contribution to the expression level of <italic>recX</italic> in the absence of DNA damage. Intriguingly, this promoter is inactivated in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> by a critical base change in the −10 promoter motif, which probably accounts for the lower level of expression of <italic>recX</italic> relative to <italic>recA</italic> that we observed in that species. It is possible that this difference in relative expression influences RecA functions including the response to DNA damage of LexA-regulated genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The RecX protein was first identified as being encoded by a small open reading frame downstream of the <italic>recA</italic> gene in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and has since been found to be conserved in many bacterial species.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> The RecA protein is the key protein involved in homologous genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> RecA also plays a central role in regulation of gene expression in response to DNA damage by the repressor LexA via its stimulation of LexA cleavage on binding to regions of single-stranded DNA.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
      <p>A role for RecX as a negative regulator of RecA was initially indicated by data demonstrating that the RecX protein was necessary to overcome the harmful effects of RecA over-expression in bacterial species as diverse as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv <italic>oryzae</italic>.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Subsequently, the RecX protein was shown to inhibit the ATPase, recombinase and co-protease activities of RecA.<xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,10</sup></xref> Detailed studies in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> revealed that RecX acts by binding to the end of the growing RecA filament, thus limiting filament growth and leading to net disassembly.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> RecX is also able to bind within the major helical groove of the RecA filament at high relative concentrations which would block strand-exchange.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Interestingly, in <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>, RecX also acts as a negative regulator of <italic>recA</italic> expression, with deletion of the <italic>recX</italic> gene resulting in constitutive activation of the <italic>recA</italic> promoter and over-expression of RecX suppressing <italic>recA</italic> promoter activity.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In most species studied to date <italic>recX</italic> is found downstream of the <italic>recA</italic> gene, and in a number of cases the two genes are co-transcribed, e.g. in <italic>S. lividans</italic>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> <italic>M. smegmatis</italic><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and <italic>E. coli</italic>.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> However, in <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> pathovars, the genes in the conserved <italic>lexA-recA-recX</italic> loci are each expressed from their own promoter.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Exceptions to the typical <italic>recA-recX</italic> genomic organisation include bacterial species such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> in which the <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>recX</italic> genes are separated on the chromosome by distances as great as 838 kb and 275 kb respectively.<xref rid="bib9 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,17</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In a number of mycobacterial species, as well as a few other bacteria,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> the 5′ part of the <italic>recX</italic> coding sequence overlaps the 3′-region of the <italic>recA</italic> gene. In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> the overlap is 32 bp long, while in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> a 35 bp overlap is present. The difference between the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> sequence and those of the others is equivalent to the loss of a single codon rather than three separate base deletions. Among mycobacteria <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> has the simplest <italic>recA-recX</italic> locus arrangement, with the two genes flanked by genes expressed from the complementary DNA strand. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>recA-recX</italic> is followed by a single gene in the same orientation, termed <italic>Rv2735c</italic>, classified as encoding a conserved hypothetical protein with no known function. A further difference between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> in this region is the presence of an intein in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> but not <italic>M. smegmatis recA</italic><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>; an intein is an intervening sequence that is removed post-translationally in a process termed protein splicing.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The co-transcription of <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>recX</italic> has already been described in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In this study we show that the transcriptional regulation of <italic>recX</italic> in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> differs from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, with <italic>recX</italic> being co-transcribed with <italic>recA</italic> but at the same time possessing its own promoter, the entirety of which is present within the coding region of the preceding <italic>recA</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>RNA preparation and reverse transcription</title>
        <p>The FastRNA<sup>®</sup> Pro Blue Kit (Qbiogene) was used for the isolation of total RNA from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (50–100 ml) grown to OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.6. Contaminating DNA in the RNA preparations was digested using TURBO RNase-free DNase (Ambion), and the RNA was subsequently cleaned up using an RNeasy MiniKit (QIAGEN). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Removal of DNA was confirmed by performing PCR using an aliquot of the DNase-treated RNA as a template. Reverse transcription for qRT-PCR and shorter transcripts used Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the product information. Reverse transcription for long transcripts used QuantiTect Reverse Transcriptase (QIAGEN) according to the product information but with an extended (2 h) 42 °C incubation time. PCR reactions following reverse transcription (RT-PCR) were performed using REDTaq ReadyMix PCR Reaction Mix incorporating REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma–Aldrich) with an initial denaturation step of 95 <sup>°</sup>C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94 <sup>°</sup>C for 1 min, 68 <sup>°</sup>C for 1 min, 72 <sup>°</sup>C for 8 min, then 35 cycles of 94 <sup>°</sup>C for 1 min, 58 <sup>°</sup>C for 1 min, 72 <sup>°</sup>C for 8 min, and a final extension step of 72 <sup>°</sup>C for 20 min.</p>

        <p>RNA ligase-mediated 5′ RACE using the Generacer kit (Version 2.0; Invitrogen) was used to map the transcriptional start site of <italic>recX</italic> according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To facilitate the identification of a transcript start site, which in bacteria carry a 5′-triphosphate,<xref rid="bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> RNA was first treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), which hydrolyses this group to a 5′-monophosphate to which an RNA oligonulceotide can then be ligated. Following this ligation step and reverse transcription, the resulting cDNA was amplified using the Generacer 5′ forward primer and the appropriate gene-specific primers (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The products obtained were cloned into pCR4-Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) and between five and eight clones were sequenced.</p>

        <title>Definition of the <italic>recA</italic> operon</title>
        <p>To define the operon structure of <italic>recA</italic> in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, we assessed co-transcription with the two downstream genes <italic>recX</italic> and Rv2735c by RT-PCR. Initially the presence of RNA spanning each of the pairs of genes <italic>recA</italic>-<italic>recX</italic> and <italic>recX</italic>-Rv2735c was demonstrated by the formation of a product following reverse transcription of RNA isolated from the parental wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain 1424, but not if the RT step was omitted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To investigate if a single transcript including all three genes was formed, two separate primers within <italic>recA</italic> were used in conjunction with one in Rv2735c, and in each case a product was formed by RT-PCR that was dependent on the reverse transcription step (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, <italic>recX</italic> and Rv2735c are at least partially co-transcribed with <italic>recA</italic>.</p>

        <title>Expression in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain</title>
        <p>The mutation in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain consists of deletion of 1259 bp between the two <italic>Pst</italic>I sites within the coding sequence for RecA and insertion of a 1770 bp DNA fragment encoding hygromycin resistance.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> This mutation would be expected to have a polar effect on the expression of downstream genes that are part of an operon with <italic>recA</italic> owing to the presence of a transcriptional terminator within the fragment inserted.<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> Therefore, we evaluated the expression of <italic>recA</italic>, <italic>recX</italic> and Rv2735c in the parental wild-type strain 1424 and the <italic>recA</italic> mutant by quantitative RT-PCR with normalisation to the housekeeping gene <italic>sigA</italic>.</p>
        <p>When a primer set located in the part of the <italic>recA</italic> coding sequence remaining upstream of the deletion was used, there was no significant difference between the two strains in the expression level observed, while, as expected, no expression was detectable in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain when a primer set located in the deleted region was used. The apparent expression level in the wild-type strain appeared to differ between the two primer sets, but this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Students <italic>t</italic>-test). The observed expression level for Rv2735c was at a lower level than <italic>recA</italic> or <italic>recX</italic>. It has been observed previously that downstream genes in an operon are expressed at a lower level than promoter proximal genes, including in actinomycetes.<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32–34</sup></xref> The most significant finding was that expression of <italic>recX</italic> and Rv2735c was still detectable, albeit at a reduced level, in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This raised the possibility that this residual expression might arise from a promoter other than those already characterised upstream of <italic>recA</italic>.</p>
        <p>An alternative explanation could be that the residual expression of <italic>recX</italic> in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain might originate from transcriptional read-through from the <italic>recA</italic> promoters owing to incomplete termination in the hygromycin resistance cassette. To assess this possibility, we compared the ability of RNA isolated from the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain with that from the wild-type parental strain to act as template in RT-PCR reactions when one primer was located in <italic>recA</italic> and the other was in <italic>recX</italic> or Rv2735c. The precise locations of the primers within the <italic>recA</italic>-<italic>recX</italic> sequence are shown in <xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary figure 1</xref> along with other key features. When wild-type RNA was used, we obtained a product of the expected size for each primer pair combination used following reverse transcription, but not if the reverse transcription step was omitted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). However, none of the primer combinations that included a primer located in <italic>recA</italic> yielded an RT-PCR product when RNA isolated from the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain was used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, a product was formed when a primer in <italic>recX</italic> was used in combination with one in Rv2735c (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), demonstrating that the RNA isolated from the mutant strain was capable of being reverse-transcribed into cDNA that could act as a substrate for PCR. Although the binding site for one of the primers used in <italic>recA</italic> would have been removed in the deletion strain, for one of the other primers in <italic>recA</italic> the binding site was upstream of the deletion, while another would bind immediately downstream of the deletion. Therefore, the lack of RT-PCR product formation for these two primer pairs with RNA from the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain argues against both transcriptional read-through from the <italic>recA</italic> promoters and expression originating from a promoter within the hygromycin resistance fragment.</p>

        <title>Localisation of promoter activity</title>
        <p>The results described above suggested that the residual expression of <italic>recX</italic> observed in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain most likely arose from a promoter located in the remaining part of the <italic>recA</italic> gene downstream of the deletion/insertion, although the possibility of a promoter in the hygromycin resistance fragment driving expression was not completely excluded. To distinguish between these possibilities, we made two transcriptional fusions to the reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic>. The first, pPR-Hyg, contained the DNA fragment conferring resistance to hygromycin present in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain and the second, pPRrecX, contained the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> from the end-point of the deletion in the Δ<italic>recA</italic> strain to the beginning of the RecX coding sequence. Following transformation into wild-type H37Rv bacteria, we were surprised to detect promoter activity from both fragments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), although the activity residing within the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> was substantially greater than that from the hygromycin resistance fragment.</p>
        <p>As part of the DNA remaining at the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> in the deletion strain corresponds to the intein, we wanted to know if the promoter in this region was located in the intein-encoding DNA or in the RecA-encoding sequence. We, therefore, subdivided this region and made two further <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter constructs, one pPRrecX-I containing just the intein sequence and the other pPRrecX-R just the RecA sequence. Analysis of these clones in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv clearly demonstrated that the promoter activity resided in the RecA-encoding DNA only (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess if the promoter identified at the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> was DNA damage-inducible, we compared the expression levels obtained from the relevant reporter clones following exposure to the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C (0.02 μg/ml for 24 h) with an unexposed control. The presence or absence of mitomycin C did not alter the expression levels obtained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>recA</italic> P1 promoter contained within pEJ449 used as a positive control was clearly inducible, as previously demonstrated<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the promoter within the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> is constitutive.</p>

        <title>Identification of promoter elements</title>
        <p>In order to confirm the presence of promoters, we sought to identify the promoter elements and then assess the effect of introducing mutations in the −10 regions. To facilitate the identification of promoter elements, we first mapped the transcript start sites by 5′ RACE.</p>
        <p>This revealed that in the reporter clone containing the hygromycin resistance fragment the transcript start site was actually located within vector sequence between the insert and the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene and that the −10 region was located at the junction of the insert and vector. It appears that in constructing this clone, combining vector sequence with very limited homology to the SigA −10 consensus (normally incapable of driving expression of the reporter gene as demonstrated by assays on the empty vector in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with insert sequence with a reasonable match to the SigA −35 consensus created a weak artificial promoter. Thus, the promoter activity apparently originating from the hygromycin resistance fragment is an artefact of cloning, and was not investigated further.</p>
        <p>The transcript start site for <italic>recX</italic> was mapped to the A corresponding to the first base of the ATG initiation codon. Upstream of this, motifs (TTGGCA-N<sub>17</sub>-GATGAT) resembling both the −35 and −10 consensus sequences for SigA (TTGACW-N<sub>17</sub>-TATAMT) were identifiable at the appropriate locations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). To confirm that the promoter had been correctly identified, we introduced a mutation in the −10 motif, changing the central ATGA to CGTC in pJD01. When assayed in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv the corresponding promoter activity was reduced to levels comparable with the vector control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the presence of an active promoter within the coding sequence of <italic>recA</italic> was verified.</p>

        <title>The <italic>recX</italic> promoter is not conserved in all mycobacteria</title>
        <p>In order to gain an indication as to how widespread the <italic>recX</italic> promoter internal to <italic>recA</italic> is, we aligned the sequences of the 3′-end of <italic>recA</italic> and the 5′ end of <italic>recX</italic> from a variety of mycobacterial species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Not surprisingly, the sequence was completely conserved in <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. Highly conserved motifs were present in <italic>M. avium</italic> and <italic>M. avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic>, differing from the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> sequence by only a single base in each of the −10 and −35 motifs. In contrast, the −10 region was completely absent in <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>, <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic>. In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> although the corresponding motifs were recognisable, one of the base changes in the −10 region (A to C at −12) would be likely to inactivate the promoter.</p>
        <p>To test if this is the case, we cloned the corresponding region from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> into the <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional reporter vector, creating pJD05. When assayed in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, the expression driven by this sequence (3.0 ± 0.4 units/mg protein) did not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Students <italic>t</italic>-test) from the background level seen with the vector control (2.2 ± 0.4 units/mg protein). Thus, <italic>recX</italic> does not have an additional promoter other than those upstream of <italic>recA</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p>

        <title>What is the significance of the <italic>recX</italic> promoter in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>?</title>
        <p>The presence of an additional promoter for <italic>recX</italic> in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> would be expected to result in a higher <italic>recX</italic> expression level under non-DNA damaging conditions. To assess if this is the case we compared the expression of <italic>recX</italic> with that of <italic>recA</italic> in wild-type H37Rv <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> by qRT-PCR, normalising to <italic>sigA</italic>. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, there was no significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Students <italic>t</italic>-test) in the expression levels of the two genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>M. smegmatis recX</italic> was expressed at a significantly lower level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, Students <italic>t</italic>-test) than <italic>recA</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), although the level of <italic>recA</italic> was similar in the two species. Thus, the ratio of <italic>recX</italic> to <italic>recA</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was a quarter of the corresponding value for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (0.21 compared with 0.84).</p>

        <title>How common are promoters internal to genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>?</title>
        <p>We wondered if promoters were also present within the 3′-ends of other <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> coding sequences. To gain some insight into this question, we took a bioinformatic approach. First we searched the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome sequence for sequences matching the SigA consensus that were located no more than 200 bp upstream of genes, permitting a maximum of 3 mismatches in total, of which no more than 2 could be in a single motif (either the −10 or −35 motif). We identified 231 regions matching these criteria. We then looked to see how many of these were located upstream of the stop codon of the preceding gene. We found that 84 were within 200 bp (<xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary table 1</xref>), and 44 were within 100 bp, of such a stop codon, representing 36% and 20% of predicted promoters respectively. For comparison, we performed the equivalent searches on the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome but using the σ<sup>70</sup> consensus sequence. This revealed the presence of 457 predicted promoters in the 200 bp regions upstream of genes. However, only 49 of these were within 200 bp of the stop codon of the preceding gene (<xref rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary table 2</xref>), and only 22 within 100 bp, representing 11% and 5% of the predicted promoters respectively. Thus, although almost twice as many promoters were predicted within 200 bp upstream of genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> than in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, a much smaller proportion of these were located upstream of the stop codon of the preceding gene, despite the gene density in the two organisms being very similar.<xref rid="bib18 bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,35</sup></xref> This suggests that promoters internal to coding regions may be more common in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> than in some other bacteria.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we have demonstrated that <italic>M. tuberculosis recX</italic> is expressed from a constitutive promoter located within the coding sequence of <italic>recA</italic>, the gene immediately upstream of <italic>recX</italic>, in addition to being co-transcribed with <italic>recA</italic> from its two DNA-damage inducible promoters. The occurrence of promoters internal to coding sequences responsible for transcription of downstream genes in bacteria has only recently been recognised.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Our bioinformatic analysis suggests that promoters so located may be more common in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> than in some other bacteria. The development of genomic RNA sequencing approaches is now facilitating the identification of such promoters, such that over 400 internal transcription start sites have been identified in the pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> It will be interesting to see what this approach reveals in the case of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
      <p>Transcription of <italic>recX</italic> from the promoter internal to <italic>recA</italic> initiated at the A of the <italic>recX</italic> ATG codon. Although relatively uncommon, a few examples of such leaderless mRNAs have been described previously from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>: <italic>purC</italic>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> <italic>oxyR</italic>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> <italic>eis</italic><xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> and <italic>lexA</italic>.<xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,42</sup></xref> Leaderless mRNAs interact preferentially with 70S ribosomes in bacteria<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> and similar findings in eukaryotes have led to the suggestion that this type of mRNA might be evolutionary ancient.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Cross-linking studies have revealed that leaderless mRNAs are recognised by the ribosome initially via the AUG codon; indeed, the addition of an AUG triplet to a random RNA sequence was found to confer ribosome binding.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> The presence of initiator tRNA conferred greater stability on the interaction, as revealed by gel shift and toeprinting assays.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Translation of leaderless mRNAs has also been shown to be preferentially stimulated by initiation factor 2 (IF2),<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> and the ratio of IF2 to IF3 can modify the efficiency of translation initiation on such RNAs,<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> potentially providing a means of modulating translation of leaderless mRNAs in response to conditions causing a variation in the availability of these components of the translational machinery.</p>
      <p>The expression of the reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic> driven by the <italic>recX</italic> promoter (ca. 200 units) was at a comparable level to that conferred by either of the <italic>recA</italic> promoters under non-DNA damaging conditions (P1 ca. 100 units and P2 ca. 230 units<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref>) when present on fragments of similar size. Thus, it can be expected to make a significant contribution to the expression of <italic>recX</italic> in the absence of DNA damage. Intriguingly, this <italic>recX</italic> promoter is missing in some other mycobacterial species (<italic>M. marinum</italic>, <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic>) and is not active in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> owing to base changes within the promoter elements. At present it is not clear whether <italic>M. avium</italic> and <italic>M. avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> possess an active promoter in this region. As would be expected from the observations described above, the expression of <italic>recX</italic> relative to that of <italic>recA</italic> was lower in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> than in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
      <p>RecX protein interacts with RecA to modulate its activities.<xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9–11</sup></xref> Thus, the elevated ratio of RecX to RecA in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> may influence RecA function. RecX inhibits the ATPase and strand-exchange activities of RecA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and so may affect DNA repair processes in the cell. Indeed, the lack of <italic>recX</italic> has been reported to have a small effect on survival following UV irradiation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> RecX also inhibits the ability of RecA to stimulate cleavage of the repressor protein LexA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and, when overexpressed, in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> This latter property results in a reduced rate of induction of LexA-regulated genes in response to DNA damage under the tested conditions. Thus, it is possible that higher basal expression of RecX relative to RecA in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> may contribute to the previously observed slower kinetics of induction of the SOS response in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> However, it should be remembered that once induction has occurred, the expression of <italic>recX</italic> will be dominated by the elevated activity of the two <italic>recA</italic> promoters which are both induced by DNA damage.<xref rid="bib22 bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,48</sup></xref> To definitively assess the biological significance of the <italic>recX</italic> promoter located within the <italic>recA</italic> coding sequence it would be necessary to introduce point mutations that inactivate this promoter and compare the resulting phenotype with a strain having the wild-type sequence. However, this is problematical as the point mutation most likely to inactivate the promoter (A to C at −12) would also result in an amino acid change in RecA (aspartic acid to alanine in the above example) that could affect its activity. The only silent point mutation in terms of coding sequence (T to C at −11) seems less likely to inactivate the promoter, although this could be tested by introducing the base change into a transcriptional fusion plasmid such as pPRrecX.</p>
