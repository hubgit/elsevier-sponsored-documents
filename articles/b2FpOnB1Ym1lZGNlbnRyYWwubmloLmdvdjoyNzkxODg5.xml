        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are reported in chronic infections. However, the signals that direct the development of IL-10-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells are undefined. We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation. Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL-10 production by Th1 cells, and continued IL-12 action and high-dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets. IL-10 expression also correlated with <italic>c-maf</italic> expression. Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL-10 production.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine with broad anti-inflammatory properties that inhibits macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) function (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2001</xref>). IL-10 limits the immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens and gut flora and prevents damage to the host (<xref rid="bib35 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2001; O'Garra and Vieira, 2004</xref>), but when dysregulated may result in chronic infection (<xref rid="bib9 bib15 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2001</xref>). IL-10 is expressed by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2001</xref>), and also by Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib14 bib18 bib27 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2007; Assenmacher et al., 1994; Del Prete et al., 1993; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jankovic et al., 2007; Pohl-Koppe et al., 1998</xref>) and (reviewed in <xref rid="bib39 bib50" ref-type="bibr">O'Garra and Vieira, 2007; Trinchieri, 2007</xref>), certain regulatory (Treg) T cells (<xref rid="bib35 bib38 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2001; O'Garra and Vieira, 2004; Roncarolo et al., 2006</xref>), and Th17 cells (<xref rid="bib4 bib16 bib32 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Awasthi et al., 2007; Fitzgerald et al., 2007; McGeachy et al., 2007; Stumhofer et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>In vitro human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones, or mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that produce both interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-10, can be differentiated by T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation in the presence of IL-12 (<xref rid="bib12 bib18 bib29 bib33 bib54" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jeannin et al., 1996; Meyaard et al., 1996; Windhagen et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, Th1 cell clones coproducing IFN-γ and IL-10 have been isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gerosa et al., 1999</xref>). IL-10 production by Th1 cells was also reported in animals infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref rid="bib28 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2006</xref>) or with <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>) and shown to be required for regulation of the immune response in these infections (<xref rid="bib2 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007</xref>). The relative amounts of IL-10 and IFN-γ produced by Th1 cells may influence the balance between clearance and persistent infection with certain pathogens (<xref rid="bib35 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2001; Trinchieri, 2007</xref>), thus determining whether chronic infection or immunopathology ensues.</p>
      <p>Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell responses differentiate along distinct signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib19 bib26 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Ivanov et al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007</xref>). Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-γ, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-κB transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-γ required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000</xref>). Th2 cell development, with expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, requires IL-4, STAT6, and the transcription factor GATA binding protein (GATA)-3 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000</xref>). The development of Th17 cells requires IL-6, TGF-β, and the STAT3-dependent expression of the transcription factor RORγt (<xref rid="bib26 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Th1 and Th2 cell responses can also be induced by varying the dose of antigen presented to the naive T cell by the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN-γ via an IL-12-independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL-4 secretion (<xref rid="bib13 bib23 bib30 bib56" ref-type="bibr">Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because Th1 and Th2 cells cross regulate each other's development and function and can suppress Th17 cell responses, and all differentiate along distinct signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib19 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007</xref>), IL-10 produced by all these Th cells may thus act as a feedback regulator to control the pathology associated with an overexuberant, albeit efficacious, inflammatory response. Whether IL-10 production by these different Th cell subsets is induced by independent and/or common mechanisms is unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, we showed that in vitro differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells required IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation (high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets. This common but highly regulated pathway for IL-10 induction and maintenance ensures its function as a feedback loop to control damage to the host and also allows a protective response to ensue as opposed to chronic infection.</p>

        <title>IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10</title>
        <p>To study the differentiation of Th1 cells coproducing IFN-γ and IL-10, we cultured purified TCR-transgenic DO11.10 naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with purified DCs as APCs and increasing doses of ovalbumin peptide 323-339 (OVA). Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN-γ upon restimulation (<xref rid="bib13 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995</xref>), but not IL-10 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A available online). Culture with low antigen doses under the same conditions led to the differentiation of Th2 cells, which expressed both IL-4 and IL-10 upon restimulation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A). Culture of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12. At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-γ expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen. Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-γ and lost their capacity to produce IL-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at both high and low antigen doses (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells is most likely not related to limited IL-2. Naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T cells or Treg cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>). Although it has been suggested that TGF-β can induce IL-10 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib31 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kitani et al., 2003; Schiott et al., 2000</xref>), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown). In fact, neutralization of TGF-β led to increased IL-10 production by both T cell subsets (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-β or on the presence of other T cell types.</p>

        <title>IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-γ, or IL-4 Signaling</title>
        <p>To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>). Naive CD4<sup>+</sup> D011.10 T cells deficient in STAT4 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 1998</xref>) were cultured in the presence of IL-12 and OVA. Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-γ was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.</p>
        <p>Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (<xref rid="bib19 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et al., 2000</xref>). The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-γ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response. As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by T cells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient T cells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-γ, as suggested before (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2006</xref>), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-γ-deficient naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA. The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-γ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), showing that the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-γ. In the absence of IFN-γ, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).</p>
        <p>We also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen. As observed in the absence of STAT6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.</p>

        <title>High Antigen Doses and STAT4 Are Required for the In Vivo Generation of IL-10-Producing Th1 Cells</title>
        <p>To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS). T cells were recovered from the inguinal lymph nodes 3 days after priming and restimulated in vitro with OVA peptide for 48 hr. This in vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-γ production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 μM versus 1 μM, data not shown). To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before. In vivo expression of both IL-10 and IFN-γ was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in vitro system. Signaling through STAT6 had no effect on IL-10 production by Th1 cells as shown by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and by immunoassay in STAT6-deficient T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.4">
        <title>IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12</title>
        <p>We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells. For this, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL-12 throughout (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4D). High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D). However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.</p>
        <p>To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10. Finally, DO11.10 CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-γ but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.</p>

        <title>IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation</title>
        <p>Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12. Signaling through the TCR with high doses of antigen induced stronger ERK1 and ERK2 activation than that induced by low antigen dose, not only in naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown) as previously demonstrated (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Jorritsma et al., 2003</xref>) but also in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells restimulated with the same high and low antigen doses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation. To ensure that only T cell signaling was being affected by U0126, we used an APC-free system in which the T cells were differentiated in the presence of increasing doses of anti-CD3 and a constant amount of IL-12. As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-γ after 1 week of culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). Addition of U0126 to the cultures abrogated the production of IL-10 at all doses of anti-CD3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref rid="bib5 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001</xref>), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (<xref rid="bib5 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001</xref>). PD184352 caused a similar inhibition of IL-10 production by Th1 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A). Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3β inhibitor, CT99021 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bain et al., 2007</xref>), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>B). Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3β pathways.</p>

        <p>To investigate further the downstream factors involved in regulating IL-10 production, we differentiated DO11.10 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with increasing doses of OVA, in the presence or absence of IL-12, and quantified the expression of cytokines and transcription factors by real-time RT-PCR. Low-dose antigen resulted in transcription of <italic>Il4</italic> and this was abrogated by both high antigen doses and IL-12 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). A low amount of transcription of <italic>Ifn</italic>γ was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). A low amount of <italic>Il10</italic> transcription was observed at low doses of antigen accompanying <italic>Il4</italic> expression (Th2 cell response), and this was abrogated by increased doses of antigen as was <italic>Il4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A).

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of <italic>Il10</italic> transcription as well as <italic>Ifnγ</italic> expression with increased antigen doses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), again in keeping with the protein data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p>
        <p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated with increasing doses of antigen did not express high amounts of Tbx-21 (T-bet) mRNA, unless they were cocultured with IL-12 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Differentiation of T cells under low antigen dose led to expression of <italic>c-maf</italic>, in keeping with the Th2 cell profile (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 1996</xref>), which was almost completely abrogated by increasing doses of antigen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).

        <p>In Th17 cells that expressed IL-17a as well as IL-10 mRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA were undetectable (data not shown), whereas that of ROR-γt was high (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>IL-10 expression by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems reflects the importance of this cytokine in the tight regulation of the immune response, to minimize pathology during infection. IL-10 expression by Th1 cells has been reported to regulate the immune response in leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis. However, in many situations, IL-10 is not produced by Th1 cells in response to antigenic stimulation. Our goal was to address the molecular signals that determine whether Th1 cells develop to produce IL-10 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Trinchieri, 2007</xref>). Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high-antigen-dose-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL-12-induced STAT-4 activation to produce IL-10. Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL-10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.</p>
      <p>In certain viral or parasitic infections (<xref rid="bib2 bib9 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2007; Brooks et al., 2006; Ejrnaes et al., 2006</xref>), high amounts of stimulation may lead to the chronic nonhealing infection shown to be regulated by IL-10. During the course of infection, after initial triggering with antigen, T cells migrate to the tissue encountering high doses of antigen and factors produced by the innate immune response. Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL-10, in keeping with reports that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were found in CD4<sup>+</sup> clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gerosa et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of <italic>L. major</italic>, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL-10 derived from Foxp3<sup>−</sup> Th1 cells that coproduce IL-10 and IFN-γ (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>), and the immune response during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3<sup>−</sup> Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et al., 2007</xref>). It is likely that IL-10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with <italic>L. major</italic> (Friedlin strain) (<xref rid="bib8 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006</xref>). We now also reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL-12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN-γ and IL-10, lose their IL-2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sallusto et al., 2004</xref>). Our demonstration that loss of IL-2 is accompanied by production of IL-10 offers potential additional mechanisms whereby effector T cell responses may be dampened during chronic disease.</p>
      <p>Using an in vivo transfer model of DO11.10 TCR transgenic cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2000</xref>), we showed that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated in the presence of high doses of OVA protein and LPS. We showed here that this induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4-deficient T cells as observed during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et al., 2002</xref>). A high antigenic activation during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL-12 in the induction of IL-10 by Th1 cells.</p>
      <p>In our in vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 in an IL-12-dependent manner. IL-10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL-12 was independent of IFN-γ, in keeping with previous findings (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et al., 2002</xref>). However, a role for IFN-γ in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> has been suggested (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2006</xref>). We have found that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL-10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL-10 upon re-exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL-12. However, this is dependent on the induction of IL-12 by antigen-presenting DCs. The combination of both high antigen dose and IL-12 resulted in the highest levels of IL-10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation. The increased expression of IFN-γ observed during the secondary phase will induce increased IL-12 production by DCs and suggests that repeated high-level TCR activation feeds back to upregulate IL-12 production by DC. It is thus likely that in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in vivo (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2006</xref>), the requirement for IFN-γ to induce IL-10, was for feedback upregulation of IL-12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL-10 in the Th1 cells.</p>
      <p>Although IL-10 may be differentially regulated in Th1 and Th2 cells as has been reported (<xref rid="bib12 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005</xref>), some studies suggest the existence of common pathways, but the molecular basis for these is as yet unclear. Costimulatory OX-40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL-10 production (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2005</xref>) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL-10 (<xref rid="bib25 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2007; Witsch et al., 2002</xref>) in both Th1 and Th2 cells. However, in some cases, ICOS signaling also regulates IL-4 production and Th2 responses (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald et al., 2005</xref>). We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL-10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset-specific transcriptional pathway. This reinforces the fact that IL-10 is not a Th cell-subset-specific cytokine, but instead is produced in a tightly regulated fashion during each differentiation pathway. Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL-10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC (<xref rid="bib1 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Differential transcriptional regulation of IL-10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested (<xref rid="bib12 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL-10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). We provide evidence that IL-10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of <italic>T-bet</italic> and the highest IFN-γ production, in keeping with our observations that high-dose antigen stimulation and IL-12 signaling are required for IL-10 and IFN-γ expression. It has also been shown that maintenance of IL-10 expression is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4 unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007</xref>), which can remodel the IL-10 locus, thus explaining the highest amounts of IL-10 produced by Th2 cells (<xref rid="bib12 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007; Shoemaker et al., 2006</xref>). We show here that high antigen dose and IL-12 drastically downregulate <italic>Gata-3</italic> expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL-10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently. Expression of <italic>c-maf</italic> was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL-12 and present in Th17 cells. That <italic>c-maf</italic> expression is common to IL-10-producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL-10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 expression in macrophages (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, we show that although Th1, Th2, and Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets differentiate along distinct signaling and transcriptional pathways, they can all be induced to make IL-10. ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL-10 production by all these Th cell subsets. With regard to the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL-10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL-12 encountered in the environment. This provides a mechanism whereby a Th1 cell responds to extrinsic signals, reflecting increased inflammation in the tissue, to tightly regulate the production of IL-10 so as to allow a protective response to eradicate a pathogen with minimal damage to the host and also prevent chronic infection. Moreover, our findings have important implications for the regulation of IL-10 production during an inflammatory Th1 response in infection and may be of relevance for the design of vaccines and for strategies in immunotherapy in infectious diseases.</p>

        <p>IL-12 Enhances IL-10 Production at High Antigen Dose Only</p>
        <p>Naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10 TCR transgenic animals were isolated and differentiated for 1 week with splenic DCs in medium containing increasing doses of OVA in the absence (medium) or presence of IL-12, as indicated. On day 7, cells were restimulated for 4 hr with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 and BrefeldinA and (A) stained at the single-cell level for IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-4, or (B) stimulated similarly for 48 hr in the absence of BrefeldinA, and the culture supernatants analyzed by ELISA. Data are representative of six experiments performed; error bars in (B) refer to the standard deviation of three independent cultures.</p>

        <p>In Vivo Generation of IL-10-Producing Th1 Cells Requires High Antigen Dose, Innate Immune Signals and STAT4</p>
        <p>(A) Spleen cell suspensions from DO11.10 animals were injected into BALB/c recipients. Cells were isolated from the inguinal lymph nodes of mice injected with PBS, OVA protein (5 mg) plus or minus LPS (5 μg) and restimulated in vitro with OVA for 48 hr. IL-10 and IFN-γ production was analyzed by ELISA. Represented is the mean ± SD of groups of three animals each. Spleen cell suspensions from DO11.10 WT (ten animals), <italic>Stat4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (nine animals), or <italic>Stat6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (ten animals) were transferred into BALB/c recipients, which were then injected with OVA protein and LPS (5 mg and 5 μg, respectively). Cells recovered as above were restimulated in vitro, for 24–48 hr with the last 6 hr in the presence (for ICS, B) or absence (for ELISA, C) of BrefeldinA. IL-10 and IFN-γ expression was detected by ICS and represented within the CD4<sup>+</sup> KJ1-26<sup>+</sup> T cells population.</p>
        <p>(B) We obtained the plots represented by merging the plots from each mouse within one group. Two independent experiments confirmed the result showed and the mean percentage of IL-10/IFN-γ producers ± SD was 3.95 ± 1.15 and 2.25 ± 0.68; 4.29 ± 1.36 and 7.11 ± 1.86; and 3.82 ± 0.96 and 10.19 ± 2.25 for DO11.10 WT, <italic>Stat4</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, and <italic>Stat6</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, respectively.</p>

        <p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10 TCR transgenic animals were cultured with a high (0.7 μM) or low (0.01 μM) dose of OVA and DC in the absence or presence of IL-12. On day 3, cells were harvested, rested for 5 hr in low (1%) serum medium, and restimulated with high (0.7 μM) or low (0.01 μM) antigen dose, in the (A and B) absence or in the (B) presence of IL-12, for the indicated time points. Cellular lysates were prepared, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phospho(p)- or total(t)-ERK1 and ERK2 were detected by immunoblotting. Actin was included as a loading control (A and B). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from BALB/c animals were isolated and cultured for 7 days in the presence of increasing doses of plate-bound anti-CD3, soluble anti-CD28, and IL-12 (3 ng/ml), in the absence (control, with DMSO) or presence of U0126 (2.5 μM) (MEK Inhibitor). As shown in (C), on day 7, cells were restimulated as above and the expression of IL-10 and IFN-γ was detected by ICS. Cytokine production in the supernatants of 48 hr restimulated cultures was analyzed by ELISA and confirmed the ICS results (data not shown). As shown in (D), CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from BALB/c animals were isolated and cultured for 5 days in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3, soluble anti-CD28 and one of the following combinations: IL-12 (3 ng/ml) plus anti-IL-4 (20 μg/ml), for Th1; IL-4 (10 ng/ml) plus anti-IL-12 (10 μg/ml), for Th2; or IL-6 (50 ng/ml), TGF-β (1 ng/ml) and IL-1 (10 ng/ml), for Th17, all in the absence (control, with DMSO) or presence of PD184352 MEK Inhibitor, as in (C). On day 5, cells were restimulated with PdBU and ionomycin, and the expression of IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 was detected by ICS.
