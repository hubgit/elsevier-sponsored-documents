        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Pro-inflammatory mediators, like prostaglandin (PG) and chemokines, promote tumourigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation, migration of immune cells and recruitment of blood vessels. Recently we showed elevated expression of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) in endometrial adenocarcinomas localized to neutrophils and neoplastic epithelial and vascular cells. Furthermore we found that PGF<sub>2α</sub>-F-prostanoid (FP) receptor regulates the expression of the CXCR2 ligand CXCL1, to promote neutrophil chemotaxis in endometrial adenocarcinomas. In the present study we identified another CXCR2 ligand, CXCL8 as a target for PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling which enhances epithelial cell proliferation in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in nude mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor interaction induces CXCL8 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells via the protein kinase C–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway. Promoter analysis revealed that CXCL8 transcriptional activation by PGF<sub>2α</sub> signaling is mediated by cooperative interactions between the AP1 and NFAT binding sites. Furthermore, PGF<sub>2α</sub> via the FP receptor induced the expression of the regulator of calcineurin 1 isoform 4 (RCAN1-4) via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in a reciprocal manner to CXCL8. Using an adenovirus to overexpress RCAN1-4, we found that RCAN1-4 is a negative regulator of CXCL8 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. Taken together our data have elucidated the molecular and cellular mechanism whereby PGF<sub>2α</sub> regulates CXCL8 expression via the FP receptor in endometrial adenocarcinomas and have highlighted RCAN1-4 as a negative regulator of CXCL8 expression which may be exploited therapeutically to inhibit CXCL8-mediated tumour development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human endometrium undergoes a state of inflammation and repair in a cyclical nature every 28 days <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This is characterized by the induction of inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), release of prostaglandins (PG) and cytokines <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Chronic inflammation has been linked to increased cancer risk, for example hepatitis and colitis have been shown to promote liver <xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref> and colon cancer <xref rid="bib2 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[2,4]</xref> respectively. By contrast, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and suppression of the COX-prostaglandin axis is associated with an inverse risk of developing cancer. In the Western world, endometrial cancer is one of the leading gynecological malignancies <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[5–7]</xref>. We and others have demonstrated elevated expression of the inflammatory enzyme COX-2, prostaglandin receptors and elevated signaling of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub> and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor in endometrial adenocarcinomas <xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[8–13]</xref>. These findings suggest that endometrial cancers are controlled in an autocrine/paracrine manner by the COX-PG axis via the synthesis and release of potent growth factors.</p>
      <p>Dysregulated chemoattractive cytokine (chemokine) expression is known to contribute to pathologies by promoting uncontrolled proliferation, invasion and migration of cells <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) and its G protein-coupled receptor CXCR2 has been demonstrated in regulating growth and development of colon carcinomas via the COX-PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling axis <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore we have recently shown that CXCL1 expression is elevated in endometrial adenocarcinomas and promotes neutrophil chemotaxis via PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Another chemokine ligand of the CXCR2 receptor, CXCL8, has also been implicated in tumourigenesis by enhancing melanoma cell proliferation <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, alveolar epithelial neoplasia <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and breast cancer development <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, however its expression and role in endometrial adenocarcinoma is unclear.</p>
      <p>Here we identified CXCL8 as a target for PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signaling in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model system, endometrial adenocarcinoma explants and a nude mouse xenograft model, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms mediating PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signaling to CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells its potential role in endometrial tumourigenesis.</p>

        <p>Wild type Ishikawa cells and Ishikawa cells engineered to stably express the full length human FP (PTGFR, accession no: <ext-link xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_000959" ext-link-type="uri">NM_000959</ext-link>) receptor to the levels observed in endometrial adenocarcinomas, referred to as Ishikawa FPS cells, were cultured as described previously <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ishikawa FPS cells were manufactured commercially, clonally selected and verified as described in our previous study <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using this <italic>in vitro</italic> model system, we have previously demonstrated that the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling in Ishikawa FPS cells parallels the <italic>ex vivo</italic> effects of PGF<sub>2α</sub> on endometrial adenocarcinoma explants <xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>. Transient transfections were performed using Superfect (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The concentrations of all chemical inhibitors and antibodies were determined empirically by titration using the manufacturer's guidelines as described in our previous studies <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A list of all chemical inhibitors and their targets is outlined in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Cell viability was determined for each inhibitor using the CellTitre 96 AQueous One Solution assay (Promega, Southampton, UK) as described <xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref>. Cells were treated with 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> alone or in the presence of AL8810, YM254890, U73122 , 43CMQ, RO-318220, Cyclosporine A, Inca-6, EGTA, SN-50 for the time indicated. In parallel cells treated with vehicle (either distilled water, ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide v/v) and chemical inhibitor served as a control for each treatment. Fold increase was calculated by dividing the values obtained from the PGF<sub>2α</sub>/PGF<sub>2α</sub> -inhibitor treatments by the vehicle/vehicle-inhibitor treatments.

        <title>BrdU/cytokeratin staining and quantification</title>
        <p>The expression of BrdU and cytokeratin in Ishikawa FPS IgG control and FPS CXCL8-neutralised tumours was determined by standard immunohistochemistry techniques as described above and quantified using standard stereology techniques. Briefly images were captured using a × 40 plan apo objective from a BH2 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with an automatic stage (Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using a video camera (HV-C20; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and were analyzed with Image-Pro Plus 4.5.1 software with a Stereology 5.0 plug-in (Media Cybernetics, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK). A total of 100 randomised fields of view were examined and counted from 8 tumours in each group. The total number of BrdU/cytokeratin positive epithelial cells per field of view were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total points per field of view and presented as mean ± SEM.</p>

        <title>PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation induces CXCL8 expression and release in Ishikawa FPS cells</title>
        <p>Using a chemokine protein array, we identified the inflammatory chemokine CXCL8 as a target for PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signaling in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). We subsequently investigated the regulation of CXCL8 via the F-prostanoid receptor in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells and the potential role of CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinomas. PGF<sub>2α</sub> stimulation of Ishikawa FPS cells <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> resulted in a significant time-dependent increase in the expression of CXCL8 promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Co-treatment of Ishikawa FPS cells with 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> and AL8810, YM254890, U73122, RO-318220, EGTA, Inca-6 or CsA, but not 4C3MQ significantly inhibited the expression of CXCL8 mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and release of CXCL8 protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

        <title>PGF<sub>2α</sub> induces activation of CXCL8 promoter through AP1 and NFAT</title>
        <p>To determine the regions of the CXCL8 promoter involved in regulating gene transcription in response to PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor interaction, Ishikawa FPS cells were transiently transfected with plasmid cDNA containing the full length (− 1400/+ 44) or serial deletions of the CXCL8 promoter (− 162/+ 44, − 132/+ 44, − 99/+ 44 and − 54/+ 44) linked to the luciferase reporter gene <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. We found a considerable reduction in promoter activity when the CXCL8 promoter was truncated down to − 99 nucleotides of the 5′ flanking region of the CXCL8 gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). No further reduction in promoter activity was observed in the − 54 nucleotides truncated construct which only contains the CXCL8 TATA box (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The use of site directed mutated versions of the − 162 CXCL8 promoter-luciferase construct at consensus binding sequences for activator protein 1 (AP1) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) showed that these binding sites are required for the induction of transcription of CXCL8 by PGF<sub>2α</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, we confirmed that CXCL8 transcriptional activation in response to PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling occurred via the PKC–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and this was independent of nuclear factor (NF)κB (as NFAT and NFκB have similar consensus motifs on the DNA binding domain) since the NFκB inhibitory peptide SN-50 (100 μg/ml) did not reduce the activity of CXCL8 promoter induced by PGF<sub>2α</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). In agreement with this, Ishikawa FPS cells transfected with the pNFκB-Luc vector and treated with 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> did not induce NFκB-driven luciferase activity, whereas transfection of Ishikawa FPS cells with the pNFAT-Luc or pAP1-Luc vector which contains the a cis-acting NFAT or AP1 enhancer element showed a time dependent increase in luciferase activity in response to treatment with 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). We confirmed that the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-mediated activation of the − 162/+ 44 CXCL8 reporter gene construct occurred via the NFAT and AP1, but not NFκB, elements using specific inhibitors of NFAT (Inca-6) and AP1 (transretinoic acid; RA) and NFκB (SN-50) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

Since these transcriptional regulatory proteins are both regulated by PGF<sub>2α</sub> via the PKC–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT pathways and are essential for CXCL8 activity, we performed further studies to determine whether the CXCL8 promoter was co-operatively regulated by the NFAT-AP1 complex as has been described for other cytokines such as IL-2 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We found that transretinoic acid (which causes dissociation of the AP1 complex) or co-transfection of Ishikawa FPS cells with the dn c-Jun (also called TAM67) that lacks the transactivating domain <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> abolished both the transcriptional activity of AP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and NFAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) promoter elements. Furthermore, disruption of the AP1 protein complex with the dn c-Jun construct abolished the transcriptional activity of the truncated − 162/+ 44 as well as the full length − 1400/+ 44 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) CXCL8 promoter activity in response to PGF<sub>2α</sub> treatment indicating that an AP1-NFAT protein complex is essential for CXCL8 activation.</p>

        <title>PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation induces the expression of the calcineurin negative modulator RCAN1</title>
        <p>Having identified that the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation of CXCL8 was mediated via the calcineurin–NFAT signalling pathway, we explored whether CXCL8 was regulated by the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), previously known as Down syndrome critical region gene 1 (DSCR1) or Adapt 78 which is known to endogenously modulate calcineurin–NFAT signaling <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We identified that PGF<sub>2α</sub> induces the expression of isoform 4 of RCAN1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A) in rapid time-dependent manner, with maximal levels of expression after 4 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Co-treatment of Ishikawa FPS cells with AL8810, YM254890. U73122, RO-318220, EGTA, Inca-6 or CsA, but not 4C3MQ significantly inhibited the expression of RCAN1-4 mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These data indicate that PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling regulates RCAN1-4 expression in a reciprocal time dependent manner to CXCL8 via the same calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signal transduction pathway regulating CXCL8.</p>

        <title>RCAN1-4 overexpression inhibits PGF<sub>2α</sub>-induced expression of CXCL8</title>
        <p>RCAN1-4 is known to bind to calcineurin and inhibit activation of NFAT when overexpressed <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Overexpression of RCAN1-4 in Ishikawa FPS cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D, E and F; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) using RCAN1-4 adenovirus significantly reduced the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor induction of CXCL8 promoter and mRNA expression and protein secretion compared to cells infected with the scrambled control virus. Conversely, infection of cells with RCAN1-4 lentivirus short hairpin (Sh) RNA which ablates RCAN1-4 protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), augmented the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation of CXCL8 mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) confirming that RCAN1-4 is a negative regulator of CXCL8.</p>
        <p>We further investigated the effect of disruption of NFAT activity by RCAN1-4 overexpression on activation of the NFAT and AP1 DNA transactivation domains. We found that as observed for the disruption of the AP1 transcription complex with the transretinoic acid or dn c-Jun (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C), inhibiting NFAT activity with the RCAN1-4 adenovirus also inhibited the AP1 and NFAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) promoter activity, giving further support for co-operativity between AP1 and NFAT.</p>

        <title>CXCL8 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma and normal endometrium</title>
        <p>We next explored the expression of CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinoma and normal endometrial tissues and its potential regulation by PGF<sub>2α</sub> via the FP receptor. CXCL8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A) mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma irrespective of grade or stage of cancer compared with normal endometrium (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). CXCL8 immunoreactivity in endometrial adenocarcinomas was observed in the glandular epithelium (G; as indicated by the brown staining) with some diffuse stromal (S), staining irrespective of grade/stage of endometrial adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B).</p>
        <p>PGF<sub>2α</sub> stimulation of endometrial adenocarcinoma explants resulted in a significant increase in the expression of CXCL8 mRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C) and secretion of CXCL8 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D), which was inhibited by co-treatment of tissue explants with the specific FP receptor antagonist AL8810 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).

        <title>CXCL8 enhances Ishikawa FPS cell proliferation in nude mice <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To explore whether CXCL8 induced by FP receptor signalling could alter tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> we injected wild type Ishikawa (WT) cells or FPS cells subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of nude mice. Mice were then regularly injected with control IgG (WT and FPS xenografts) or CXCL8 antibody (FPS xenografts). Tumours formed from FPS cells expressed significantly higher CXCL8 mRNA as compared to WT tumours indicating that there was sufficient endogenous PGF<sub>2α</sub> in nude mice to induce CXCL8 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> via the FP receptor similar to our observations in these cell lines vitro (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining showed a significant reduction in the BrdU incorporation in the epithelial compartment of the mouse tumours in the animals engrafted with FPS tumour and treated with a CXCL8 neutralising antibody compared with FPS IgG controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, we found that the administration of the CXCL8 neutralising antibody to FPS xenografts had reduced the amount of cytokeratin 18 positive immunoreactivity (as indicated by the brown staining) thereby confirming a reduction in the epithelial cell component of the xenograft tumours (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B and C, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, we observed no significant reduction in tumour size or volume between the various treatment groups during the 4 weeks of neutralising antibody administration, but rather a gross infiltration of other cell types (stromal, vascular, immune cells as indicated by the blue haematoxylin counterstain) to maintain tumour volume as shown in the representative image in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Inflammation and infection are estimated to contribute to 25% of all cancer cases world wide <xref rid="bib2 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[2, 35]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling can promote the expression of a potent chemokine with known tumourigenic and angiogenic properties <xref rid="bib17 bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[17–19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Chemokines have emerged as important regulators of tumour function in colorectal carcinomas <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, melanomas, pancreatic, head and neck and lung carcinomas <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and are known to promote angiogenesis and proliferation of endometrial stromal cells <xref rid="bib14 bib36 bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[14,36–38]</xref>. Moreover we have recently shown that chemokines regulated by the FP receptor can also induce neutrophil chemotaxis in endometrial adenocarcinomas <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study we have demonstrated that PGF<sub>2α</sub> promotes the synthesis and release of CXCL8 in a time-dependent manner via the protein kinase C–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signalling pathway. Using luciferase reporter gene analysis and site directed mutations of the AP1 or NFAT <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> binding site on the CXCL8 promoter we determined that both AP1 and NFAT were essential for gene activation by PGF<sub>2α</sub> and that this was independent of NFκB. Moreover we determined that both AP1- and NFAT cis-acting enhancer elements were regulated by the same protein kinase C–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT pathway which regulates CXCL8 activation. NFAT and AP1 are known to co-operate and mutually stabilise each others interaction with the DNA binding domain to allow full gene transactivation to occur, and this interaction is critical for transcription of cytokines such as interleukin-2 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, NFAT has been shown to complex with the two AP1 subunits, cJun and cFos via direct protein-protein interactions to co-ordinate promoter activity <xref rid="bib28 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[28–30]</xref>. We found that disruption of the AP1 complex with dn c-Jun or transretinoic acid, abolished not only the ability of PGF<sub>2α</sub> to mediate transactivation of the AP1 cis-acting enhancer element, but also abolished the PGF<sub>2α</sub> -mediated transactivation of the NFAT luciferase reporter gene as well as the − 162 and full length − 1400 CXCL8 luciferase reporter gene. These data give further support to the co-ordinated regulation of CXCL8 transcription by a protein complex comprising of the AP1 proteins and NFAT.</p>
      <p>NFAT activation by calcineurin, which mediates its dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus is known to be regulated by the regulator of calcinerin (RCAN) <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. RCAN1-4 is known to bind to calcineurin and previous studies have shown that overexpression of this protein results in an inhibition of calcineurin activation of NFAT <xref rid="bib27 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[27, 33]</xref>. We showed that RCAN1-4 was regulated by PGF<sub>2α</sub> in a reciprocal time-dependent manner to that of CXCL8, with a peak that preceded CXCL8 by 8 h, via the calcium–calcineurin–NFAT pathway. This is in agreement with other published observations that show that expression of this isoform is induced by NFAT <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and can negatively regulate prokineticin-prokineticin receptor 1 signaling to CXCL8 in endometrial epithelial cells <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Moreover adenovirus and lentivirus infection studies showed that RCAN1-4 is a negative regulator of PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor mediated induction of CXCL8 by inhibiting the PGF<sub>2α</sub>- mediated activation of the AP1 and NFAT cis-acting enhancer elements, similar to our observations for the dn c-Jun and transretinoic acid, giving further support for the co-operativity of NFAT and AP1 in mediating the full transcriptional activation of CXCL8.</p>
      <p>We investigated the effect of CXCL8 on cellular proliferation since humanised CXCL8 antibody has recently been shown to inhibit tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We found that CXCL8 could enhance epithelial cell proliferation via interaction with the CXCR2 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>To determine whether PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signaling regulates CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinomas, we determined the expression pattern and localization of CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue. We found that CXCL8 mRNA expression was elevated in endometrial adenocarcinomas irrespective of grade or stage and localized to the neoplastic glandular epithelial compartment with some diffuse stromal staining—similar to expression reported for this chemokine in normal endometrial glandular epithelium <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore we have shown that CXCL8 immunolocalised to the same cellular compartment in endometrial adenocarcinomas as the FP receptor and CXCR2 (the receptor for CXCL8) <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and that CXCL8 expression and release is regulated in endometrial carcinoma explants <italic>ex vivo</italic> by PGF<sub>2α</sub> via the FP receptor. Moreover we have shown that CXCL8 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma explants is negatively regulated by RCAN1-4 since infection of endometrial adenocarcinoma explants with RCAN1-4 adenovirus abolished the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor-mediated induction of CXCL8. These data suggest that the molecular mechanism that we have elucidated for the regulation of CXCL8 via the RCAN1-4 pathway <italic>in vitro</italic> can potentially regulate CXCL8 in endometrial adenocarcinomas. Although little is known of the role of CXCL8 in endometrial cancer, dysregulated CXCL8 and CXCR2 expression has recently been proposed to play a role in other endometrial disorders such as endometriosis <xref rid="bib14 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[14, 38]</xref>. Furthermore, CXCL8 has recently been shown to enhance the proliferation and migration of squamous carcinoma cells <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and its elevated secretion in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas has been related to lymph node and distant metastases <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally we investigated the impact of CXCL8 expression on tumour development <italic>in vivo</italic> by engrafting nude mice with wild type Ishikawa cells and FPS Ishikawa cells. We found that CXCL8 expression was significantly elevated in FPS xenograft tumours compared with wild type tumours indicating that FP receptor was being activated by endogenous PGF<sub>2α</sub> <italic>in vivo</italic> similar to our observations using FPS cells and administering exogenous PGF<sub>2α</sub> <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further confirmed that CXCL8 played a role in epithelial cell function <italic>in vivo</italic>, as Ishikawa FPS cell tumour xenografts in nude mice treated with a CXCL8 neutralising antibody displayed reduced neoplastic epithelial cell proliferation characterised by reduced BrdU incorporation and reduced cytokeratin 18 immunoreactivity, compared to IgG treated controls. Further studies are currently underway in our laboratory to determine whether alterations in cell type and density within a tumour effects tumour outcome.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our data (as summarised in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) show that PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells promotes the activation of RCAN1-4 and CXCL8 via the Gq-PLC-PKC–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT. The activation of RCAN1-4 is reciprocal to CXCL8, such that at the peak of RCAN1-4 expression, CXCL8 expression is minimal and vice versa. As RCAN1-4 expression reduces over time, the expression of CXCL8 increases to promote tumour cell proliferation. Furthermore, we confirmed that RCAN1-4 is a potent negative regulator of CXCL8 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> in endometrial adenocarcinomas explants and that the regulation of transcriptional activation of CXCL8 by PGF<sub>2α</sub> occurs via the co-operativity between AP1 and NFAT DNA binding elements. To our knowledge this represents the first report mapping the molecular and cellular regulation of CXCL8 by prostanoids and its potential involvement in endometrial cancers.</p>

        <p>CXCL8 is induced by PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor signalling. (A) Chemokine release in response to 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> treatment in Ishikawa FPS cells. Conditioned medium obtained from Ishikawa FPS cells treated with vehicle or 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> for 24 h was tested for the expression of chemokines using the human cytokine antibody array (RayBiotech). (B) FPS cells were transiently transfected with the full length − 1400/+ 44 CXCL8 promoter and treated with vehicle or 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> for 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. CXCL8 promoter activity was determined by luciferase reporter assay. (C) CXCL8 mRNA expression in Ishikawa FPS cells following treatment of cells for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h with 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub>.

        <p>RCAN1-4 is a negative regulator of CXCL8 mRNA in FPS cells. (A) Ishikawa FPS cells were infected with 1 molecule of infection (MOI) per cell of scrambled lentivirus control or RCAN1-4 ShRNA lentivirus (1 or 2 MOI) as described in the Methods. Immunoblotting was performed using standard techniques using a specific RCAN antibody.β-Actin was used in parallel as a loading control. We confirmed that RCAN1-4 was a negative regulator of CXCL8 expression using a lentiviral ShRNA targeted against RCAN1-4. Infection of FPS cells with the RCAN1-4 lentiviral ShRNA enhanced the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-mediated induction of CXCL8 mRNA (B) and protein (C) expression in FPS cells treated with 1 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> for 8 h compared with control scrambled lentivirus. (D) Ishikawa FPS cells were transiently transfected with the pAP1-luc or pNFAT-luc cDNA containing the AP1 or NFAT cis-acting enhancer elements respectively and infected with either scrambled control adenovirus or RCAN1-4 adenovirus for 24 h. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 100 nM PGF<sub>2α</sub> for 8 h and AP1 and NFAT luciferase activity was measured by luciferase reporter assay. (E) Cell proliferation was determined in Ishikawa FPS cells treated with vehicle or recombinant CXCL8 for 24, 48 and 72 h in the absence/presence of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002.

        <p>Summary. A schematic summary of our findings which includes the points of inhibition of the various inhibitors outlined in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> on the signalling cascade. PGF<sub>2α</sub>-FP receptor activation in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells promotes the induction of RCAN1-4 and CXCL8 via the Gq-PLC-PKC–calcium–calcineurin–NFAT cascade. The expression of RCAN1-4 and CXCL8 are reciprocal and RCAN1-4 expression precedes CXCL8 expression by 4–8 h. We found that RCAN1-4 acts as a negative regulator of the calcineurin pathway to prevent over induction of CXCL8, such that when levels of RCAN1-4 are high, CXCL8 levels are suppressed. When RCAN1-4 levels wane over time, CXCL8 expression is induced to maximal to promote tumour cell proliferation via the CXCR2 receptor on epithelial cells.</p>
