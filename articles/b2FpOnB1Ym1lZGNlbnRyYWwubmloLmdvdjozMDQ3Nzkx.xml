      <abstract>
        <p>The endometrium has a remarkable capacity for efficient repair; however, factors involved remain undefined. Premenstrual progesterone withdrawal leads to increased prostaglandin (PG) production and local hypoxia. Here we determined human endometrial expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and the roles of PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia in its regulation. Endometrial biopsy specimens (<italic>n</italic> = 51) were collected. Endometrial cells and explants were exposed to 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub> or 0.5% O<sub>2</sub>. The endometrial IL-8 concentration peaked during menstruation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and had a significant proangiogenic effect. IL-8 was increased by PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia in secretory but not proliferative explants, which suggests that exposure to progesterone is essential. <italic>In vitro</italic> progesterone withdrawal induced significant IL-8 up-regulation in proliferative explants primed with progestins, but only in the presence of hypoxia. Epithelial cells treated simultaneously with PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia demonstrated synergistic increases in IL-8. Inhibition of HIF-1 by short hairpin RNA abolished hypoxic IL-8 induction, and inhibition of NF-κB by an adenoviral dominant negative inhibitor decreased PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced IL-8 expression (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Increased menstrual IL-8 is consistent with a role in repair. Progesterone withdrawal, hypoxia, and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate endometrial IL-8 by acting via HIF-1 and NF-κB. Hence, progesterone withdrawal may activate two distinct pathways to initiate endometrial repair.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Menstruation exhibits many of the classic hallmarks of inflammation. The withdrawal of progesterone in the late secretory phase of the cycle triggers a cascade of inflammatory mediators, leading to a dramatic influx of leukocytes into the premenstrual endometrium.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> After shedding, the human endometrium exhibits a remarkable and immediate regenerative capacity. This cyclical injury and repair is tightly controlled and, unlike resolution of inflammation at other sites in the body, does not involve loss of function or scarring. However, the precise local mechanisms involved in this efficient repair have not yet been fully elucidated. Aberrations may lead to menstrual disorders including heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea. Delineation of the physiologic processes of the endometrium could result in new therapeutic targets for these common debilitating conditions. In addition, the efficient endometrial model may provide an informative comparator for other tissue sites associated with problematic scarring or persistent inflammation.</p>
    <p>Withdrawal of progesterone occurs in the late secretory endometrium as the corpus luteum regresses. Progesterone withdrawal leads to up-regulation of endometrial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and subsequent increased levels of prostaglandins (PGs), namely, PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub>.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> PGF<sub>2α</sub> induces myometrial contractions and vasoconstriction of the endometrial spiral arterioles. Consequently, it is believed that there is an episode of transient hypoxia in the uppermost endometrial zones. The existence of hypoxia was confirmed in a murine model of menstruation using pimonidazole, a marker of pO<sub>2</sub> less than 10 mm Hg.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The luminal portion of the endometrial functional layer was demonstrated to be intensely hypoxic during simulated menstruation, with negligible detection of pimonidazole by day 5. It was hypothesized that PGF<sub>2α</sub> along with other endometrial vasoconstrictors induces hypoxic conditions in the human perimenstrual endometrium to increase repair gene expression. The role of the other major prostaglandin present during the premenstrual phase, PGE<sub>2,</sub> is not fully understood. It was proposed, therefore, that PGE<sub>2</sub> may also independently increase expression of genes responsible for endometrial repair.</p>
    <p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) is a CXC chemokine, best known for its role as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and T cells.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In addition, it has mitogenic properties and a key role in angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> These processes are fundamental for endometrial shedding and repair. The present study demonstrated significant changes in IL-8 mRNA and protein expression during the menstrual cycle, with maximal expression at menstruation. Concentrations of IL-8 secreted by menstrual endometrium exhibited significantly greater angiogenic potential <italic>in vitro</italic> than did concentrations secreted by mid-secretory endometrium. IL-8 expression is up-regulated in endometrial epithelial cells by hypoxic conditions and by PGE<sub>2</sub>, with a synergistic increase observed in the presence of both factors. An <italic>in vitro</italic> model of progesterone withdrawal also increased IL-8 expression in human endometrial tissue, but only with the addition of hypoxic conditions. The presence of indomethacin, a COX enzyme inhibitor, attenuated the increase in IL-8 expression in this model. These observations suggest a role for progesterone withdrawal in the initiation of endometrial repair and indicate that subsequent hypoxia and PGE<sub>2</sub> are necessary for increased expression of IL-8, an angiogenic factor with a putative role in the repair process.</p>

        <title>Human Endometrial Tissue Collection and Culture</title>
        <p>Human endometrial biopsy specimens were collected from women undergoing hysterectomy or investigation in the gynecologic outpatient setting (<italic>n</italic> = 51). Ethical approval was obtained from the Lothian Research Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before tissue collection. Participants were aged 31 to 52 years (median, 41 years; mean, 41 years). All women reported regular menstrual cycles (duration, 21 to 35 days) and had not taken exogenous hormones or used an intrauterine device during the 3 months before endometrial biopsy. Women with known uterine disease such as large myomas (&gt;3 cm) and endometriosis were excluded. Endometrial biopsy specimens were collected using an endometrial suction curette (Pipelle; Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France). Immediately after collection, tissue was divided and i) placed in RNA stabilization solution (RNA Later; Ambion (Europe) Ltd., Warrington, UK), ii) stored at −70°C for RNA extraction, iii) fixed in neutral buffered formalin for wax embedding or iv) placed in PBS for <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. The specimens were dated according to the criteria of Noyes et al<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> based on histologic appearance, which was consistent with the participants' reported last menstrual period. In addition, serum samples were collected from each woman at biopsy to determine circulating serum progesterone and estradiol concentrations, and were consistent for both last menstrual period and histologic assessment. For analysis, biopsy specimens were classified as proliferative, early secretory, mid secretory, late secretory, or menstrual (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Seven women consented to undergo a second endometrial biopsy, and returned for this procedure three to six months after insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for treatment of subjective report of heavy menstrual bleeding.</p>

        <title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Culture of Endometrial Tissue</title>
        <p>Endometrial biopsy specimens (secretory phase, <italic>n</italic> = 7; proliferative phase, <italic>n</italic> = 3) were divided into three equal explants and incubated for at least 16 hours on raised platforms in 24-well plates just covered with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium plus 50 μg/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml of gentamicin (all from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 8.4 μmol/L of indomethacin. The next day, two explants were treated with vehicle under normoxic conditions, 1 with 21% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> and 37°C, and one with 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub>. The last explant was placed in a sealed hypoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc., Grass Lake, MI) set at 0.5%O<sub>2,</sub> 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> and 37°C for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Five endometrial biopsy specimens from the proliferative phase were divided into 8 equal-sized explants and placed on raised platforms in four wells of 2 × 24-well plates. All explants were treated with 1 μmol/L of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for 24 hours. Explants were then treated with either 1 μmol/L of MPA plus vehicle, 1 μmol/L of MPA plus 8.4 μmol/L of indomethacin (a COX enzyme inhibitor), 1 μmol/L of MPA and 1 μmol/L of RU486 (a progesterone-receptor antagonist) plus vehicle, or 1 μmol/L of MPA and RU486 plus 8.4 μmol/L of indomethacin. One plate was placed in normoxic conditions, and the other in hypoxic conditions, for 48 hours.</p>

        <p>Human Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Centre for Applied Microbiology, Wiltshire, UK) stably expressing the EP2 receptor (EP2S)<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium nutrient mixture F-12 with glutamax-1 and pyridoxine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotic (stock 500 IU/ml of penicillin and 500 μg/ml of streptomycin), and 200 μg/ml of G418 at 37°C. Primary human endometrial stromal cells were isolated from mid-secretory endometrial tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 3) via enzymatic digestion as previously described,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 50 μg/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml of gentamicin (all from Sigma Aldrich).</p>
        <p>Approximately 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> EP2S or 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> human endometrial stromal cells were seeded in 6-well plates. The following day, cells were incubated for at least 16 hours in serum-free culture medium containing antibiotics and 8.4 μmol/L of indomethacin.

Alternatively, EP2S cells were pretreated with vehicle or 5 nmol/L of echinomycin (a specific inhibitor of HIF-1 DNA binding activity).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> After 1 hour, cells were stimulated for 6 hours with vehicle, 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub> with or without 5 nmol/L of echinomycin,or hypoxia with or without 5 nmol/L of echinomycin. A short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence against human HIF-1α and scrambled control oligonucleotide (TIB MOLBIOL) were donated by Prof. T. Cramer (Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany). A 19-nucleotide sequence derived from human HIF-1α mRNA (U22431; bp 1470 to 1489) was used and was termed HIF-1α/shRNA.<xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,11</sup></xref> Cells were transiently transfected with lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 24 hours. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight before treatment with 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub> or placed in the hypoxic chamber for 8 hours. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested, and RNA or protein was extracted for PCR or Western blot analysis. To determine the role of NF-κB in IL-8 up-regulation, EP2S cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>. The following day, cells were infected with an adenovirus containing a dominant-negative Iκ-Bα mutant, which maintains NF-κB in a cytoplasmic location, or control adenovirus (Ad-d1703) at a total multiplicity of infection of 50 for 8 hours. Ad-d1703 and Ad–Iκ-Bα have been described previously.<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> Cells were serum-starved with 8.4 μmol/L of indomethacin for at least 16 hours before treatment with 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub> or hypoxic conditions for 6 hours.</p>

        <p>IL-8 mRNA was present at low levels in endometrium from the proliferative, early secretory, and mid secretory stages of the menstrual cycle. A nonsignificant increase in IL-8 mRNA expression was observed in the late secretory phase. By the menstrual stage, IL-8 concentrations had increased significantly compared with endometrium from the proliferative (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), early secretory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and mid secretory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A.

Endometrium from the menstrual stage secreted significantly higher concentrations of IL-8 protein than did tissue from the early and mid secretory phases (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There was no significant decrease in IL-8 protein between the menstrual and proliferative stages. Immunolocalization of IL-8 demonstrated positive cytoplasmic staining in glandular epithelial, surface epithelial, stromal, and perivascular cells in endometrium from the menstrual phase of the cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, C and D). In contrast, during the mid secretory phase of the cycle, stromal staining was negligible and glandular epithelial cells were only faintly positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, E and F). Semiquantitative scoring of staining intensity revealed that the strongest staining was in the glandular epithelial and perivascular cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). IL-8 perivascular staining was significantly increased during the menstrual phase of the cycle when compared with the proliferative (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), early secretory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and mid secretory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G).

        <p>To assess the angiogenic potential of IL-8 produced by the endometrium, branching of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) was quantified after various treatments. Compared with cells treated with unconditioned medium, cells treated with conditioned medium from menstrual tissue incubated for 24 hours <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrated a significant increase in HUVEC capillary branch point formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). No significant increase in angiogenesis was observed with conditioned medium from mid secretory phase explants. These endometrial explants are likely to produce several angiogenic factors. To assess the contribution of IL-8 alone, HUVECs were also treated with recombinant human IL-8. The mean (SEM; median) amount of IL-8 secreted by menstrual endometrial explants was 18.94 (7.57; 19.4) ng. Mid secretory endometrium secreted the lowest levels of IL-8: 0.53 (0.13; 0.44) ng. Therefore, HUVECs were treated with control medium, 20 ng or 0.5 ng of human recombinant IL-8. Compared with cells treated with 0.5 ng of IL-8 or control medium, treatment of HUVECs with 20 ng of IL-8 resulted in a significantly higher number of capillary tube branch points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).

        <title>IL-8 mRNA Expression Is Increased by PGE<sub>2</sub> and Hypoxia in Secretory Endometrial Tissue</title>
        <p>To investigate the regulation of endometrial IL-8, human endometrial explants were cultured for 24 hours with vehicle, 100 nmol/L of PGE<sub>2</sub>, or hypoxic conditions. Secretory endometrium from seven women demonstrated a nonsignificant increase in IL-8 expression with PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment under normoxic conditions.

        <title><italic>In Vitro</italic> and <italic>in Vivo</italic> Models of Progesterone Withdrawal Increase IL-8 mRNA Expression</title>
        <p>To establish whether progesterone withdrawal induces IL-8 mRNA expression, proliferative endometrial biopsy specimens were divided into 8 explants (<italic>n</italic> = 5). All explants were treated with MPA for 24 hours. After progesterone exposure, progesterone withdrawal was simulated in four of the explants by co-treating with RU486, a progesterone-receptor antagonist. Progesterone withdrawal under normoxic conditions did not significantly up-regulate IL-8 mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>It was postulated that <italic>in vivo</italic>, progesterone withdrawal in the late secretory phase induces synthesis of prostaglandins and constriction of spiral arterioles, resulting in an episode of transient hypoxia. Therefore, to mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> condition more accurately, two endometrial explants were exposed to hypoxic conditions at simulated progesterone withdrawal. Addition of hypoxic conditions induced significant induction of IL-8 mRNA expression 48 hours after progesterone withdrawal (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).</p>
        <p>To assess the contribution of prostaglandins after progesterone withdrawal, explants were concomitantly treated with MPA (progestogen), RU486 (progesterone-receptor antagonist), and indomethacin (a COX enzyme inhibitor). Addition of indomethacin attenuated up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA after progesterone withdrawal under hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).</p>
        <p>To further investigate the role of progesterone and hypoxia in regulating endometrial IL-8 expression, endometrial biopsy specimens from seven women obtained before and 3 to 6 months after LNG-IUS insertion were examined. The LNG-IUS markedly down-regulated the progesterone receptor in all components of the endometrium,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> resulting in a human model of progesterone deficiency. At comparison of endometrium obtained during the proliferative, early secretory, and mid secretory stages with paired samples obtained after 3- to 6-month exposure to LNG-IUS (<italic>n</italic> = 7), significant up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA expression was observed after LNG-IUS exposure (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). This increase in endometrial IL-8 after LNG-IUS insertion was also identified at the protein level.

Endometrial biopsy specimens obtained during the late secretory and menstrual phases (<italic>n</italic> = 2) demonstrated no significant change in IL-8 mRNA expression on exposure to the LNG-IUS (data not shown). This suggests that endometrium already exposed to progesterone withdrawal <italic>in vivo</italic> has no further capacity for IL-8 induction on insertion of LNG-IUS.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, significant menstrual up-regulation of endometrial IL-8 mRNA and protein was observed. The timing of this elevation in IL-8 expression is consistent with the onset of endometrial repair. The data support the hypothesis that progesterone withdrawal followed by increased PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxic conditions up-regulates endometrial repair factor expression. Furthermore, NF-κB and HIF-1 are two transcription factors that have a role in the induction of IL-8 for menstrual repair. Cross-talk between these factors presents a mechanism for the synergistic increase in IL-8 observed when PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia are present simultaneously, as occurs in the perimenstrual endometrium.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have found an increase in IL-8 mRNA and protein expression during the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.<xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19</sup></xref> However, those studies did not examine tissue from the menstrual phase; thus, the maximal increase in IL-8 during this stage was not demonstrated. The finding of significant elevation of IL-8 protein during menstruation is in agreement with the findings of Jones et al,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> who reported undetectable levels of IL-8 mRNA during the menstrual cycle until a dramatic up-regulation at menstruation. As endometrial repair has been shown microscopically to commence on cycle day 2,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> the finding of maximal IL-8 levels during menstruation is consistent with a role in endometrial repair. A recent study of the menstrual endometrium revealed an increase in genes associated with extracellular matrix biosynthesis in stromal cells from the functional layer when compared with those from the basal layer.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Overexpression of these genes, which includes <italic>IL8</italic> (&gt;4-fold increase), suggests that fragments of the functional layer of endometrium participate in endometrial repair.</p>
      <p>IL-8 is a potent chemokine,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and is reported to control the migration and activation of leukocytes during menstruation. A host of chemokines are present in the premenstrual endometrium, including monocyte chemotactic protein-3, eotaxin, fractaline, and 6Ckine (chemokine with 6 cysteines).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> By using a gene array approach and validation with RT-PCR, Jones et al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> demonstrated that of all of the chemokines assessed, only <italic>IL8</italic> was significantly increased in menstrual phase endometrium. Inflammatory cells produce and secrete proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases, that have the ability to break down the extracellular matrix.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Therefore, the maximal expression of IL-8 at menstruation described herein is consistent with a role in chemotaxis and inflammatory cell accumulation in the endometrium, key events in the initiation of menstruation. In addition, leukocytes form an essential component of the endometrial repair process. Neutrophil depletion using the antibody RB6 8C5 markedly delayed endometrial repair in the mouse model of menstruation.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> In addition to its role in neutrophil chemotaxis, IL-8 has important angiogenic properties<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and induces mitogenesis of vascular smooth muscle cells.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> IL-8 interacts with two chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. Both are expressed in the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Therefore, it was postulated that IL-8 has a functional role in human endometrial angiogenesis and repair. The present study demonstrated that menstrual phase endometrial explants have the ability to produce factors with significant angiogenic potential. In addition, the elevated levels of IL-8 present during menstruation have increased angiogenic potential when compared with levels secreted during the mid secretory phase. Numerous angiogenic factors are present in the endometrium during menstruation, including vascular endothelial growth factor,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> the angiopoietins,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and platelet-derived growth factor.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> All likely have a role in vascular proliferation and differentiation, enabling rapid repair of damaged blood vessels. An element of functional redundancy of these factors is to be expected to ensure efficient endometrial repair. Although IL-8 may not be essential for angiogenesis during endometrial repair, the IL-8 protein levels present during menstruation are sufficient for an active contribution to this physiologic process.</p>
      <p>Postmenstrual repair was traditionally considered estrogen-dependent. However, using scanning electron microscopy, Ludwig and Spornitz<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> demonstrated that epithelial cell proliferation and migration commenced on day 2 of the menstrual cycle and that full coverage of the uterine lumen was achieved by day 6. Because estrogen levels remain low throughout the menstrual phase, these observations suggest that initiation of repair may be estrogen-independent. The murine model of menstruation also supports the hypothesis that estrogen is not essential for endometrial repair.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Ovariectomized mice were maintained on a soy-free diet and treated with an aromatase inhibitor to remove all estrogenic influence. When assessed morphologically, no significant difference in the rate of endometrial repair was observed in the complete absence of estrogen. Notwithstanding the limitations of the mouse model of simulated menstruation, these results support findings in the human endometrium that suggest that estrogen is not necessary for repair, although it may contribute to the process. Therefore, it was postulated that progesterone withdrawal rather than an increase in estradiol is the stimulus for endometrial repair factor expression.</p>
      <p>Progesterone withdrawal <italic>in vivo</italic> causes significant up-regulation of endometrial IL-8 mRNA expression after 48 hours.<xref rid="bib1 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,19</sup></xref> However, the mechanisms by which progesterone withdrawal manifests this effect remain undefined. Progesterone withdrawal during the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle results in up-regulation of COX-2, an enzyme responsible for prostaglandin synthesis.<xref rid="bib1 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,30</sup></xref> PGF<sub>2α</sub> is a potent vasoconstrictor.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Premenstrual increases in PGF<sub>2α</sub> and other vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1 result in constriction of spiral arterioles. This causes a transient episode of hypoxia in the functional layer of the endometrium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The hypothesis that hypoxia exists during the perimenstrual phase was derived from classic experiments in the rhesus monkey.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Direct observation of changes in intraocular endometrial implants demonstrated vasoconstriction of the spiral arterioles and a decrease in blood flow. Hypoxia has also been demonstrated in the mouse model of menstruation using pimonidazole.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Furthermore, although some controversy remains about the presence of hypoxia in the human endometrium,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> late secretory and menstrual endometrium exhibits positive nuclear immunohistochemical staining for HIF-1α and CAIX, two markers of hypoxia.<xref rid="bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35,36</sup></xref> Therefore, it is proposed that hypoxia is involved in the initiation of postmenstrual repair factor expression after progesterone withdrawal.</p>
      <p>Herein, it has been demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia independently up-regulate IL-8 mRNA expression in endometrial epithelial cells and in endometrial explants that have had previous progesterone exposure. Endometrial tissue from the proliferative stage, that is, with no significant <italic>in vivo</italic> progesterone exposure, demonstrated no such increase in IL-8 expression with PGE<sub>2</sub> or hypoxia. There was no significant difference in EP2 mRNA expression between explants from the proliferative and secretory phases of the cycle. In addition, previously published data on the endometrial expression of the EP2 receptor demonstrated no significant variation across the menstrual cycle.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These data suggest that the variation observed in explants from various phases of the cycle in response to PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia is not due to differing levels of EP2 receptor expression. When proliferative explants were subjected to an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of progesterone withdrawal using the progesterone-receptor antagonist mifepristone, there was no up-regulation of IL-8 under normoxic conditions. Under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, endometrial architecture is disturbed, and up-regulation of COX-2 and subsequent synthesis of PGF<sub>2α</sub> are unlikely to result in vasoconstriction and local tissue hypoxia. To overcome the limitations of the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system, explants were placed in a hypoxic chamber (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>) at the time of progesterone withdrawal to more accurately simulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment. The addition of hypoxic conditions induced a significant increase in IL-8 mRNA expression 48 hours after progesterone withdrawal, which suggests that hypoxia is necessary for the increase in endometrial repair factors at menstruation. To delineate the contribution of prostaglandins after progesterone withdrawal, the COX inhibitor indomethacin was added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> progesterone withdrawal system. This abrogated the up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA expression, indicating that both prostaglandins and hypoxia are required after progesterone withdrawal for up-regulation of repair factor expression.</p>
      <p>To determine whether a similar human model of progesterone deprivation up-regulated IL-8 expression, endometrial biopsy specimens from women obtained before and after insertion of LNG-IUS were examined. This IUS markedly down-regulates the progesterone receptor in all endometrial compartments,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> resulting in a progesterone-deficient environment that simulates the <italic>in vitro</italic> model used in the present study. The added advantage of this <italic>in vivo</italic> human model is that the endometrial architecture remains intact, enabling the physiologic processes of chemoattraction and vasoconstriction. Previous studies of long-term progestogen exposure have demonstrated reduced endometrial perfusion and profoundly decreased vasomotion, which may induce a relative endometrial hypoxia.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> The results demonstrated that IL-8 mRNA expression in normal endometrium during the proliferative, early, and mid secretory phases is low. Paired samples obtained four to six months after LNG-IUS insertion demonstrated significantly increased IL-8 mRNA expression in all seven women. Levels after IUS insertion were comparable to those observed during the normal menstrual phase. The increased IL-8 mRNA expression in this LNG-IUS human model of progesterone withdrawal is comparable to the finding of significantly elevated IL-8 mRNA expression in endometrial samples from women obtained 48 hours after withdrawal of vaginal progesterone administration compared with mid secretory control endometrium.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
      <p>After progesterone withdrawal during the late secretory phase, both PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia are present in the luminal portion of the endometrium. Therefore, the effect of both PGE<sub>2</sub> plus hypoxic conditions on IL-8 expression in endometrial cells was examined. An Ishikawa endometrial epithelial cell line was used for these studies because primary human glandular endometrial epithelial cells have a limited capacity to proliferate in culture. Treatment with PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia induced a synergistic increase in IL-8 mRNA and protein compared with either treatment alone, which suggests an interaction between the two pathways of IL-8 stimulation. Another endometrial proangiogenic factor, CYR61, has a similar regulation pattern.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Endometrial cells treated with hypoxia and PGE<sub>2</sub> demonstrated a synergistic increase in CYR61 mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistic studies have described CYR61-mediated induction of IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Hence, there is evidence that hypoxia and PGE<sub>2</sub> initiate a perimenstrual angiogenic and tissue repair response by activation of CYR61- and IL-8–mediated signaling.</p>
      <p>HIF-1 and NF-κB are two nuclear transcription factors present in the endometrium during the perimenstrual phase.<xref rid="bib35 bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35,40</sup></xref> The hypoxic response element and the NF-κB binding site have both previously been identified in the IL-8 promoter.<xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,42</sup></xref> Both HIF-1 and NF-κB up-regulate IL-8 mRNA expression in cells from other tissue sites in the body.<xref rid="bib41 bib43 bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,43,44</sup></xref> An adenoviral dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB (Ad–Iκ-Bα) maintains NF-κB in a cytoplasmic location, preventing transcription of its target genes. On infection of endometrial epithelial cells with Ad–Iκ-Bα, there was a significant decrease in PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated IL-8 mRNA up-regulation. Concomitant treatment with hypoxia and echinomycin revealed a significant reduction in hypoxia-mediated IL-8 mRNA expression. These results suggest that PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated IL-8 up-regulation is NF-κB–dependent and that hypoxia-mediated IL-8 up-regulation is HIF-1–mediated. Echinomycin also reduces c-Myc and AP-1 binding by 30% and 50%, respectively,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> and these transcription factors may also contribute to the decrease in IL-8 production. However, specific inhibition of HIF-1α with shRNA also demonstrated a significant reduction in hypoxia-mediated IL-8 expression. This supports the presence of an interaction between NF-kB and HIF-1α to regulate IL-8 expression. There is mounting evidence for cross-talk between NF-κB and HIF-1 in other tissue sites.<xref rid="bib46 bib47 bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46–49</sup></xref> Therefore, the presence of both of these transcription factors and possible cross-talk between them may explain the synergistic up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA observed in endometrial cells exposed to PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxic conditions simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Aberrations in endometrial repair factor expression may lead to prolonged heavy menstrual bleeding. In women with menstrual blood loss in excess of 90 ml the PGF<sub>2α</sub>-PGE<sub>2</sub> ratio is significantly decreased<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> and prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> receptor expression is also decreased.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Excessive PGE<sub>2</sub> production at the expense of PGF<sub>2α</sub> may result in less constriction of the spiral arterioles and an absent or decreased perimenstrual hypoxic insult. If endometrial repair factor expression depends on the interaction between PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia-induced pathways, it can be speculated that endometrial repair processes may be defective in these women as a result of an altered hypoxic episode.</p>
      <p>In summary, IL-8 mRNA and protein are increased in the human endometrium at menstruation. The present data support the hypothesis that progesterone withdrawal, followed by increased PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxic conditions, up-regulates endometrial repair factor expression. Endometrial IL-8 mRNA up-regulation may be mediated by NF-κB and HIF-1. Cross-talk between these two transcription factors presents a mechanism for the synergistic increases in IL-8 observed in endometrial cells when PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxia are present together. Further studies are required to determine whether hypoxic conditions and subsequent repair factor expression are aberrant in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.</p>

        <p>It was hypothesized that up-regulation of IL-8 in the perimenstrual endometrium after progesterone withdrawal occurs by two pathways. Elevation of COX-2 induces synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub>. PGF<sub>2α</sub> is a potent vasoconstrictor and, along with other vasoconstrictors, causes an episode of transient hypoxia in the superficial endometrial zones. It was demonstrated that both PGE<sub>2</sub> and hypoxic conditions can increase endometrial IL-8 mRNA and protein levels, with synergistic increases in IL-8 observed in the presence of both treatments simultaneously. NF-κB and HIF-1α seem to mediate transcription of IL-8 for endometrial repair.</p>
