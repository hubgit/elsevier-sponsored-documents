        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>A fundamental feature of central nervous system development is that neurons are generated before glia. In the embryonic spinal cord, for example, a group of neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) generates motor neurons (MNs), before switching abruptly to oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs). We asked how transcription factor OLIG2 participates in this MN-OLP fate switch. We found that Serine 147 in the helix-loop-helix domain of OLIG2 was phosphorylated during MN production and dephosphorylated at the onset of OLP genesis. Mutating Serine 147 to Alanine (S147A) abolished MN production without preventing OLP production in transgenic mice, chicks, or cultured P19 cells. We conclude that S147 phosphorylation, possibly by protein kinase A, is required for MN but not OLP genesis and propose that dephosphorylation triggers the MN-OLP switch. Wild-type OLIG2 forms stable homodimers, whereas mutant (unphosphorylated) OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> prefers to form heterodimers with Neurogenin 2 or other bHLH partners, suggesting a molecular basis for the switch.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>All the neurons and glial cells of the mature central nervous system (CNS) are generated by neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular zone (VZ) that surrounds the lumen of the embryonic neural tube (forerunner of the spinal cord and brain). Cell diversification occurs in stages. First, a neurogenic prepattern is laid down in the plane of the VZ, under the action of graded morphogens released from organizing centers within or outside the neural tube. This leads to a mosaic of molecularly distinct progenitor domains, each of which goes on to generate a characteristic subset of neurons and glia. Superimposed on this spatial pattern is a temporal pattern of cell generation from some regions of the VZ. For example, in the developing cerebral cortex, different classes of projection neuron are generated in sequence (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2006</xref>); these settle in stereotypic positions to generate the layered structure of the cortex. Subsequently, cortical NSCs start to produce glial lineages (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [OLs]). This late neuron-glial switch is a general property of NSCs in all parts of the developing brain and spinal cord. In some areas of the VZ, NSCs switch from neuron to astrocyte production, whereas other regions generate oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs), which migrate widely before differentiating into myelin-forming OLs (<xref rid="bib46 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rowitch, 2004; Richardson et al., 2006</xref>). Less is known about the temporal control of cell fate than the spatial patterning that precedes it. We set out to study this temporal aspect of cell diversification, focusing on neuron-glial switching in the ventral spinal cord.</p>
      <p>Spatial pattern in the ventral half of the developing spinal cord is established largely through the action of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein released from the notochord and floor plate at the ventral midline. SHH activates or inhibits different sets of transcription factors at different distances from the floor plate (different concentrations of SHH). Subsequently, cross-repressive interactions among the transcription factors expressed in adjacent regions of the VZ establish sharp boundaries of gene expression in the dorsal-ventral axis, establishing a set of ribbon-like NSC domains that run parallel to one another along the neuraxis. In the ventral half of the cord, these domains are known (from ventral to dorsal) as p3, pMN, p2, p1, and p0 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jessell, 2000</xref>). Six additional NSC domains (dP1–dP6, dorsal to ventral) are formed in the dorsal half of the spinal cord under the influence of BMPs and WNTs secreted from the roof plate (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Helms and Johnson, 2003</xref>). NSCs in the ventral pMN domain generate several different subtypes of motor neuron (MN) before switching abruptly to OLP production (reviewed by <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>). NSCs in the neighboring p3 and p2 domains generate interneurons followed by astrocytes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rowitch et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>The pMN domain contributes all of the MNs and ∼80% of the OLPs in the mouse spinal cord (<xref rid="bib15 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Fogarty, 2006; Richardson et al., 2006</xref>). The remaining OLPs are generated outside pMN in a SHH-independent manner (<xref rid="bib7 bib14 bib63" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2005; Fogarty et al., 2005; Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). pMN is marked by transcription factor OLIG2 and its close relative OLIG1, which were originally identified in screens for OL-specific genes (<xref rid="bib33 bib58 bib73" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2000; Takebayashi et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). OLIG2 knockout results in loss of the pMN domain and consequently complete absence of spinal MNs (<xref rid="bib34 bib59 bib72 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002; Takebayashi et al., 2002; Zhou and Anderson, 2002; Park et al., 2002</xref>). All spinal OL lineage cells are lost as well because OLIG2 is required for OLP development regardless of whether they are generated within or outside of pMN (<xref rid="bib34 bib59 bib72 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002; Takebayashi et al., 2002; Zhou and Anderson, 2002; Park et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, OLIG1 has a relatively mild impact on normal development (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; J.P.d.F., N. Kessaris, W.D.R., and H.L., unpublished data; but see <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Xin et al., 2005</xref>). However, OLIG1 is believed to be crucial for OL regeneration in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arnett et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The OLIG gene products are members of a large family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors, which also includes proneural proteins Neurogenin1/2 (NGN1/2) and MASH1/ASCL1 as well as cell lineage regulators MYOD and NEUROD. OLIG2 interacts with different protein partners to regulate specific developmental processes. It can form heterodimers with NGN2 to control MN differentiation, and it can bind NKX2.2 to promote OLP generation and/or differentiation (<xref rid="bib38 bib74 bib43 bib57 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Novitch et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001; Qi et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2005</xref>). It can also complex with SOX10 or ZFP488 to regulate OLP differentiation and enhance myelin gene expression (<xref rid="bib66 bib68 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006; Wissmuller et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given the central role of OLIG2 in both MN and OL development, we were keen to discover how this one transcription factor can specify two quite different cell types and especially how it participates in the MN-OLP temporal fate switch. We present evidence that OLIG2 controls the switch by reversible phosphorylation on Serine 147 (S147), a predicted protein kinase A (PKA) target; phosphorylation at this site is required for patterning of the ventral neuroepithelium and MN specification, whereas dephosphorylation favors OLP specification. S147 phosphorylation also causes OLIG2 to switch its preferred dimerization partner from OLIG2 (or OLIG1) to NGN2. We propose that this regulated exchange of cofactors is required for and triggers the MN-OLP fate switch.</p>

        <title>OLIG2 Is Reversibly Phosphorylated on Serine 147</title>
        <p>OLIG2 is rich in serine and threonine residues (50 serines and 14 threonines out of a total of 323 amino acids; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref> available online), suggesting that it might possess multiple serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. To test this, we transfected a Myc epitope-tagged OLIG2 expression vector into Cos-7 cells, labeled the cells with [<sup>33</sup>P]phosphate, and analyzed radiolabeled OLIG2 proteins by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Myc followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Two major radioactive OLIG2 bands were visible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Separation of <italic>Olig2</italic>-transfected Cos-7 cell lysates by two-dimensional (2D) PAGE (pH gradient in the second dimension) followed by Western blotting (WB) confirmed that OLIG2 was phosphorylated on multiple sites and that most of the phosphates could be removed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1F). Bioinformatic analysis of OLIG2 using online services NetPhos 2.0 Server (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blom et al., 1999</xref>) and NetPhosK 1.0 Server (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blom et al., 2004</xref>) identified one potential PKA and one potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Alignment of OLIG2 protein sequences from different species revealed that the predicted PKA site (R[R/K]X[S/T]) (X, any amino acid)—at S147 in the bHLH Helix-2 (H2) domain—is conserved during evolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). This site is also conserved in OLIG1 but not in NGN1–3 or other bHLH proteins examined. We mutated S147 to Alanine (S147A), transfected the mutant (<italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic>) and wild-type (<italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic>) constructs into Cos-7 cells, and visualized OLIG2 proteins by 2D PAGE and WB as before. This revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern of OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), indicating that S147 is a bone fide phosphate acceptor. Moreover, cotransfection of <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic> with a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of PKA (dnPKA) strongly reduced the phosphoprotein signal in the low pH range of the 2D gel (the region affected by S147A mutation), implying that OLIG2 can be phosphorylated by PKA on several sites, including S147 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>OLIG2-S147 Is Phosphorylated In Vivo during MN Development</title>
        <p>To examine OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation status directly, we raised an antiserum in rabbits against a custom phosphopeptide and purified an antibody fraction that specifically recognizes the S147-phosphorylated form of OLIG2 (anti-OLIG2 <sup>ph-S147</sup>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). We prepared nuclear extracts of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), E11.5, and E13.5 mouse spinal cord tissue, immunoprecipitated endogenous OLIG2 protein with a goat anti-OLIG2 antibody, and visualized the precipitates by PAGE and WB with either rabbit anti-OLIG2 or rabbit anti-OLIG2 <sup>ph-S147</sup>. OLIG2 was expressed more or less equally at all stages examined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G). The specific phosphorylated form OLIG2 <sup>ph-S147</sup> was present at E9.5 and to a lesser extent at E11.5 (∼3.2-fold decrease; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) but was not detected at E13.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H). These results demonstrate that endogenous OLIG2 is phosphorylated on S147 during MN production (∼E9–12) but is later dephosphorylated, coinciding with the switch from MN to OLP production that occurs around E12.5 in mice (<xref rid="bib42 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pringle et al., 1996; Richardson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mutation of S147 to Alanine Changes the Protein Binding Properties of OLIG2</title>
        <p>Given the location of the S147 phosphorylation site in the bHLH domain, it seemed likely that the phosphorylation status of this site might affect the interactions of OLIG2 with other proteins or with DNA. OLIG2 can form strong homodimers with itself as well as heterodimers with OLIG1 but forms weak heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as E12 or NGN2 (<xref rid="bib28 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007</xref>). It also interacts physically with other non-bHLH transcription factors, including SOX10, NKX2.2, and ZFP488 (<xref rid="bib30 bib57 bib66 bib68" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2006; Wissmuller et al., 2006</xref>). We compared the cofactor-binding properties of OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> and OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> by coIP assays in transfected Cos-7 cells and found that, compared to OLIG2<sup>WT</sup>, OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> had a reduced ability to form OLIG2-OLIG2 and OLIG2-OLIG1 dimers, whereas binding to NKX2.2, SOX10, or MASH1 was unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A). In contrast, OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> complexed more readily with NGN2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Together, these experiments indicate that S147A mutation does not destabilize OLIG2 or grossly affect its structure but, nevertheless, alters its binding to transcriptional partners.</p>
        <p>We tried to mimic constitutive phosphorylation by mutating S147 to glutamic acid (E) or aspartic acid (D). However, both OLIG2<sup>S147E</sup> and OLIG2<sup>S147D</sup> exhibited reduced homodimer formation just like OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> (data not shown). This sort of effect is not unique to OLIG2. For example, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues of the bHLH transcription factor HAND1 have been shown to regulate homodimer versus heterodimer formation, phosphorylation favoring heterodimers of HAND1 and E proteins and dephosphorylation favoring HAND1 homodimers (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Firulli et al., 2003</xref>). However, mutation of the key serine/threonine phosphate acceptors to aspartic acid did not inhibit HAND1 homodimer formation, as would have been expected if these substitutions had mimicked constitutive phosphorylation, but instead strengthened homodimer formation just like serine/threonine → alanine substitution (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Firulli et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also compared the binding properties of OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> and OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> using a mammalian two-hybrid system (CheckMate System, Promega) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B–2E). This is a bipartite assay that depends on the physical association of test and target proteins at the promoter of a <italic>Luciferase</italic> reporter gene in Cos-7 cells, so activating Luciferase expression, which can be quantified by chemiluminescence. This assay confirmed the results of co-IP, namely, that association of OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> with an OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> target was strongly reduced relative to either an OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> or OLIG1 target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). In contrast, and also in agreement with the co-IP data, association of NGN2 with OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> was enhanced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Furthermore, cotransfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA enhanced formation of OLIG2-OLIG2 and OLIG2-OLIG1 dimers while inhibiting OLIG2-NGN2 dimer formation, whereas a dnPKA had the opposite effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B–2E). In summary, phosphorylation of OLIG2 on S147, possibly by PKA, has a dramatic effect on cofactor choice, favoring NGN2 over other potential partners.</p>
        <p>In addition we assessed the DNA binding activities of OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> and OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> exhibited significantly weaker binding to the HB9/M100 E box (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) compared to OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>B). Given that dimerization is needed for bHLH proteins to bind to DNA targets (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murre et al., 1989</xref>), this result most likely reflects the reduced efficiency of OLIG2 homodimer formation as a result of S147A mutation.</p>

        <title>OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> Mutant Mice</title>
        <p>In order to study the phenotypic consequences of OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation in vivo, we generated <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mutant mice. We modified OLIG2-coding sequence in an <italic>Olig2</italic> PAC clone (not containing <italic>Olig1</italic>), introducing the S147A mutation while simultaneously adding a V5 epitope tag to the C terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection. V5-tagged <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> and <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic> mice were made in parallel and single-copy founders of both lines were selected for further study (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that the <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> and <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic> PAC transgenes were faithfully expressed in the embryonic spinal cords of both lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). We subsequently removed the endogenous <italic>Olig2</italic> alleles by crossing the PAC transgenes into an <italic>Olig2</italic> null background (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>), thereby obtaining single-copy <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> and <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic> lines (i.e., <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic>:<italic>Olig2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic>:<italic>Olig2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>). For some experiments we also bred the PAC transgenics with <italic>Olig1/Olig2</italic> double-null mice (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Anderson, 2002</xref>), which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under transcriptional control of <italic>Olig2</italic> (see below).</p>

        <title>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup> Mice Lack the pMN Precursor Domain in the Ventral VZ</title>
        <p>Progenitors in p3, the ventral-most progenitor domain of the embryonic spinal cord, express the transcription factor NKX2.2, whereas progenitors in the p2 domain express IRX3 and a high level of PAX6 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>). The pMN domain lies between p3 and p2 and is marked by expression of OLIG2 and a low level of PAX6 (<xref rid="bib33 bib73" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). OLIG2 is essential for establishing and maintaining the pMN domain through cross-regulatory interactions with transcription factors in neighboring domains. For example, OLIG2 represses expression of <italic>Irx3</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> ; in the absence of OLIG2 function, <italic>Irx3</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are derepressed in pMN, which takes on the character of p2, generating V2 interneurons and astrocytes instead of MNs and OLPs (<xref rid="bib34 bib72" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002; Zhou and Anderson, 2002</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). This can be regarded as a “homeotic” transformation pMN → p2. We found that the pMN domain specifically was missing in our <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D). Moreover, in <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup>:Olig2 <sup>GFP/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Olig1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> embryos, most pMN precursors (marked by GFP) were observed to adopt a p2 fate (high PAX6 expression) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>).

At the time of their first appearance, OLPs were scattered through all regions of the cord, not concentrated in the ventral cord as in wild-type mice. This is consistent with the demonstrated loss of the ventral pMN domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>)—the source of most but not all OLPs in the cord—and suggests that S147 phosphorylation is not required for OLP specification from other progenitor domains that do not rely on the prior neuroepithelial patterning function of OLIG2. We further investigated the effect of S147 phosphorylation on OLP differentiation into myelin-forming OLs by culturing primary E18.5 spinal cord cells under conditions permissive for OL differentiation. (It was not possible to study OL differentiation in vivo since <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mutants die at birth due to the lack of MNs.)

        <p>To investigate further the role of OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation in neural fate determination, we turned to an in vitro assay using P19 cells. This pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC)-derived cell line can differentiate into different cell lineages under appropriate inductive conditions (<xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jones-Villeneuve et al., 1982, 1983</xref>). For example, cell aggregation together with retinoic acid (RA) treatment drives the differentiation of P19 cells toward a neural fate, even as early as 4 hr postinduction (<xref rid="bib3 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Berg and McBurney, 1990; Staines et al., 1996</xref>). We treated aggregated P19 cells with RA together with the SHH small-molecule agonist SHHAg1.2, a combination that can initiate MN development in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>). We found that RA/SHHAg1.2 also induced the MN marker HB9 in aggregated P19 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). Furthermore, this treatment induced expression of proteoglycan NG2, which marks OLPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>E and 6F).</p>
        <p>To study the influence of OLIG2 on neural differentiation of P19 cells, we constructed two stable P19 lines that constitutively expressed V5-tagged OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> or OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup>. Without RA/SHHAg1.2 induction, both cell lines grew and behaved like the parent P19 line. With RA/SHHAg1.2 induction, the P19-OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> line produced significantly increased numbers of HB9-positive cells (p &lt; 0.001) and NG2-positive cells (p &lt; 0.05) compared to induced P19 control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and 6G).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that phosphorylation of OLIG2 on S147 is required for the early functions of OLIG2 in neuroepithelial patterning and MN specification but is subsequently dispensable for OLP specification. We have also shown that S147 is phosphorylated during MN specification in the ventral spinal cord, dephosphorylated at the onset of OLP production, and that that dephosphorylation switches the binding preference of OLIG2 away from OLIG1/2 toward NGN2. We believe that this represents a key part of the regulatory mechanism that operates through OLIG2 to switch NSC fate from MNs to OLPs during ventral spinal cord development. Other phosphorylation events might also be important for the functional regulation of OLIG2, e.g., it was recently shown that casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation is required for the oligodendrogenic activity of OLIG2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Huillard et al., 2010</xref>). Serine phosphorylation of NGN2 by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has also been shown to promote MN specification by facilitating assembly of NGN2 into a transcriptional complex with homeodomain factors LHX3 and ISL1/2 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2008</xref>). It seems that phosphorylation of bHLH proteins (and perhaps other posttranslational modifications) might be a common means of regulating cell fate and lineage progression.</p>

        <title>OLIG2-S147 Phosphorylation and the MN-OL Fate Switch</title>
        <p>Our data reveal that gain or loss of a phosphate group on OLIG2-S147 goes hand in hand with MN or OL generation, respectively. In our <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mice, the pMN domain was transformed mainly to p2, and consequently, MN development was blocked. This does not reflect a global loss of OLIG2 function because expression studies in Cos-7 cells demonstrated that OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> is a stable protein that is indistinguishable from OLIG2<sup>WT</sup> by mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, subcellular localization, or its ability to bind known transcriptional partners such as SOX10 or NKX2.2. Most importantly, OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> did not lose its ability to specify OL lineage cells, although fewer OLPs than normal developed in the spinal cords of <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mice, and these were delayed, appearing at E15.5–17.5 instead of E12.5 as in wild-type cord. This fits with the fact that the pMN progenitor domain, which normally produces ∼80% of all OLPs in the cord, is lost in the mutant. The remaining ∼20% of OLPs are produced from more dorsal progenitor domains, which do not depend on the neuroepithelial patterning function of OLIG2 (<xref rid="bib7 bib14 bib63" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2005; Fogarty et al., 2005; Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). These dorsally derived OLPs are generated later than pMN-derived OLPs (∼E16.5 versus E12.5). They still require OLIG2 function for their development, for in <italic>Olig2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice there are no spinal OLPs whatsoever (<xref rid="bib34 bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002; Takebayashi et al., 2002</xref>). It is very likely that the late-forming OLPs found in the <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mutant correspond to these dorsally derived OLPs. The fact that they arise in the mutant demonstrates that the OLP-inducing function of OLIG2 is separable and distinct from its neuroepithelial patterning and MN-inducing functions. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> cannot induce ectopic MNs in chick electroporation experiments, yet can still induce the OL lineage marker <italic>Sox10</italic>. Moreover, <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> induces <italic>Sox10</italic> on an accelerated time course compared to <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic>, suggesting that <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> instructs NSCs to “leapfrog” MN production and go straight to OLPs. This separation between the MN- and OLP-inducing functions of OLIG2 was also strikingly confirmed by cell culture experiments; P19 cells (NSC-like) stably transfected with an <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> expression vector generated many more OL lineage cells—both NG2<sup>+</sup> OLPs and MBP<sup>+</sup> OLs—and less HB9<sup>+</sup> MNs than did P19 cells stably transfected with <italic>Olig2<sup>WT</sup></italic>. The MBP<sup>+</sup> cells that formed in these experiments did not adopt the multiprocess-bearing morphology typical of normal OLs in culture, so other factors in addition to OLIG2 are presumably required for full OL differentiation of P19 cells.</p>
        <p>We found that OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> has an enhanced ability to bind NGN2, coupled with a diminished ability to form dimers with itself or OLIG1. Consistent with this, we found that OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> inhibits NGN2-mediated transcriptional activation of the <italic>HB9</italic> promoter more efficiently than does OLIG2<sup>WT</sup>, in cotransfection assays with an HB9:luciferase reporter (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S6</xref>). NGN2 is a bHLH transcription factor that is known to be required for MN development because spinal MNs are not formed properly in mice lacking NGN2 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Scardigli et al., 2001</xref>). OLIG2 and NGN2 are coexpressed in the pMN domain and nowhere else, implying that OLIG2 and NGN2 act in concert during MN development (<xref rid="bib36 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mizuguchi et al., 2001; Novitch et al., 2001</xref>). There is evidence that OLIG2/NGN2 coexpression drives NSCs to exit the cell cycle and start expressing pan-neuronal markers (<xref rid="bib36 bib38 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mizuguchi et al., 2001; Novitch et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2005</xref>). NGN2 expression is later downregulated in pMN, and this was suggested to be necessary to enable pMN progenitors to switch from MN to OLP production (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). However, in the light of our current data, we believe that NGN2 downregulation is not the trigger but rather a consequence of the MN-OLP switch that reinforces and stabilizes the gliogenic state.</p>
        <p>Taken together with previous research, our data provide new ideas about the chain of events leading up to and beyond the MN-OLP fate switch. We propose that during the early neurogenic phase (∼E9–E12), homodimers of S147-phosphorylated OLIG2 act to repress OL lineage genes in pMN and create a permissive environment for MN development—in which NGN2 plays an important role in concert with homeodomain transcription factors ISL1/2 and LHX3 (<xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Pfaff, 2003; Lee et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequently, dephosphorylation of OLIG2-S147 disrupts OLIG2 homodimers and encourages formation of heterodimers such as OLIG2/NGN2, thereby sequestering NGN2 and possibly other bHLH factors and shutting down MN lineage genes. At the same time, OLIG2 associates with other unidentified cofactors to activate the OL genetic program and repress the MN program (including NGN2), hence reinforcing the neuron-glial switch. This scheme is illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. However, we note that endogenous MN development did not appear to be inhibited in OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup>:OLIG2<sup>+/−</sup> mice (data not shown) or in OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup>-electroporated chick (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L), which could be taken to argue against the simple sequestration model depicted. However, it is possible that in both these situations OLIG2<sup>S147A</sup> expression might not have been robust enough to completely overcome endogenous OLIG2 function.</p>
        <p>A potential partner of OLIG2 that might come into play during OL lineage specification is NKX2.2. Forced expression of OLIG2 together with NKX2.2 in chick neural tube induces early onset of OLP specification (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, OLIG2 and NKX2.2 can physically interact with each other (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2003</xref>). However, OLIG2 and NKX2.2 are not tightly colocalized in the pMN domain in the run up to MN-OLP fate switching in mice (<xref rid="bib55 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 1998; Richardson et al., 2006</xref>), so it is not clear that OLIG2 and NKX2.2 normally work together in OLP specification. In fact, OLPs develop normally in NKX2.2 null mice, although their subsequent differentiation into OLs is prevented (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2001</xref>). Another potential cofactor for OLIG2 is MASH1/ASCL1; initially (∼E12.5) there are reduced numbers of OLPs in MASH1 null spinal cords, but this soon resolves, suggesting that MASH1 is not critical for OLP specification (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sugimori et al., 2008</xref>). We found that S147A mutation did not have a noticeable effect on binding of OLIG2 to either NKX2.2 or MASH1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A), so we probably have to look elsewhere for critical determinants of OL lineage specification in the spinal cord. The transcription factor NF1A has been proposed to trigger gliogenesis throughout the neural tube (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Deneen et al., 2006</xref>), but its physical and functional relationships with OLIG2 have yet to be investigated. Recently, OLIG2 was shown to interact with the bHLH protein E47 to directly activate the <italic>Sox10-U2</italic> promoter in the OL lineage (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Küspert et al., 2010</xref>). The results of our present study suggest that dephosphorylated OLIG2<sup>S147</sup> might specifically interact with E47 in this context.</p>
        <p>Epigenetic modifications play an important part in cell fate decisions, including OLP specification. For example, in the absence of histone deacetylases 1 and/or 2 (HDAC1/2), OLP formation in the ventral spinal cord is disrupted (<xref rid="bib8 bib70 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Cunliffe and Casaccia-Bonnefil, 2006; Ye et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009</xref>). It will be important in the future to investigate the potential interactions between OLIG2, HDACs, and other histone modifiers (e.g., methylases) and how these interactions might be influenced by posttranslational modification.</p>

        <title>The Role of PKA</title>
        <p>Our study focused on reversible phosphorylation of OLIG2-S147, an evolutionarily conserved site that is predicted to be a PKA target. We provided evidence that OLIG2-S147 can be phosphorylated by PKA in cultured Cos-7 cells and that dnPKA inhibits phosphorylation. Despite this, we cannot conclude that PKA is the only—or even the primary—protein serine kinase to target S147 in vivo. For example, the consensus target sequence for PKA (R[R/K]X[S/T]) can overlap with that of PKC ([R/K]X[S/T]U[R/K]) (U, hydrophobic). Indeed, PKA and PKC are thought to phosphorylate common acceptor sites on the bHLH proteins HAND1 and HAND2 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Firulli et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the fact that <italic>Olig2<sup>S147A</sup></italic> mice failed to develop MNs suggests that PKA might normally play a positive role in MN development. This seems counter to the popular idea that PKA negatively regulates the SHH pathway (<xref rid="bib31 bib48 bib12 bib17 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1995; Ruiz i Altaba, 1999; Epstein et al., 1996; Hammerschmidt et al., 1996; Jacob and Briscoe, 2003</xref>). SHH signaling works through the transcription factors GLI1–3, vertebrate homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cubitus interruptus (Ci). SHH activates GLI3 (and GLI2) by inducing its proteolytic conversion from a full-length transcriptional activator into a truncated N-terminal repressor (<xref rid="bib49 bib9 bib64" ref-type="bibr">Ruppert et al., 1990; Dai et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000</xref>). It is believed that PKA phosphorylation stimulates GLI3 cleavage (<xref rid="bib64 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000; Tempe et al., 2006</xref>), which might underlie the repressive action of PKA on SHH signaling since truncated GLI3 represses the SHH pathway (<xref rid="bib9 bib64 bib2 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000; Bai et al., 2004; Tempe et al., 2006</xref>). GLI3 is not the only component of the SHH pathway that can be PKA phosphorylated, and PKA has been shown to play a positive as well as a negative role in SHH signaling. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PKA phosphorylation of SMO, the Hedgehog (HH) coreceptor, promotes SMO accumulation on the primary cilium and triggers HH pathway activation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2004</xref>). Also, during limb development, elevating PKA activity by Forskolin treatment or by infecting with a retroviral PKA expression vector exerts a positive effect on SHH signaling, resulting in an altered pattern of digits (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Tiecke et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>We examined the effect of stimulating the PKA pathway in neonatal mouse cortical cell cultures with Forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, and found that the number of NG2-positive OLPs was significantly decreased compared to untreated cultures (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>). This is consistent with expectation since our other data predict that elevating PKA activity should increase OLIG2-S147 phosphorylation and stimulate neurogenesis at the expense of OLPs. However, in the light of the above discussion, it is clear that PKA probably has multiple parallel functions, and our experiments with Forskolin/db-cAMP should be interpreted cautiously.</p>

        <title>What Signals S147 Dephosphorylation?</title>
        <p>Our data raise the obvious question: What is the key event that signals S147 dephosphorylation and triggers the MN-OLP switch in pMN? Notch signaling is known to play an important role in glial cell development in the CNS (<xref rid="bib65 bib39 bib41 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1998; Park and Appel, 2003; Park et al., 2005; Deneen et al., 2006</xref>). Constitutive activation of components of the Notch pathway in chick spinal cord can downregulate NGN2 expression in pMN and initiate OLP generation (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). Notch1 is expressed by neuroepithelial cells throughout the neural tube, and its ligand Jagged-2 is expressed exclusively in the pMN domain of zebrafish spinal cord during late neurogenesis (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Yeo and Chitnis, 2007</xref>). These and other observations frame the Notch pathway as a potential key player in the MN-OLP switch. It is possible that activated Notch-1, via its effector HES5, might induce expression of specific phosphatases and/or repress phosphatase inhibitors, resulting in dephosphorylation of OLIG2-S147 and initiation of OLP production. It will be worth exploring these ideas in the future. By improving our understanding of OL lineage specification, this work might aid the design of procedures for efficient large-scale production of OL lineage cells for clinical use—cell replacement therapy for demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, for example—or for high-throughput drug screens. Study of the posttranslational pathways that modulate transcriptional activity of OLIG2, NGN2 and other related factors might also provide insights into general mechanisms of stem cell fate choice.</p>

The antiserum was first absorbed on a column containing nonphosphorylated peptide and then affinity purified on a phosphopeptide column. The purified antibody was used in WB at a dilution of 1:250. Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence labeling were: goat anti-OLIG2 (R&amp;D Systems; 1:750); rabbit anti-OLIG2 (from Charles Stiles; 1:4000); chick anti-GFP (Aveslab; 1:1000); rabbit anti-V5 (Abcam; 1:250); rabbit anti-Pax6 (Chemicon; 1:500); mouse anti-Nkx2.2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [DSHB] supernatant; 1:50); mouse anti-HB9 (DSHB; 1:20); guinea pig anti-SOX10 (a gift from Michael Wegner, Erlanger University, Germany; 1:2000); and rat anti-PDGFRa (BD PharMingen; 1:400). Secondary antibodies for WB were bought from Thermo Pierce and used at 1:20,000. Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen (used at 1:750 dilution). The in situ hybridization probes for mouse <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> were described previously (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Tekki-Kessaris et al., 2001</xref>). The chick <italic>Sox10</italic> probe was generated by in vitro transcription from a plasmid containing a chick <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic fragment.</p>

Lysis buffer for spinal cord tissue was purchased from Sigma (CelLytic MT); sometimes phosphatase inhibitors were included. After lysis, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g, then 500 μl cell lysate was treated with 50 U of DNase1 and precleared with 30 μl of protein G beads (GE Healthcare) for 3 hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The supernatant was decanted, incubated with the antibody of interest at 4°C for 1 hr, mixed with 30 μl of protein G beads, and incubated overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% [v/v] Nonidet P-40, 0.05% [w/v] sodium deoxycholate) and once in low-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS gel sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by WB. Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. For 2D PAGE the beads were treated with Invitrogen ZOOM Protein Solubilizer, and protein samples were separated on the Invitrogen ZOOM 2D gel system following the manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECLplus kit; GE Healthcare).</p>
