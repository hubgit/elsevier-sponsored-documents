        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p><italic>N</italic>uclear abundant poly(<italic>A</italic>) RNA-<italic>b</italic>inding protein 2 (Nab2) is an essential yeast heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein that modulates both mRNA nuclear export and poly(A) tail length. The N-terminal domain of Nab2 (residues 1–97) mediates interactions with both the C-terminal globular domain of the nuclear pore-associated protein, myosin-like protein 1 (Mlp1), and the mRNA export factor, Gfd1. The solution and crystal structures of the Nab2 N-terminal domain show a primarily helical fold that is analogous to the PWI fold found in several other RNA-binding proteins. In contrast to other PWI-containing proteins, we find no evidence that the Nab2 N-terminal domain binds to nucleic acids. Instead, this domain appears to mediate protein:protein interactions that facilitate the nuclear export of mRNA. The Nab2 N-terminal domain has a distinctive hydrophobic patch centered on Phe73, consistent with this region of the surface being a protein:protein interaction site. Engineered mutations within this hydrophobic patch attenuate the interaction with the Mlp1 C-terminal domain but do not alter the interaction with Gfd1, indicating that this patch forms a crucial component of the interface between Nab2 and Mlp1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene expression depends on the production of mature mRNA transcripts that must be exported from their site of synthesis in the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. This complex multistep process can be conveniently subdivided into three distinct stages: generation of mature mRNP export complexes in the nucleus, their equilibration between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and disassembly of the export complex in the cytoplasm that prevents its return to the nucleus.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–5</sup></xref> The generation of export-competent mRNPs is a prerequisite for nuclear export and represents the culmination of transcription, addition of a 5′-cap to the transcript, splicing out of introns, and cleavage and polyadenylation of the 3′-end.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> Following completion of these processing steps, the mature transcript must be translocated to the cytoplasm where it can interface with the translation machinery. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA synthesis, processing, and export are coordinated.<xref rid="bib2 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,6</sup></xref> This coordination is achieved via a large number of mRNA-binding proteins that interact with the transcript from transcription through translation and ultimately to its destruction. The export of mature mRNPs through NPCs is mediated primarily by an evolutionarily conserved heterodimer, termed Mex67:Mtr2 in yeast, via its transient interactions with phenylalanine glycine repeat-containing proteins of the nuclear pore called FG nucleoporins.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–3,5</sup></xref> When the export complex reaches the cytoplasm, the RNA helicase, Dbp5, and Gle1 mediate its disassembly, and this process has been proposed to function as a molecular ratchet that prevents the return of the mRNP to the nucleus.<xref rid="bib5 bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,7–9</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Cells require an efficient mechanism to establish when mRNA is mature and competent for export. Thus, there are a number of cellular quality-control mechanisms that work actively to destroy improperly processed transcripts and preferentially export correctly processed mRNA to complement the cellular factors that assure coordinated production and export of correct mRNA transcripts.<xref rid="bib2 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,10,11</sup></xref> The nuclear exosome, a complex of 3′–5′ riboexonucleases, can detect and destroy aberrant or incorrectly processed transcripts within the nucleus.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Several additional quality-control mechanisms function posttranscriptionally and include the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, which recognizes transcripts with defects such as premature stop codons,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and the nonstop decay pathway, which recognizes transcripts lacking a stop codon.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Recognition of transcripts by any of these pathways leads to their destruction. In addition to these “search-and-destroy” quality-control mechanisms in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, recent work has uncovered evidence in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that surveillance of mRNA can also occur at the nuclear pore.<xref rid="bib2 bib10 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,10,15,16</sup></xref> These studies suggest that specific interactions between mRNA-binding proteins associated with a given transcript and the evolutionarily conserved myosin-like protein 1 (Mlp1), located at the inner nuclear basket of the NPC,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> can influence nuclear export of that transcript. For example, if introns are retained in a transcript, interactions between splicing factors and Mlp1 lead to retention of the transcript in the nucleus.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are important in orchestrating the different steps of the gene expression pathway.<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–3</sup></xref> One important hnRNP function is to sort export-competent mRNPs and concentrate them in the vicinity of NPCs to facilitate export. <italic>N</italic>uclear abundant poly(<italic>A</italic>) RNA-<italic>b</italic>inding protein (Nab2) is an essential multidomain hnRNP that is required for the nuclear export of poly(A) mRNA in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.<xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19</sup></xref> Nab2 is also involved in poly(A) tail length control<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and has been proposed to provide a link between the termination of polyadenylation and mRNA nuclear export. Nab2 interacts with Mlp1, which is constructed from a long α-helical coiled coil and a globular C-terminal domain<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> that binds to Nab2.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Overexpression of Mlp1 or its C-terminal domain causes retention of both Nab2 and poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in the nucleus.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Mlp1 is itself attached to the nucleoplasmic face of NPCs and, hence, is thought to facilitate coordination of several steps in mRNA metabolism,<xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> albeit the Mlp proteins are not essential for cell growth.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Because it both recognizes the presence of a poly(A) tail and interacts with Mlp1, Nab2 is an attractive candidate to participate in the final step of the nuclear portion of the gene expression pathway.</p>
      <p>Nab2 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is thought to interact with transcripts following 3′-end cleavage and addition of the poly(A) tail.<xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19,22</sup></xref> Thus, Nab2 and other shuttling mRNA-binding proteins could serve as positive markers to target mature transcripts for preferential export from the nucleus. The Nab2 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a) has a modular structure based on four functional domains:<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> a unique N-terminal domain of approximately 100 residues, a glutamine-rich linker, an RGG domain, and a Zn-finger domain. Deletion analysis indicates that the N-terminal domain is necessary for the nuclear export of both poly(A) RNA and Nab2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with a model in which Nab2 associates with mRNA in the nucleus and in which the N-terminal domain facilitates export of both poly(A) mRNA and Nab2.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The RGG domain, which contains the nuclear localization sequence<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> recognized by the nuclear import factor Kap104 (also known as transportin or Kapβ2), is required for the nuclear import of Nab2<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> to recycle it for another round of mRNA export. The Zn-finger domain is critical for Nab2 binding to polyadenosine mRNA.<xref rid="bib22 bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,26</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacts with the export factor, Gfd1,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> a protein that may be involved in the terminal step of the export pathway involving disassembly of the export complex in the cytoplasm by the RNA helicase, Dbp5, and the export factor, Gle1.<xref rid="bib3 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,28</sup></xref> Gfd1 is a high-copy suppressor of the <italic>rat</italic>8-2 allele of <italic>DBP5</italic> and binds to both Gle1 and the cytoplasmically oriented nuclear pore protein, Nup42,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and, thus, has the potential to link Nab2 to both Gle1 and the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacts with the C-terminal domain of Mlp1. Our studies demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate interaction with Mlp1. We have determined the atomic resolution structure of the Nab2 N-terminal domain, using both NMR and X-ray crystallography, and show that it is analogous to the PWI fold found in several RNA-binding proteins. We have identified a putative protein:protein interaction site containing a hydrophobic surface patch centered on Phe73 that mutagenesis indicates is involved in the interaction between Nab2 and Mlp1 but not in the interaction with Gfd1.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <sec>
        <title>The Nab2 N-terminal domain binds to Mlp1</title>
        <p>Previous work<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> showed that full-length Nab2 binds to the C-terminal globular domain of Mlp1 (CT-Mlp1). We utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the domain of Nab2 that interacts with CT-Mlp1. Nab2 can be divided into four domains,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and hence, we constructed a series of two-hybrid bait plasmids expressing Nab2 in which each of the individual domains had been deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). We used a lacZ reporter that generates a blue color when an interaction occurs.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Each Nab2 plasmid was coexpressed with the vector alone (pJG4–5) or CT-Mlp1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, the negative vector controls (pEG202 and pJG4–5) were white, confirming that they did not activate the lacZ reporter. In contrast, coexpression of CT-Mlp1 and Nab2 generated the blue color, indicating that the lacZ reporter was activated, consistent with the proteins interacting with one another. CT-Mlp1 failed to interact with Nab2 only when the N-terminus was deleted (ΔN-Nab2), and the interaction was maintained with all other Nab2 fusion proteins. To determine if the N-terminal domain of Nab2 was sufficient for interaction with CT-Mlp1, we attempted to create a minimal yeast two-hybrid construct expressing only the N-terminal domain of Nab2. Unfortunately, this N-terminal domain fusion protein autoactivated the lacZ reporter; thus, we instead created a fusion consisting of both the N-terminal domain and the QQQP domain (Nab2-NQ). This protein interacted with CT-Mlp1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Gfd1 was used as a positive control for interaction with the N-terminal domain of Nab2,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and, as expected, Gfd1 interacted with the NQ domain but not with ΔN-Nab2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). For all two-hybrid experiments, expression of each fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Overall, the two-hybrid data suggest strongly that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 is both necessary and sufficient to interact with the Mlp1 C-terminal domain.</p>
        <p>Pull-down assays complemented the results obtained using the two-hybrid system and confirmed that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 without the QQQP domain is both necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions with Mlp1. A glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion to the N-terminal domain of Nab2 (GST-Nab2-N, residues 1–97 of Nab2) was engineered, expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and purified. Either GST-Nab2-N or GST alone as a control protein was incubated in yeast lysate, and then, the GST protein and any associated proteins were bound to glutathione beads. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, a band of approximately 220 kDa that copurified with GST-Nab2-N but not with GST alone was visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoblotting confirmed that this band corresponded to the full-length Mlp1 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c). When the yeast lysate was prepared from <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells, this 220-kDa band was not detected by either Coomassie staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) or immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c). Although the amount of Mlp1 copurified with GST-Nab2-N from yeast lysate was rather small, it is quite remarkable that a band corresponding to this full-length, very large, nuclear pore-associated protein<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> can be isolated from yeast extract in a single step. The results of this experiment indicate that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 is sufficient to copurify Mlp1 from a complex mixture, showing that the interaction is highly specific.</p>
        <p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay established that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacted directly with the Mlp1 C-terminus. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> as described in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>. Either GST-Nab2-N or GST control protein was incubated with the Mlp1 C-terminal domain fragment. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d, the Mlp1 fragment bound to GST-Nab2-N but not to the control GST protein, confirming that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacts directly with the C-terminal domain of Mlp1. The amount of binding between Nab2-N and CT-Mlp1 appears to be substoichiometric, which is consistent with the interaction between Nab2 and Mlp1 being relatively weak, to facilitate export rather than retention at the nuclear pore. Preliminary binding studies indicated that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for this interaction is in the micromolar range (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Structure of the Nab2 N-terminal domain</title>
        <p>The structure of the N-terminal domain of Nab2 was established using both NMR and X-ray crystallography. A fragment corresponding to residues 1–105 of Nab2 was produced in large quantities by bacterial expression and purified using conventional ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatographic methods (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). This material was exceptionally soluble, which facilitated the collection of NMR spectra, from which a model was generated using conventional methods. The final ensemble of 45 calculated structures of the Nab2 N-terminal domain is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a. Of the total of 50 structures calculated in the final round, these 45 correspond to a well-defined plateau region in the energy and energy-ordered root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a), indicating that they form a suitable set for reporting structural statistics (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Residues Met1–Gln3 and Gly100–Ala105 were unstructured in solution, as evidenced by the lack of any medium- or long-range nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) connectivities for these residues and by the sharpness and near random-coil chemical shift values of their NMR resonances. The remainder of the domain was well ordered, although there was slightly increased disorder in the loops, especially those between helix 1 and helix 2 (Pro22–Asp27) and, to a lesser extent, between helix 3 and helix 4 (Asp57–Ser60). The backbone rmsd over residues 4–99 was 0.47 ± 0.13 Å.</p>
        <p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of Nab2 was based on a bundle of five α-helices (H1–H5). Unlike the highly compact bundle formed by helices H1–H4, each of which made multiple contacts with at least two of the other helices, helix H5 was less tightly associated with the rest of the structure. The only NOE constraints from helix H5 to other parts of the structure were all contacts to helix H1 (Ala84 contacts Asn9, Val12, and Ile13; Ile87 contacts Ile13 and Glu16; Ile91 contacts Glu16 and Ala19; Asn95 contacts Ala19 and Gly20). These contacts were sufficient to constrain the position of helix H5 with comparable precision to those of the other helices, but they were much fewer in number than the constraints involving any of the other helices. Further evidence for the relatively loose attachment of helix H5 to the rest of the structure came from the observation that NMR samples were slowly proteolyzed from the C-terminus. Over a period of several weeks, many signals assigned to residues of helix H5 were progressively lost from the spectra, whereas the signals assigned to helices H1–H4 were largely unaffected. The signals for protons in helix H5 were generally weaker than other components of the structure and decreased with time, consistent with its being gradually proteolyzed.</p>
        <p>We also obtained <italic>P</italic>4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 symmetry crystals of the Nab2 N-terminal domain that diffracted past 1.8 Å resolution in-house (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We used the solution NMR structure of this domain as a model for molecular replacement and, after trying a number of different models containing different fragments of the structure, were able to obtain a unique solution using residues 7–82 (corresponding to helices H1–H4). After solvent flattening, the electron density enabled residues 6–94 to be built to produce a structural model that had an <italic>R</italic>-factor of 20.7% (<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> = 26.4%) and excellent geometry (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) after iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Comparison between solution and crystal structures</title>
        <p>The crystal and solution structures of the N-terminal domain of Nab2 were very similar for helices H1–H4 and superimposed with a C<sup>α</sup> rmsd of 1.2 Å. However, the position of helix H5 varied significantly between the two structures as a result of a rigid-body rotation of the order of 25° (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This difference in the position of helix H5 could have been the result of crystal packing or might have been a consequence of partial proteolysis as it was only possible to trace the chain in the crystal structure as far as residue 94, whereas in the solution structure, this helix extended to residue 99. However, these differences are also consistent with the helix being only loosely associated with the rest of the structure, which is also consistent with the relatively few NOE connectivities to helices H1–H4 in the NMR data. Moreover, when the TLS (translation/libration/screw) rigid-body motion<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> of the Nab2 N-terminal domain was modeled by assigning helices H1–H4 to one rigid body and helix H5 to another, the <italic>R</italic>-factor and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> derived from X-ray crystallography dropped substantially to 19.5% (from 20.7%) and 25.0% (from 26.4%), respectively. Analysis of the TLS motion using the TLDMD method<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> indicated that the libration motions of helix H5 (20.1°<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>) were substantially greater than those of the helix H1–H4 core (libration of 4.6°<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>), consistent with helix H5 being substantially more mobile. Potentially, the movement of helix H5 might have a regulatory role in modulating the interactions between the Nab2 N-terminal domain and other components of the mRNA export machinery.</p>

        <title>Similarity to the PWI fold</title>
        <p>A search for structural homologues of the Nab2 N-terminal domain using the DALI web site<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">†</xref> indicated that it had distant similarity to the PWI domain fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) that is found in a number of nucleic acid binding proteins such as the splicing factor and exon junction component SRm160.<xref rid="bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,34</sup></xref> The Pro-Trp-Ile sequence for which the PWI domain is named is found in helix H1 of this fold and is important in generating the hydrophobic core of the PWI fold in which the Trp and Ile side chains pack against Phe101 in helix H4 of SRm160. The PWI fold is thought to bind both single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA through a characteristic basic patch on its surface.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> However, there is little conservation at the sequence level, and the characteristic Pro-Trp-Ile (PWI) sequence motif is not present in the Nab2 N-terminal domain where the corresponding residues are Val12, Ile13, and Val14. Similarly, Nab2 lacks the characteristic positively charged surface patch that has been associated with nucleic acid binding.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Moreover, the nucleic acid binding function of SRm160 also requires residues upstream of the PWI domain<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> that are lacking in the Nab2 N-terminal domain, and, consistent with this observation, we were unable to detect any interaction between the Nab2 N-terminal domain and poly(N) RNA in band-shift assays under conditions where the PWI domain from SRm160 showed a clear interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Putative protein binding site centered on Phe73</title>
        <p>Inspection of the solution and crystal structures of the Nab2 N-terminal domain showed the presence of a hydrophobic patch centered on Phe72 and Phe73 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a), suggesting that this region of the surface might represent a putative protein:protein interaction interface. Phe73 in particular was completely exposed on the surface of the protein. We therefore engineered a series of amino acid changes in these positions and assayed these mutants for binding to Mlp1 and Gfd1. Mutation of Phe72 had a negligible effect on the binding of the Nab2 N-terminal domain to either the Mlp1 C-terminal fragment or the Gfd1 C-terminus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b–d). In contrast, mutation of Phe73 to Asp or Ala dramatically reduced the affinity of Nab2 for the Mlp1 C-terminal fragment, whereas mutation to Trp did not decrease its affinity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). Significantly, these mutations did not alter the binding of the Nab2 N-terminal domain to the Gfd1 C-terminal fragment, consistent with the mutations not altering the overall conformation of the domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c). Binding experiments using yeast lysates confirmed that mutations in the hydrophobic patch on Nab2 interfered with the interaction between Nab2-N and the intact full-length Mlp1 protein. Equal amounts of GST-Nab2-N variants (WT, F72D, and F73D) were incubated in yeast lysate prepared from cells expressing protein-A-tagged Mlp1, and then, proteins associated with GST-Nab2-N were recovered using glutathione beads. Mlp1 that copurified with GST-Nab2-N was detected by immunoblotting for the protein A tag. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>d, full-length Mlp1 copurified with both wild-type Nab2-N and F72D Nab2-N. However, copurification of Mlp1 was not detected with either the GST control or the Nab2-N F73D mutant. Overall, the mutagenesis results are consistent with Phe73 forming a crucial component of the interaction interface between Nab2 and Mlp1 and hydrophobic interactions making an important contribution to the interface.</p>
        <p>In summary, our results show that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 binds to the C-terminal domain of Mlp1 and that the Mlp1 binding site on Nab2 does not appear to overlap with the Gfd1 binding site. The Nab2 N-terminal domain has a fold based on a five-helix bundle that is analogous to the PWI fold found in SRm160 and other nucleic acid binding proteins, although it does not retain the nucleic acid binding function seen in other PWI domains. The hydrophobic side chain of Phe73 in the Nab2 N-terminal domain is exposed on the surface of the molecule and appears to be a crucial component of the Mlp1 binding site, although, clearly, further work will be required to define the precise nature of the interface between these two molecules. Our results are consistent with a model that envisages that interaction with Mlp proteins occurs soon before mRNA is exported and that Nab2 is important either for targeting the mRNA to the Mlp proteins or for releasing the mature mRNA from the Mlp proteins to enable its transit through the NPC. Such a model would be consistent with the increased nuclear retention of mRNA seen on overexpression of Mlp1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>

        <p>The N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacts with Mlp1. (a) A domain schematic of the Nab2 protein showing the Nab2 deletion mutants that were analyzed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The relative locations of the N-terminal (N), QQQP repeat, RGG, and tandem zinc finger (CCCH) domains are indicated. The size (in amino acids) is indicated for the full-length protein, and the residues deleted from each variant are indicated. The yeast two-hybrid reporter strain (EGY48) was transformed with the indicated DBD plasmids expressing each Nab2 variant, in combination with an AD control plasmid (−), an AD plasmid expressing CT-Mlp1 (residues 1490–1875), or, as a control, an AD expressing Gfd1. Positive interactions are indicated by the blue color that arises from activation of the β-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter. (b) The N-terminal domain of Nab2 (Nab2-N) binds Mlp1 from yeast lysates. Purified recombinant GST-Nab2-N or GST alone as a control protein was incubated in yeast cell lysate prepared from either wild-type (WT) or <italic>MLP1</italic> deletion (<italic>mlp1</italic>Δ) cells. The GST proteins were purified on glutathione beads, and copurifying proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. A band corresponding to Mlp1 copurified with GST-N from wild-type but not <italic>mlp1</italic>Δ cells. (c) GST-Nab2-N or GST alone as a control protein was incubated in yeast lysate from cells expressing TAP-tagged Mlp1. GST fusion proteins were purified, and unbound (U) and bound (B) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with PAP antibody to detect TAP-tagged Mlp1. (d) Purified recombinant GST-Nab2-N or GST control protein was incubated with Mlp1 C-terminal domain and binding was assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.</p>

        <p>Solution structure of the Nab2 N-terminal domain. (a) Ensemble view of the 45 accepted structures, showing all heavy atoms (superposed using the N, C<sup>α</sup>, and C′ atoms of residues 4–99). The backbone and the majority of side chains are determined to high precision, with significant disorder being limited to the chain termini, a few surface side chains, and the loops between helices 1 and 2 and between helices 4 and 5. Structural statistics appear in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. (b) A schematic illustration of the secondary structure of the N-terminal domain of Nab2. The fold of this domain is based on five α-helices (H1, red; H2, yellow; H3, green; H4, blue; and H5, purple) that pack to form a compact bundle. The arrangement of helices H1–H4 is analogous to that of the PWI fold<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <p>Crystal structure of the Nab2 N-terminal domain and comparison with the solution structure. Helices H1–H4 of the solution (cyan) and crystal (yellow) structures of the N-terminal domain of Nab2 superimposed well, but the position of helix H5 changed substantially between the two. In the solution structure, this helix appeared to be less intimately associated with the rest of the domain. The change in the position of helix H5 may be due to the removal of residues 95–99 from this helix in the crystal structure or might be the result of crystal packing.</p>

        <p>The N-terminal domain of Nab2 does not bind to RNA. Binding to radioactively labeled randomized sequence 25-nt poly(N) RNA probe was assessed by a gel shift assay. Purified recombinant GST-Nab2-N, negative control, GST alone, or positive control, GST-SRm160-N, was incubated with radioactively labeled RNA probe. Complexes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis. Results are shown for probe alone (−), GST alone, or increasing concentrations (0.5–5 μM) of GST-Nab2-N or GST-SRm160-N.

        <p>A hydrophobic pocket on Nab2 is required for the interaction with Mlp1 but not with Gfd1. (a) Illustration of the hydrophobic putative protein interaction site (red) on the surface of the Nab2 N-terminal domain centered on Phe73 identified by the PPI-Pred site [<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/ppi-pred/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/ppi-pred/</ext-link>]. The aromatic ring of Phe73 projects away from the protein surface and, hence, is an attractive candidate for a component of an interaction surface. (b) Wild-type (WT) or mutant (F72D, F73D, F73W, and F73A) GST-Nab2-N proteins were incubated with purified recombinant Mlp1 C-terminal domain. GST alone serves as a specificity control. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione beads and then eluted with sample buffer. Bound proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. (c) Wild-type (WT) or mutant (F72D and F73D) purified recombinant His-tagged Nab2-N was incubated with either Gfd1 beads (right) or control ovalbumin beads. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with sample buffer, and the bound proteins were resolved by PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Note that Gfd1 and the control protein, ovalbumin, are covalently attached to beads; hence, they are not present in the bound fraction eluted with sample buffer. (d) Wild-type or mutant (F72D and F73D) GST-Nab2-N was incubated in yeast lysate prepared from cells expressing Mlp1-TAP. As a control, GST alone was also analyzed. Proteins that copurified with the GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with PAP antibody, which detects the TAP-tagged Mlp1 protein.</p>
