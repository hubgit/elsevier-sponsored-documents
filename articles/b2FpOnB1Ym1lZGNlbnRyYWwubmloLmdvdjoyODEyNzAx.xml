        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>RelB, the ribbon–helix–helix (RHH) repressor encoded by the <italic>relBE</italic> toxin–antitoxin locus of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, interacts with RelE and thereby counteracts the mRNA cleavage activity of RelE. In addition, RelB dimers repress the strong <italic>relBE</italic> promoter and this repression by RelB is enhanced by RelE; that is, RelE functions as a transcriptional co-repressor. RelB is a Lon protease substrate, and Lon is required both for activation of <italic>relBE</italic> transcription and for activation of the mRNA cleavage activity of RelE. Here we characterize the molecular interactions important for transcriptional control of the <italic>relBE</italic> model operon. Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> screen for <italic>relB</italic> mutants, we identified multiple nucleotide changes that map to important amino acid positions within the DNA-binding domain formed by the N-terminal RHH motif of RelB. Analysis of DNA binding of a subset of these mutant RHH proteins by gel-shift assays, transcriptional fusion assays and a structure model of RelB–DNA revealed amino acid residues making crucial DNA–backbone contacts within the operator (<italic>relO</italic>) DNA. Mutational and footprinting analyses of <italic>relO</italic> showed that RelB dimers bind on the same face of the DNA helix and that the RHH motif recognizes four 6-bp repeats within the bipartite binding site. The spacing between each half-site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions between adjacently bound RelB dimers stabilized by the co-repressor RelE. Kinetic and stoichiometric measurements of the interaction between RelB and RelE confirmed that the proteins form a high-affinity complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Lon degraded RelB <italic>in vitro</italic> and degradation was inhibited by RelE, consistent with the proposal that RelE protects RelB from proteolysis by Lon <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Toxin–antitoxin (TA) loci are abundant gene cassettes present, often in multiple copies, on plasmids and chromosomes of Bacteria and Archaea.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> TA loci encode a stable “toxin” that inhibits translation or replication and an unstable antitoxin that neutralizes the toxin. Ectopic production of the toxins is highly inhibitory to cell growth, but the antitoxins form complexes with the toxins and thereby counterbalance toxin activity. Activation of TA loci depends on cellular proteases such as Lon or Clp that degrade the antitoxins.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Two major classes of toxins have been identified based on their cellular targets. One class of toxins inhibits translation by mRNA cleavage (i.e., RelE and MazF) and is commonly referred to as mRNA interferases.<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4–8</sup></xref> Another class of toxins inhibits DNA gyrase and thereby inhibits replication (i.e., CcdB and ParE).<xref rid="bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9–11</sup></xref> The antitoxins are small modular proteins that contain an N-terminal structured DNA-binding domain, required for autoregulation of TA operon transcription, and a flexible C-terminus, required for antitoxin activity.<xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12–15</sup></xref> Upon interaction with the cognate toxin, the C-terminus of the antitoxin becomes structured and results in the formation of a tight nontoxic protein complex.<xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16–18</sup></xref> In almost all cases known, the TA complex binds to one or more operators in the TA promoter region and represses transcription of the TA operon.<xref rid="bib19 bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19–21</sup></xref> In its free state, the antitoxin is degraded by one or more cellular proteases.<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3,22–26</sup></xref> Thus, the cellular levels and turnover rates of the proteins are adjusted by a combination of autoregulation and proteolysis. Usually, the TA genes are translationally coupled and produce antitoxin in excess of the toxin, ensuring efficient inactivation of the latter,<xref rid="bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27, 28, 29</sup></xref> although exceptions to this paradigm probably exist.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The <italic>relBE</italic> locus of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> encodes mRNA interferase RelE that cleaves mRNA positioned at the ribosomal A-site and antitoxin RelB that counteracts this activity.<xref rid="bib5 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,30</sup></xref> RelB copurifies with RelE and the proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid system.<xref rid="bib31 bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,32</sup></xref> The <italic>relBE</italic> operon is autoregulated by RelB, which alone functions as a repressor of transcription. The RelBE complex represses transcription more efficiently than RelB alone; thus, RelE functions as a co-repressor of transcription.<xref rid="bib19 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,33,34</sup></xref> During steady-state cell growth, <italic>relBE</italic> transcription is efficiently repressed due to autoregulation by the RelBE complex.<xref rid="bib2 bib19 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,19,33</sup></xref> By contrast, conditions that inhibit translation, such as amino acid starvation, induce <italic>relBE</italic> transcription and concomitantly activate RelE.<xref rid="bib2 bib19 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,19,35,36</sup></xref> The metabolic turnover of RelB depends on Lon protease and degradation of RelB was suggested to explain the strongly increased <italic>relBE</italic> transcription during amino acid starvation.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Recently, we showed that RelB and RelE form a tight RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex that bound cooperatively to the <italic>relO</italic> operator in the <italic>relBE</italic> promoter region.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Interestingly, <italic>relBE</italic> transcription was controlled by the RelB/RelE ratio rather than the absolute amounts of the proteins. Thus, with excess RelB, RelE strongly enhanced binding of RelB to the operator and repressed transcription. By contrast, excess RelE prevented RelB binding to <italic>relO in vitro</italic> and stimulated <italic>relBE</italic> operon transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, excess RelE triggered <italic>relBE</italic> transcription.</p>
      <p>The solution structure of a RelB dimer was obtained recently.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Consistent with our findings,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> this study showed that a RelB dimer recognizes a hexad repeat in the palindromic operator through an N-terminal ribbon–helix–helix (RHH) motif and that RelE enhances the affinity of adjacent bound RelB dimers for the operator element. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the flexible C-terminus of RelB is required for RelB dimers to dimerize.</p>
      <p>To gain further insight into the molecular interactions controlling the <italic>relBE</italic> transcription and RelE activity, we have undertaken a genetic and biochemical study of the regulatory properties of RelB. Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> screen for <italic>relB</italic> mutants defective in autoregulation, we identify amino acid residues within the RHH motif of RelB important for DNA binding. By mutational analysis of <italic>relO</italic> and hydroxyl radical footprinting, we show that RelB occupies four hexad repeats within <italic>relO</italic> with the core sequence [A/T]TGT[A/C]A. By nucleotide insertions, we show that no spacing is allowed between each of the two <italic>relO</italic> half-sites in order for the repression complex to maintain autoregulation. The appearance of free RelE is prevented by tight subnanomolar interaction to RelB and an ∼ 10-fold lower <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration to that of its cognate antitoxin. The ATP-dependent Lon protease binds to RelB and stimulates its degradation. Together, these results provide a quantitative and mechanistic basis for how the activity of the model RelE mRNA interferase is controlled.</p>

        <title>Random mutagenesis of <italic>relB</italic></title>
        <p>To identify amino acid residues in RelB important for autoregulation of the <italic>relBE</italic> operon, we constructed an <italic>in vivo</italic> screen based on a plasmid (pMO2541) in which the <italic>relBE</italic><sup><italic>R81A</italic></sup> operon was fused in-frame to <italic>lacZ</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a); <italic>relE</italic><sup><italic>R81A</italic></sup> encodes a nontoxic version of RelE.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> In keeping with our previous finding that RelB autoregulates <italic>relBE</italic> transcription,<xref rid="bib19 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,33</sup></xref> this plasmid (pMO2541) expressed a very low level of LacZ activity in a Δ<italic>relBE</italic> deletion strain (&lt; 1 U, data not shown). Since RelE is required for efficient autorepression, this low level of LacZ activity indicated that the LacZ portion of the RelE::LacZ fusion protein did not interfere with the co-repressor function of RelE.</p>
        <p>Using silent mutations, we engineered two restriction sites into either end of <italic>relB</italic>, thus being able to insert <italic>relB</italic>-encoding DNA fragments that had been mutagenized by PCR into the natural context of <italic>relB</italic> (codons 4–76). Next, we screened for mutant alleles yielding dark blue colonies on X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-galactoside) indicator plates. As expected, most such mutations were located in the RHH motif of RelB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, vertical arrows). Some mutations (base transversions or transitions) were found together with one of the other mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, residues colored black), while most mutant alleles (residues colored red) only contained single base mutations. We did not observe any mutations leading to substitutions in the conserved signature residue R7 of RelB; however, mutations were found encoding residues specific for the RelB family (I8, D9 and K13) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) and also in the conserved residues S28, R32 and L33. Interestingly, we also obtained the <italic>relB101</italic> allele A39D that leads to “hyperactivation” of RelE due to metabolic instability of RelB<sup>A39D</sup> (Ref. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The <italic>relB101</italic> mutation was originally found in a genetic screen that identified mutations that rendered the cell unable to inhibit synthesis of stable RNA during amino acid starvation,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> the so-called delayed relaxed response.</p>
        <p>To map our mutations on the RelB structure, we constructed a model of (RelB<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>–DNA based on the previous published NMR structure of the RelB N-terminal domain,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> the Arc–DNA crystal structure,<xref rid="bib39 bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39,40,41</sup></xref> and our previous published stoichiometric data<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and d). In the model, two important sets of protein–DNA contacts are observed: β-sheets that insert into the DNA major grooves making crucial sequence-specific nucleotide base contacts (S3, D5 and R7) and protein–DNA backbone contacts involving amino acids in the N-terminus of the second α-helix α2 (S28). We obtained mutations in S28 (S28F and S28H) that abolished autoregulation, which could indicate that protein backbone amide groups in combination with side-chain specific hydrogen bonds make crucial contacts with the DNA phosphate groups on either side of the major grooves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and d). In addition, we obtained K13E substitutions. Lysine 13 is a surface-exposed basic residue that potentially can form additional nonspecific contact through electrostatic interaction to the DNA backbone phosphate on both sides of the DNA helix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). This interaction might, in combination with the contacts made by S28, guide or anchor the RelB dimers for correct positioning and sequence-specific nucleotide base contacts between the antiparallel β-sheets of RelB and the DNA major grooves in the operator region. Yet other mutations in <italic>relB</italic> yielded amino acid changes in key residues of the hydrophobic core in the RHH domain that probably do not contribute directly to protein–DNA contacts (i.e., I8, L33 and I38). Another substitution, which maps to the α1–α2 loop (V25G), could potentially affect DNA binding by changing the relative position of α1 to α2 crucial for anchoring DNA backbone contacts by the N- terminus of helix α2.</p>

        <title>DNA-binding properties of RelB with amino acid changes in the RHH motif</title>
        <p>The above-described amino acid changes in RelB in all cases abolished autoregulation of the <italic>relBE</italic> operon. To gain direct evidence for defects in <italic>relO</italic> operator binding, we analyzed the autoregulatory and DNA-binding properties of RelB RHH variants R7A, I8A, K13A and S28L/R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, asterisks). In the first three RelB variants, we introduced a single alanine substitution such that the properties of specific residues could be compared. For S28 we chose to create two substitutions (S28L, S28R). In the dimeric Arc repressor, homologous replacements (S35L, S35R) disrupt cooperative DNA binding<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> (see the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>). The transcriptional activity of the <italic>relBE</italic> promoter was measured using a series of <italic>relBE<sup>R81A</sup>-lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion constructs based in an R1 low-copy-number transcriptional fusion plasmid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). As in the genetic screening, the RelB RHH variants were coexpressed with nontoxic RelE<sup>R81A</sup> encoded in cis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). While wild-type (WT) RelB efficiently repressed the promoter to below 10 U, the RHH mutations R7A, S28L and S28R all resulted in more than 100-fold derepression. The I8A and K13A mutants resulted in 43- and 83-fold derepression, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a).</p>
        <p>Next, we measured DNA binding of the RelB RHH variants in complex with the co-repressor His<sub>6</sub>-RelE (RelE) in a gel-shift assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). The antitoxin variants copurified with RelE and behaved similar to WT RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE with respect to tight interaction with the toxin (see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In the gel-shift assay, a ternary complex of RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE·<italic>relO</italic><sub>166</sub> formed at the lowest concentration (0.05 μM) of protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). No ternary complexes were observed for the RHH variants R7A, K13A and S28L, not even at the highest concentration of the protein complex (1.25 μM). Replacing I8 with an alanine lowered the affinity of the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex by ∼ 10- to 20-fold. For the S28R variant, a faint ternary complex was only visible at the highest concentration used (1.25 μM). The oligomeric states of WT RelB and the mutated variants were further compared using chemical cross-linking with BS<sup>3</sup> [bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate] (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). All RHH mutant proteins exhibited oligomerization patterns similar to that of WT RelB. The most predominant bands corresponded to dimers and tetramers. At lower RelB concentrations, only the dimeric band was observed (data not shown). Interestingly, in the homologous dimeric Arc repressor, S35 (S28 in RelB) is located in the dimer–dimer interface and replacement to residues with larger side chains (e.g., arginine or leucine) disrupts cooperative binding.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> In summary, our DNA-binding assays, structural model and cross-linking data indicated that S28 is involved in DNA–backbone interactions and is not required for tetramerization of RelB.</p>

        <title>Scanning mutagenesis of <italic>relO</italic></title>
        <p>Previously, RelB<sub>2</sub> and the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex were found to protect a region within P<sub><italic>relBE</italic></sub> termed <italic>relO</italic> spanning the region − 10 to + 17 with respect to the transcription start site.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> We confirmed that the left and right boundaries of the operator were located around − 10 and + 20 by 5′ and 3′ promoter–operator DNA deletion analysis using gel-shift assays (Fig. S2a and b).</p>
        <p>To further define the sequence specificity required for high-affinity binding of RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE to <italic>relO</italic>, we systematically introduced dinucleotide transversion substitutions in the promoter–operator region from − 10 to + 16 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>relO1</italic> through <italic>relO14</italic>). These mutations were introduced into R1 <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion vectors containing either the entire <italic>relBE</italic><sup><italic>R81A</italic></sup> operon (pMGJ4004, repressed promoter) or only the <italic>relB</italic> promoter as a control for promoter activity (pKG4001, unrepressed promoter). Thus, the control plasmid was used to assess the effect of the mutations on the activity of the unrepressed <italic>relBE</italic> promoter (data not shown). The transcriptional activity of each promoter construct was measured during exponential cell growth. Mutations between positions − 10 and − 7 (TA and CT introduced into the − 10 box) abolished P<sub><italic>relBE</italic></sub> promoter activity of the control plasmid and excluded them from the analysis. For the remaining constructs, the transcriptional activities of the repressed promoters (due to the presence of <italic>relBE</italic><sup>R81A</sup>) were normalized with the activity of the unrepressed promoter (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Full repression of P<sub><italic>relBE</italic></sub> was defined as the LacZ activity expressed from a plasmid (pMGJ4001) carrying the WT operator, <italic>relO</italic> (5.2 ± 2.4 U). Mutations on both sides of the pseudo palindromic half-site (<underline>TTGTAAT</underline>G<underline>ACA</underline>T) TG→GT, TA→GC (<italic>relO1</italic> and <italic>relO2</italic>) and GA→TC, CA→AC (mutants <italic>relO4</italic> and <italic>relO5</italic> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) resulted in significant derepression (12- and 36-fold, respectively), whereas the central AT (<italic>relO3</italic>) appeared less critical for repression. A similar pattern was observed for the perfect palindromic right half-site <underline>TTGTAATTACAA</underline>, with the exception of the first TG dinucleotide (<italic>relO7</italic>), which appeared to be more important than any other dinucleotide pair. Interestingly, substitution of the central TT pair resulted in a 190-fold derepression of transcription that may reflect the loss of RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE binding to both half-sites of <italic>relO</italic> (<italic>relO6</italic>). To determine the contribution of each of the central T's, we extended the analysis and introduced single base transversions (<italic>relO13</italic> and <italic>relO14</italic>). In these cases, the promoter was derepressed 5- and 4-fold, respectively, indicating that the boundary between the two half-sites plays a pivotal role in maintaining cooperativity between adjacent bound RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complexes, possibly involving DNA bending similar as shown for the Arc repressor–DNA complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and d).</p>
        <p>The above-described and previous findings showed that both half-sites of <italic>relO</italic> were required for cooperative binding of the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complexes.<xref rid="bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33,34</sup></xref> Therefore, we introduced spacing between the two half-sites. Addition of only two nucleotides (<italic>relO15</italic>) that brought the two half-sites out of phase resulted in 45-fold derepression of <italic>relBE</italic> transcription. Insertion of eight additional T nucleotides (<italic>relO16</italic>) brought the half-sites back into phase; however, it failed to restore repression (50-fold derepression). Thus, the architecture of the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex bound to operator DNA requires both half-sites in close proximity. The mutational analysis of <italic>relO</italic> defined a hexad binding motif [A/T]TGT[A/C]A, repeated twice on each strand (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom), with the less critical nucleotide being the terminal A nucleotide of each subsite.</p>

        <title>RelB occupies four distinct subsites in <italic>relO</italic></title>
        <p>Next, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting on both DNA strands of <italic>relO</italic> using increasing concentrations of RelB and RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Two discrete but distinct regions of protection (marked with filled bars) were observed for the two highest concentrations of RelB and for all three concentrations of the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex, confirming that RelB interacts directly with <italic>relO</italic> and that RelE acts to increase its affinity. This pattern was evident for both strands (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, left and right). However, closer examination of these regions on both strands revealed that DNA backbone protection occurs at two base positions, T and G in one of the protected regions and at three base positions T, T and G in the other region. The strongest protection occurred at the backbone of the guanine base. These distinct sites confirmed the subtle asymmetry of the two half-sites and further define a <italic>relO</italic> core sequence of [a/t]TGt[a/c]a (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). More importantly, the protected regions on each strand were interrupted by 9 and 10 bp, respectively, without any protection. This observation indicated that <italic>relO</italic> was occupied by two RelB dimers on the same face of the DNA, thus supporting the model shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and d.</p>

        <title>RelB forms a tight 2:1 heterotrimeric complex with RelE</title>
        <p>RelE increased both the affinity (&gt; 10-fold) and the cooperativity of RelB dimers for <italic>relO</italic>.<xref rid="bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33,34</sup></xref> Using quantitative immunoblotting, we estimated that there are 550 to 1100 RelB and 50 to 100 RelE molecules in rapidly growing cells of MG1655 carrying WT <italic>relBE</italic> at its native chromosomal locus (Fig. S3). These measurements were difficult to accomplish due to the low cellular amounts of the proteins, and, to our knowledge, this is the first estimate of the levels of a toxin–antitoxin pair expressed in its native context. RelB was in ≈ 10-fold excess of RelE. This relatively modest excess of RelB can keep RelE inactivated only if RelB binds very tightly to RelE. To address this question quantitatively, we measured the affinity of the RelB–RelE interaction by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. To this end, we immobilized RelB-Cys on an SPR sensor chip (the extra cysteine in RelB did not change the interaction with RelE; see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). To determine the kinetics of the interaction, RelE was injected over the chip surface containing immobilized RelB-Cys. The result of repeated cycles of association, dissociation and regeneration using increasing concentrations is shown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). The binding response data were fitted to an equation (Langmuir, <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) to obtain estimates for the rate constants <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (5.01 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>− 1</sup> s<sup>− 1</sup>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (1.66 × 10<sup>− </sup><sup>4</sup> s<sup>− 1</sup>). The apparent dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub><italic>/k</italic><sub>on</sub>) of 0.33 nM was similar to the strong binding affinities reported for other TA systems.<xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42,43</sup></xref> As described in the Supplemental Material, these data allowed us to estimate that, on average, there is less than one free RelE molecule per cell in rapidly growing cells.</p>
        <p>Recently, we reported that RelB and RelE form a RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> whereas data obtained elsewhere favored a RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE<sub>2</sub> complex.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> To obtain more information on the stoichiometry of the RelB·RelE complex in solution, we measured tryptophan fluorescence of RelE (RelB does not contain tryptophan) upon titration with RelB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b). As shown, the increase in fluorescence upon complex formation leveled off at a RelB/RelE ratio of ∼ 2. This result supports the formation of a (RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> complex. To obtain more independent estimates of the stoichiometry, we also performed amino acid analysis of purified RelB·RelE complex (Table S2), which was preformed <italic>in vivo</italic> (Supplemental Material).

        <title>RelB displays functional interaction with Lon</title>
        <p>The ATP-dependent protease Lon degrades RelB <italic>in vivo</italic>.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> To analyze the RelB–Lon interaction, we performed SPR analysis of the purified proteins. Injection of Lon-His<sub>6</sub> (Lon) over a chip surface containing immobilized RelB-Cys resulted in a binding response with a slow dissociation phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). This interaction was further stimulated by including the Lon cofactors, ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, in the buffer. Interestingly, removal of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulted in fast dissociation of additional bound Lon back to the level obtained without the addition of cofactors. A weak stimulatory effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone was detected (data not shown). This indicates that most of the effect observed when including ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the buffer can be ascribed to ATP.</p>
        <p>To determine the kinetic constants of the interaction, increasing concentrations of Lon were injected over the sensor chip surface containing immobilized RelB-Cys (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). The rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> was quite low (2.34 × 10<sup>− </sup><sup>4</sup> s<sup>− 1</sup>) but we failed to obtain a reliable fit for the association rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>. Nevertheless, we estimate the apparent dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> to be less than 2 nM.</p>
        <p>Finally, we investigated the functionality of the interaction between Lon and RelB using an <italic>in vitro</italic> degradation assay. Here we used a RelB variant containing an N-terminal tag for heart myosin kinase (HMK-RelB) to allow <sup>32</sup>P labeling of the protein for detection of full-length RelB as well as possible degradation products in a quantitative manner. Incubation of Lon with HMK-RelB resulted in degradation of HMK-RelB in an ATP- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c, lanes 1–4). Prior formation of a complex between HMK-RelB and RelE reduced the degradation rate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c, lane 5). The <italic>in vitro</italic> half-life of HMK-RelB was long (&gt; 60 min) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c, lanes 7–12). Since the degradation rate slowed significantly after 60 min, this could reflect either depletion of ATP or inactivation of Lon. We did not obtain any effects of including an ATP regeneration system or by using native RelB (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>RelB is the crucial regulator of the model <italic>relBE</italic> locus. Therefore, we investigated in detail the molecular interactions of the RelB antitoxin with respect to (i) the <italic>relO</italic> operator DNA, (ii) interaction with RelE and (iii) interaction with the ATP-dependent protease Lon.</p>
      <p>To delineate the RelB DNA binding and/or co-repressor interaction space, we used mutagenic PCR to obtain <italic>relB</italic> mutants that, when cloned in our <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), conferred derepression of the <italic>relBE</italic> promoter. The amino acid changes in RelB mapped to distinct and important domains within the N-terminal DNA-binding RHH motif.<xref rid="bib34 bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,44</sup></xref> At the β-stranded N-terminus forming an antiparallel β-sheet with a second RelB monomer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and d), we obtained a mutation of isoleucine I8 into a threonine. Together with the conserved hydrophobic amino acids I4 and L6, this residue constitutes an important element of the hydrophobic core of the RHH domain. In chemical cross-linking assays, the RelB<sup>I8A</sup> mutant formed dimeric and tetrameric species, similar to WT RelB (Fig. S1). By inference, I8 probably plays a more direct role in DNA interaction, since its multimerization properties appeared similar to those of WT RelB. Consistently, NMR titration studies of RelB revealed major chemical shift perturbations of I8 upon binding to operator DNA.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, the β-strand residues N5 and R7 that are engaged in nucleotide base specific contacts<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> were not obtained in the screen. We therefore constructed the RelB<sup>R7A</sup> variant and thereby confirmed the importance of this basic residue in our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> operator-binding assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The DNA binding surface of RelB displays an overall positive electrostatic potential, which is primarily maintained by residues R7 and K13. Several mutants obtained in our screen resulted in the RelB<sup>K13E</sup> variant, indicating the importance of the charge contribution from this residue. According to the RelB–DNA model, K13 side chains are in close proximity to the DNA phosphate backbone on either side of DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d), implying potential electrostatic backbone contacts. In addition, K13 displays major chemical shift perturbations upon binding to operator DNA.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In RHH proteins, β-sheet binding to DNA major groove by nucleotide base specific contacts are assisted by further nonspecific contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> These contacts are made specifically by protein-backbone amide nitrogen atoms at the N-terminus of helix α2. We also obtained mutations in S28 of RelB (S28F/H) in our screen and S28L/R changes introduced by site-directed mutagenesis affected operator binding and <italic>relBE</italic> autoregulation, as expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the crystal structure of CopG bound to DNA, hydrogen bonds between side chains of S29 at the N-terminus of helix α2 and phosphate groups of DNA further sustain this backbone interaction<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> and thus provide a possible explanation for the conservation of serine or threonine residues at this position. Finally, the S28L/R RelB mutants formed dimeric and tetrameric species in chemical cross-linking assays (Fig. S1). This indicates that unlike similar amino acid changes in the dimer–dimer interface of Arc repressor (S35L/R) defective in cooperative operator binding, RelB tetramerization includes additional contacts, which potentially could involve the flexible C-terminus.<xref rid="bib34 bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,41</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In the loop region between helices α1 and α2, the conserved G-X-S/T/N motif is critical for the correct positioning of the N-terminus of helix α2 to make anchoring contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Consistently, a V25G mutation led to promoter derepression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) and a site-directed G24P mutation resulted in a hyperlabile RelB mutant defective in autoregulation and operator binding (data not shown). Taken together, our genetic approach was very useful in the construction of RelB mutants, since we picked up amino acid changes in most of the signature residues within the RHH DNA-binding domain.</p>
      <p>Recently, we showed that RelB in complex with RelE binds cooperatively to separate half-sites in <italic>relO</italic>, suggesting that two RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE heterotrimers occupy both sites simultaneously.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Interaction occurred exclusively via RelB, as RelE alone or in complex with RelB did not alter the DNase I protection pattern. Here we performed a mutational analysis of the <italic>relO</italic> operator to determine nucleotide bases within the operator half-sites critical for specific binding of RelB dimers. We found, with a resolution of two nucleotides, that the central four nucleotides within the hexad core sequence [A/T]TGT[A/C]A are highly critical for autorepression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, we found that no spacing could be accommodated between the two 12-bp pseudo palindromic and perfect palindromic half-sites, which is in accordance with a cooperative binding mode. Consistently, RelB and the RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex confer hydroxyl radical backbone protection at TG and TTG sequences in the left and right half-sites, respectively (<xref rid="fig3 fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 3 and 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that free RelE inhibits protein synthesis by inducing cleavage of mRNAs positioned in the ribosomal A-site.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This activity of RelE is counteracted by direct protein–protein interaction to antitoxin RelB.<xref rid="bib5 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,31</sup></xref> The interaction between RelB and RelE depends on the flexible and proteolytically cleavable C-terminus of RelB.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> We obtained estimates of the kinetic rate constants of the RelB–RelE interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), which confirmed that RelB and RelE form a highly stable complex with an <italic>in vitro</italic> half-life of approximately 70 min. Based on our estimates of the total cellular amounts of RelB and RelE (Fig. S3) and our SPR interaction data, we estimated that the cellular level of free RelE is probably lower than one molecule per cell. This low level must be due to both the negative transcriptional control loop and the tight complex formation between RelB and RelE. Since overexpression of RelE very efficiently inhibits translation,<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> the level of free RelE must be very low in rapidly growing cells and our estimate is thus consistent with this inference.</p>
      <p>In agreement with previously published results,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> our data obtained here favor a stoichiometry of 2:1 for the RelB–RelE complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b and Table S2). In two separate studies, analytical gel-filtration analysis determined the mass of the RelB·RelE complex to be 47 and 49 kDa, respectively.<xref rid="bib34 bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34,46</sup></xref> This is close to the calculated mass of a (RelB·RelE)<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer. Indeed, a heterotetramer was obtained in the crystal structure of an archaeal RelB·RelE complex.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In support of a 2:1 stoichiometry, we have analytical gel-filtration data that show that free RelE is a monomer (data not shown), and from chemical cross-linking we have evidence that RelB forms dimers and tetramers in solution (Fig. S1). This is in agreement with additional analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. S4). Thus, our data favor a RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complex as the major species in solution. However, TA stoichiometries are highly dynamic and interconversion between heterotrimer and heterotetramer species allows for increased capacity of the antitoxin to neutralize its cognate toxin and also provides a mechanism for TA ratio-dependent derepression of their cognate promoters.<xref rid="bib33 bib47 bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33,47,48</sup></xref> We suggested previously that RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE is the primary repressor complex that binds at <italic>relO</italic> and that excess RelE leads to the formation of a RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE<sub>2</sub> complex that does not bind to <italic>relO</italic>, thereby explaining mechanistically how excess of RelE derepresses <italic>relBE</italic> transcription.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Activation of RelE is achieved through ATP-dependent RelB degradation by the Lon protease.<xref rid="bib2 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,23</sup></xref> Here we provide direct evidence for a strong interaction between Lon and RelB <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). Moreover, we found that the interaction was enhanced by ATP and to a lesser degree by magnesium. The nature of this interaction is not known; however, overexpression of a proteolytically inactive Lon mutant sequesters efficiently Lon substrates and thereby complements the mutant phenotypes of a <italic>lon</italic> mutant.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Thus, initial substrate binding is important for Lon function and is in good agreement with the stable complexes we obtained using SPR analysis. We also confirmed that Lon degrades RelB <italic>in vitro</italic> in a magnesium- and ATP-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). This degradation is likely to be initiated at the proteolytically unstable C-terminus of RelB that is protected by RelE.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Prior formation of RelB<sub>2</sub>·RelE complexes by addition of a molar excess of RelE reduced degradation, consistent with the proposal that RelE interacts with the C-terminus of RelB and thereby protects RelB from degradation by Lon.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have characterized multiple important molecular interactions within the RelBE system in <italic>E. coli</italic>: interaction of RelB with RelE, preventing its mRNA interferase activity and essential for efficient autoregulation; interaction of RelB with Lon, regulating its metabolic turnover and activation of RelE; interaction of RelB with <italic>relO</italic> DNA, required for autoregulation of the <italic>relBE</italic> operon. Combined, these interactions keep the system in the OFF-state during steady-state growth along with a derepressor mechanism and translational coupling ensuring RelB is kept in excess to RelE (Christensen and Gerdes, unpublished data). Upon nutritional stress, such as amino acid starvation, <italic>relBE</italic> is activated and reduces the global rate of translation.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Shortly after onset of starvation, the RelB/RelE ratio is reduced. This change leads to release of the RelB<sub>2</sub>–RelE complex and derepression of the strong <italic>relBE</italic> promoter. Unfortunately, we do not have direct evidence for the notion that this trigger mechanism is important for the biological function of <italic>relBE</italic>. However, the trigger mechanism is conserved in nonhomologous TA loci,<xref rid="bib15 bib47 bib50 bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,47,50,51,52</sup></xref> arguing that indeed it is important. One function may be to promote rapid induction of <italic>relBE</italic> transcription at the onset of nutritional stress such as amino acid starvation. The regulatory interactions with the RelBE system are summarized in the model shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and further explained in the figure legend.</p>
      <p>The biological function of chromosomal TA loci is currently a matter of debate. However, accumulating evidence suggests that at least some of them function to adjust the global rates of translation and replication to a given supply of nutrients from the environment.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Accordingly, in support of the stress response hypothesis, transcription of a number of TA loci was induced by heat shock in <italic>Sulfolobus sulfataricus</italic><xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> and by exposure to chloroform in <italic>Nitrosomonas europaea</italic>.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref></p>

The latter step was repeated twice, once with 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and once in 96% ethanol. Then 100 μl of piperidine (1 M) was added to the DNA pellet and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. The DNA solution was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried in a speed-vac overnight. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of water and dried in a speed-vac twice and resuspended in 80% formamide loading buffer. Sequencing reactions were separated alongside the corresponding hydroxyl radical reactions as described above.</p>

        <title>Surface plasmon resonance analysis</title>
        <p>SPR analyses of RelB–RelE and RelB–Lon interactions were carried out on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB) equipped with a CM5 sensor chip. In short, Approximately 40 RU RelB-Cys was immobilized with ligand thiol coupling [4 min NHS/EDC, 4 min PDEA, short pulses of RelB-Cys in 10 mM NaAc (pH 3.5), reduced and desalted on Poros R1, 4 min cysteine]. His<sub>6</sub>-RelE or Lon-His<sub>6</sub> at concentrations (monomeric) indicated in the figure was injected over immobilized RelB-Cys in series with a nonderivatized reference control flow cell at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. After each injection, RelE/Lon was released from the surface by two consecutive 30-s injections of 3 M guanidine HCl in 50% running buffer (HBS-EP: 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The response of the reference flow cell was subtracted from the response of the RelB-Cys flow cell and then from the response of a buffer injection. In order to obtain the rate constants, double reference subtracted sensorgrams were fitted (least sum of squared residuals) to a model of 1:1 binding (Langmuir binding) using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software package. Calculations of stoichiometry were carried out as described.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Tryptophan fluorescence measurements</title>
        <p>Fluorescence experiments were carried out using an LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) at 25 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence of His<sub>6</sub>-RelE protein (0.35 μM) was measured before and after addition of increasing molar amounts of RelB. All titrations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Complexes were allowed to form by gently mixing the components for 5 min in the cuvette with the aid of a small stir bar. Emission spectra were taken from 315 to 400 nm with excitation at 295 nm using a slit width of 10 nm. Data were collected by integration of five consecutive scans at a scan speed of 900 nm/min. Each data point represents the peak value (at approximately 330 nm) for the mean of five scans expressed as fractional change.</p>

        <title>Lon/RelB degradation assay</title>
        <p>To monitor the degradation of RelB, the ATP-dependent protease Lon (0.6 μM) was added to a reaction buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 4 mM ATP, 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>]. Prior to the experiments, HMK-RelB was labeled with <sup>32</sup>P on the N-terminal HMK-tag (RRASV) using the PKAce kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Formation of complexes between HMK-RelB and His<sub>6</sub>-RelE was achieved by preincubating 0.13 μM HMK-RelB with 0.52 μM His<sub>6</sub>-RelE at ambient temperature for 20 min. HMK-RelB (0.13 μM), free or in complex, was finally added to the reaction mixture in a final volume of 20 μl and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure. Degradation was stopped by adding SDS-loading buffer and boiling of the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 16% Tris–tricine gels<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> and visualized by phosphoimaging of the dried gels.</p>

        <title>Modeling of the RelB–DNA complex</title>
        <p>Modelling of RelB–DNA was done using structures of the N-terminal domain of RelB (RelB<sub>1–50</sub>) [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2k29] and of the Arc–DNA complex (PDB 1bdt) as template. The backbone of the RelB<sub>1–50</sub> dimer was superimposed onto the template RHH dimer structure by using the VMD plugin multiseq.</p>

        <p>RelB mutants defective in transcriptional autoregulation. (a) Schematic of pMO2541 carrying a translational <italic>relBE<sup>R81A</sup>::lacZ</italic> fusion used to insert mutagenic PCR fragments of <italic>relB</italic> in order to screen for derepressed (blue) mutant colonies on X-gal indicator plates. (b) Multiple alignment of the RHH motifs of RelB, <italic>E. coli</italic>; RelB, <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic>; RelB2 (DinJ), <italic>E. coli</italic>; FitA, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>; and Arc, bacteriophage P22. Residues are marked by decreasing conservation: white text on black boxes; white text on dark grey boxes and black text on grey boxes. Vertical arrows indicate the amino acid substitutions that were found in the RelB RHH variants obtained in the screen. Amino acids shown in black were obtained in combination with one of the other mutations, whereas amino acids colored in red were obtained independently in each clone. The aspartate colored in blue is encoded by the previously described <italic>relB101</italic> allele. Amino acids in the alignment marked by asterisks were selected for further mutant characterization in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and are color coded according to representations in (c) and (d). The location of the RHH secondary structure in RelB is depicted by a black arrow and grey boxes, respectively. (c) Side view of a structure model of the RelB–DNA complex based on the NMR structure of RelB<sub>1–50</sub> (PDB ID 2k29) and the crystal structure of the Arc–DNA complex (PDB ID 1bdt). Two RelB<sub>1–50</sub> dimers were modeled on a 22-nucleotide double-stranded fragment representing Arc operator DNA. RelB<sub>1–50</sub> monomers of each dimer are colored green and red or yellow and blue, respectively. Side chains of the conserved R7 amino acid (grey spheres) from the β-strand of each subunit make sequence-specific base interactions in DNA major grooves. Side chains of the conserved S28 (cyan spheres) from the N-terminal part of helix α2 make unspecific DNA sugar–phosphate backbone interactions. Side chains of K13 (magenta spheres) from the N-terminal part of helix α1 make putative electrostatic DNA sugar–phosphate backbone interactions. (d) Side view of (c) by 90° rotation along the <italic>y</italic>-axis. The representations were prepared in PyMOL.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>

The reference-subtracted response difference in resonance units (RU) for each concentration used is shown in the sensorgram. RelE concentrations from top to bottom: 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 0 nM. Dashed lines indicate fitted values used to obtain the rate constants (see the text). (b) Tryptophan fluorescence analysis of the RelB–RelE interaction. Complex formation was monitored by stoichiometric titration of RelE (0.35 μM) with RelB. RelE tryptophans were excited at 295 nm, and the emission signal was monitored from 315 to 400 nm. The maxima values at approximately 330 nm are represented as fractional change. Each point represents the average of four measurements. Error bars represents the standard deviation.</p>

        <p>RelB is degraded by Lon protease. (a and b) SPR analysis. RelB-Cys was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and Lon was injected at a concentration of 200 nM with (red sensorgram) or without (blue sensorgram) MgCl<sub>2</sub> (8 mM) and ATP (2 mM) in the buffer as indicated by arrows in the figure. At time ∼ 450 s, the dissociation phase was initiated with (red sensorgram) or without (blue line) MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP in the buffer. Finally, a second dissociation phase at time ∼ 550 s was initiated by changing to buffer without MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP (red sensorgram only). For kinetic measurements, the following Lon concentrations were used: from top to bottom, 100, 50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 and 0 nM. (c) <italic>In vitro</italic> degradation of HMK-RelB. Lon and <sup>32</sup>P[HMK-RelB] were incubated at 37 °C for 120 min (lanes 1–5) or the times indicated (lanes 6–12) in reaction buffer with or without the components specified and subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging. In control reactions (lanes 1 and 6) Lon was omitted.</p>

        <p>Model explaining regulation of the <italic>relBE</italic> locus. The <italic>relBE</italic> operon has a typical TA organization. The first gene encodes the RelB antitoxin (green) and the second gene encodes mRNA interferase and co-repressor RelE (red). RelB is produced in ∼ 10 fold excess of RelE due to coupled translation (bent arrow, +). RelB monomers readily form dimers via their N-terminal RHH domain and interact with RelE monomers to form a tight nontoxic complex. During exponential growth, RelE is exclusively bound by RelB. This complex forms a heterohexamer when bound to <italic>relO</italic>, which involves cooperativity mediated by co-repressor RelE. The repression complex bound to its operator overlapping the − 10 box in the promoter region prevents transcription initiation of RNA polymerase and results in a low level of <italic>relBE</italic> expression. In steady-state and upon stress induced growth arrest, the ATP-dependent protease Lon degrades RelB at a high rate. Lon degrades RelB in its free states and in complex with RelE. A reduction in the global rate of translation as a consequence of stress shifts the RelE equilibrium toward free RelE as the level of RelB declines. This shift in the ratio between RelB and RelE results in derepression of the promoter due to loss of cooperativity in the repression complex. Increased transcription may contribute to a decrease in the RelB/RelE ratio in concert with enhanced activity of Lon. As a result RelE is free to act on its target, the ribosomal A-site, to promote codon-specific cleavage of mRNA. This in turn reduces energy consumption in the cell and may yield a lower level of translation errors.</p>
