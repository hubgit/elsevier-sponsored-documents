      <abstract>
        <p>The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major fungal pathogen of humans, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock and activates the transcription of genes with heat shock elements (HSEs) in their promoters, these genes contributing to thermal adaptation. However, the relevance of Hsf1 activation to <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence is not clear as this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals, and this issue has not been tested because <italic>HSF1</italic> is essential for viability in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In this study, we demonstrate that the HSE regulon is active in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells infecting the kidney. We also show the CE2 region of Hsf1 is required for activation and that the phosphorylation of specific residues in this domain contributes to Hsf1 activation. <italic>C. albicans HSF1</italic> mutants that lack this CE2 region are viable. However, they are unable to activate HSE-containing genes in response to heat shock, and they are thermosensitive. Using this <italic>HSF1</italic> CE2 deletion mutant we demonstrate that Hsf1 activation, and hence thermal adaptation, contributes significantly to the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The major fungal pathogen of humans, <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> exists in many healthy individuals as a relatively harmless commensal organism in the microflora of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (<xref rid="b0145 b0035" ref-type="bibr">Odds, 1988; Calderone, 2002</xref>). However, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is also a frequent cause of mucosal infections such as oral thrush and vaginitis (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Ruhnke, 2002</xref>). These infections generally arise when host immune defenses are weakened or the local microflora is disturbed. In patients with severely compromised immune defenses, e.g. in chemotherapy or transplant patients, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can establish potentially fatal systemic infections of the bloodstream and of major organs such as the kidney, liver and brain (<xref rid="b0070 b0105" ref-type="bibr">Filler and Kullberg, 2002; Kullberg and Filler, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>A combination of virulence factors and fitness attributes contribute to the pathogenicity of <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Virulence attributes are thought to impact directly upon interactions between the fungus and its host (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Odds et al., 2003</xref>). For example, yeast-hypha morphogenesis balances the context-dependent requirements of the fungus for rapid growth, nutrient foraging, dissemination and invasion (<xref rid="b0075 b0080 b0230" ref-type="bibr">Gow et al., 2002, 2003; Sundstrom, 2006</xref>). The secretion of aspartyl proteinases and (phospho)lipases enhance invasion and nutrient provision (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Hube and Naglik, 2002</xref>). Also, a battery of adhesins promotes attachment to host tissues (<xref rid="b0225 b0090" ref-type="bibr">Staab et al., 1999; Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>), whilst invasins enhance uptake by host cells (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Phan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast, fitness attributes enhance the physiological robustness of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells in the diverse niches they can occupy within the host. For example, effective metabolic adaptation enhances nutrient assimilation and growth (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2005</xref>), whereas robust stress responses are thought to help protect the fungus against environmental insults and host immune defences (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Quinn and Brown, 2007</xref>). Oxidative, nitrosative, osmotic and thermal stress responses in particular have attracted significant interest in the field (<xref rid="b0190 b0005 b0210 b0240 b0095 b0040 b0065 b0020" ref-type="bibr">San Jose et al., 1996; Alonso-Monge et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2004; Ullmann et al., 2004; Hromatka et al., 2005; Chauhan et al., 2006; Enjalbert et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The generally held view is that fungal virulence factors and fitness attributes have evolved relatively rapidly, allowing species to adapt to the diverse niches they occupy. With regard to stress regulation in the fungi, sensors and upstream signalling components display a high degree of evolutionary divergence, as do the transcription factors that drive the corresponding adaptive responses (<xref rid="b0030 b0140 b0170" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2009; Nikolaou et al., 2009; Rispail et al., 2009</xref>). Also, while core stress regulatory modules are highly conserved, in some cases their cellular roles have diverged. For example, while AP1-like transcription factors such as Yap1, Cap1 and Pap1 drive transcriptional responses to oxidative stress (<xref rid="b0055 b0050 b0260" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2008; Znaidi et al., 2009</xref>), the stress activated protein kinases Hog1 and Sty1 mediate responses to different types of stress in evolutionarily divergent yeasts (<xref rid="b0045 b0155 b0065" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2003; O’Rourke and Herskowitz, 2004; Enjalbert et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, the downstream adaptive responses driven by these pathways are well conserved. For example, glycerol is generally accumulated as an osmolyte during adaptation to osmotic stress, and thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems are induced to mediate redox adaptation in response to reactive oxygen species.</p>
      <p>Historically, the heat shock response in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been of interest because, although additional factors probably influence morphogenesis in the host, temperature up-shifts are associated with the yeast-to-hyphal transition (<xref rid="b0235 b0200" ref-type="bibr">Swoboda et al., 1995; Shapiro et al., 2009</xref>) and because Hsp90 fragments are immuno-protective in systemic candidiasis (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 1991</xref>). We became interested in the heat shock response and its regulation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> because this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Odds, 1988</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>C. albicans</italic> does activate a <italic>bona fide</italic> transcriptional response to an acute heat shock (<xref rid="b0060 b0135" ref-type="bibr">Enjalbert et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>), and that an evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, plays a central role in this response (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). We also demonstrated that Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock, that Hsf1 activates transcription via heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoters of its target genes, and that transcriptional activation by Hsf1 is specific for heat shock and is not triggered by other medically relevant stresses (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Why then has a heat shock response been retained in this pathogen during evolution if it is obligately associated with warm blooded animals? We reasoned that the primary role of Hsf1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <italic>in vivo</italic> might be to mediate thermal homeostasis rather than adaptation to acute heat shocks. In other words, Hsf1 might play an essential role <italic>in vivo</italic> by tuning the levels of essential <italic>C. albicans</italic> chaperones such as Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp104 to the growth temperature of the host niche. This is not possible to test using <italic>hsf1/hsf1</italic> null mutants because <italic>HSF1</italic> is essential for viability in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, in this study we have tested this hypothesis by generating <italic>C. albicans HSF1</italic> mutants in which basal Hsf1 activity is retained, but heat shock activation has been blocked. We show that a specific domain of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1 is required for heat shock activation and that phosphorylation at specific sites within this domain contribute to Hsf1 activation. We confirm that HSE-containing genes are activated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> during systemic infection of the kidney and that Hsf1 activation is required for the full virulence of <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Hence, thermal homeostasis is integral to the adaptation of this fungus during pathogenesis.</p>

        <p>Doxycycline-conditional <italic>C. albicans</italic> <italic>HSF1</italic> mutants were generated as previously described for CLM62-1 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>HSF1</italic> truncation mutants were created using the mini Ura-blaster cassette (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>) in an <italic>hsf1/HSF1</italic> background (CLM61-1: <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, <italic>HSF1::hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> truncation cassettes were created by PCR amplification using the primers HSF1-CTMt-F, HSF1-CTMt-R, HSF1-CE2t-F and HSF1-CE2t-R (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These cassettes were then transformed into <italic>C. albicans</italic> CLM61-1 to delete codons 566–762 of the <italic>HSF1</italic> open reading frame to create the allele CE2t (strain SN127), and to delete codons 732–762 of <italic>HSF1</italic> to generate the allele CTMt (strain SN128: <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Ura3-</italic>minus segregant of SN127 and SN128 were then selected by growth on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>), and the genotypes of these strains confirmed by PCR diagnosis. The HSE-lacZ and Basal-lacZ reporters (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>) were then transformed into these <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains selecting for the <italic>URA3</italic> marker (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Murad et al., 2000</xref>). Correct integration was confirmed by PCR diagnosis with oligonucleotides RPS1-GEN and LacZ-F (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Hsf1 phosphorylation mutants were created by mutagenesis of plasmid pACT1pHSF1 (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). First, the CE2 domain was deleted (codons 564–578) by inverse PCR using oligos CE2 del F/R (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) thereby introducing an internal BamHI site. The resultant plasmid was called pΔCE2. Second, oligonucleotides All WT-F/R (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were annealed and cloned into this new BamHI site to recreate the wild type sequence (pSDM-WT). Third, oligonucleotides All E-F/R and All A-F/R (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were annealed and cloned into the BamHI site to generate <italic>HSF1</italic> alleles with either S571E, T575E, S577E, T578E mutations (pSDM-E) or S571A, T575A, S577A, T578A mutations (pSDM-A). These plasmids were integrated into <italic>C. albicans</italic> CAI4 selecting for the <italic>URA3</italic> marker, and into <italic>C. albicans</italic> CLM62-1 using the <italic>NAT1</italic> marker. Correct genomic integration was confirmed by PCR using oligos D1, D2, HSF-F and RPS1-GEN (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>The virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains SC5314, CE2t, CTMt and Basal-lacZ (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was assessed in the mouse intravenous challenge model of systemic candidiasis (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum et al., 2010</xref>). Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old; Harlan, UK) were infected intravenously with a saline suspension of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (5.6–5.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g mouse body weight) from cultures grown overnight in NGY medium (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum and Odds, 2005</xref>). After 72 h of infection, animals were weighed, humanely terminated, and their kidneys removed aseptically. One kidney from each animal was used to assay fungal burdens. Infection Outcome Scores were calculated on the basis of fungal burdens and animal weights, as described previously (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum et al., 2010</xref>). The second kidney from each animal was snap frozen for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>To analyse gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains SC5314, Basal-lacZ and HSE-lacZ (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were used to initiate infections in mice. For each strain, a saline suspension (2.4–4.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/g mouse body weight), prepared from overnight cultures in NGY medium, was used to intravenously infect six female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old; Harlan, UK). Mice were monitored daily and culled when they showed signs of illness and/or when they had lost 20% body weight. Mice were humanely terminated and the kidneys aseptically removed. One kidney was used for fungal burden determination and the other was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analyses (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>For virulence assays, kidney fungal burdens and infection outcome scores were compared by Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests. All statistic analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics package 17.0.</p>

        <title>The CE2 domain is required for Hsf1-mediated transcriptional activation</title>
        <p>Eukaryotic heat shock transcription factors are well conserved and have similar structures. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Hsf1 is an 833 amino acid protein that contains a winged-helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD: residues 168–284), a hydrophobic repeat region necessary for coiled-coil formation during Hsf1p trimerization (residues 326–424), amino-terminal and carboxy-proximal transcriptional activation domains (AR1 and AR2: residues 1–424 and 583–782, respectively), a negative regulatory domain (CE2: residues 535–550), and a carboxy-terminal modulator domain that alleviates the repression by CE2 in response to heat shock (CTM: residues 783–833) (<xref rid="b0195 b0185 b0085" ref-type="bibr">Santoro et al., 1998; Sakurai and Fukasawa, 2001; Hashikawa and Sakurai, 2004</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1 displays homology to these domains (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our first aim was to test the functional significance of the putative regulatory domains located in the carboxy-terminal half of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1. Therefore we set out to create <italic>HSF1</italic> truncation mutants in which the CTM domain alone, the AR2 and CTM domains together, and then all three carboxy-terminal domains (CE2-AR2-CTM) were selectively deleted. The approach was to create the truncations by integrating a <italic>URA3</italic> cassette at the 3′ end of the remaining wild type allele in the <italic>hsf1/HSF1</italic> heterozygote, CLM61-1 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Strains carrying the CTM (CTMt) and CE2-AR2-CTM (CE2t) truncations were successfully generated (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), but parallel attempts to generate an AR2-CTM truncation were not.</p>
        <p>We then tested the impact of the CTMt and CE2t truncations upon Hsf1 function. Hsf1 is known to mediate the activation of HSE-containing genes in response to heat shock (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we compared <italic>HSP70</italic>, <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNA levels in strains expressing wild type and truncated forms of Hsf1 by northern analysis (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). As expected, untreated cells expressing wild type Hsf1 expressed <italic>HSP70</italic> and <italic>HSP90</italic> at high basal levels, and the levels of these mRNAs increased following heat shock (30 °C to 45 °C for 30 min). <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNA levels were below detectable levels in untreated cells and were significantly induced in heat shocked cells. These data are entirely consistent with our previous observations (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, truncation of the CTM domain did not affect the basal levels of the <italic>HSP70</italic>, <italic>HSP90</italic> or <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNAs, nor did it impair the ability of Hsf1 to increase their expression in response to heat shock (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). This suggests that the CTM domain is not required to alleviate repression of Hsf1 activity in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, in contrast to the situation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai and Fukasawa, 2001</xref>). In contrast the CE2t truncation attenuated the heat shock induction of the <italic>HSP70</italic>, <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNAs.</p>
        <p>This finding was assessed further by assaying the activation of the HSE-lacZ reporter in <italic>HSF1,</italic> CE2t and CTMt cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The heat shock activation of this HSE-lacZ reporter in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been shown to be dependent upon Hsf1 (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Not surprisingly, therefore, this reporter was strongly activated in response to heat shock in cells expressing wild type Hsf1. Some attenuation of this activation was observed following truncation of the CTM domain. However, activation was almost completely inhibited in cells expressing the CE2 truncation, thereby confirming that Hsf1 is unable to activate HSE-containing promoters following deletion of the CE2, AR2 and CTM domains.</p>
        <p>Taken together our data suggested that sequences in the CE2-AR2 region are required for Hsf1-mediated transcriptional activation in response to heat shock. To test whether deletion of the CE2-AR2 region also alters the thermotolerance of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, strains expressing wild type or truncated versions of Hsf1 were grown at different temperatures (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). Cells expressing wild type or CTMt versions of Hsf1 were able to grow up to 42 °C (the maximum temperature tested at which wild type cells grew). In contrast cells expressing the CE2 truncation were thermo-sensitive. Therefore, there was a strong correlation between the ability of Hsf1 molecules to activate transcription in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the thermotolerance of the corresponding cells. This result is consistent with the behaviour of Hsf1 truncations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where removal of sequences after Hsf1 residue 583 blocks Hsf1 activation and renders cells temperature sensitive for growth at 37 °C (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Morano et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation within the Hsf1 CE2 domain affects thermotolerance</title>
        <p><italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1 is known to be activated by hyperphosphorylation in response to heat shock (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>), but the residues phosphorylated in response to heat shock have not yet been identified. Recently, two independent studies of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> phosphoproteome have identified four residues within the CE2 domain of Hsf1 that can be phosphorylated: S571, T575, S577 and T578 (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Beltrao et al., 2009</xref>; Kaffarnik and Peck, unpublished). The impact of heat shock on Hsf1 phosphorylation was not investigated in these studies. Nevertheless, phosphorylation at these residues might contribute to the heat shock activation of Hsf1.</p>
        <p>To test this possibility, the corresponding <italic>HSF1</italic> codons were all mutated either to alanine (SDM-A) or glutamate codons (SDM-E) to generate non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic versions of Hsf1, respectively. Cells expressing these alleles were compared with cells expressing an equivalent wild type construct (SDM-WT: <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These constructs were expressed with amino-terminal FLAG tags to permit detection by immunoblot analysis (Section <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that, as expected the FLAG-tagged wild type Hsf1 was phosphorylated in response to heat shock (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The SDM-A and SDM-E also showed gel shifts following heat shock that were resolved by treatment with λ phosphatase. Therefore, further residues in <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1, in addition to S571, T575, S577 and T578, are phosphorylated in response to heat shock.</p>
        <p>We tested whether mutagenesis of the Hsf1 phosphosites at S571, T575, S577 and T578 affects the thermotolerance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by examining cell viability after a 30–45 °C heat shock (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). The SDM-WT, SDM-A and SDM-E <italic>HSF1</italic> alleles were transformed into the doxycycline-conditional <italic>hsf1/tet-HSF1</italic> mutant (CLM62-1) to generate strains SN254-257 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Cells were grown in YPD containing doxycycline at 30 °C for 6 h to down-regulate the <italic>tet-HSF1</italic> conditional allele (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Cells were then either subjected to heat shock from 30 °C to 45 °C for 30 min, or maintained at 30 °C as a control, and then cell viabilities measured by plating (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Cells expressing the phosphomimetic SDM-E allele displayed a significant increase in heat resistance compared to the SDM-WT control, whereas cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable SDM-A allele showed a small but statistically significant decrease in thermotolerance. These results suggest that, although additional Hsf1 residues appear to be phosphorylated in response to heat shock, the observed phosphorylation at S571, T575, S577 and T578 contributes to thermotolerance in <italic>C. albicans.</italic></p>

        <title>Deletion of the Hsf1 CE2 domain blocks Hsf1 phosphorylation and confers thermosensitivity upon <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
        <p>To test whether the additional phosphorylation sites in Hsf1 are located within the CE2 domain, we generated a new <italic>HSF1</italic> allele that lacks this domain (ΔCE2: <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This <italic>HSF1</italic> allele was expressed with an analogous amino-terminal FLAG tag to the SDM alleles described above (Section <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of the wild type SDM-WT control once again confirmed that Hsf1 is phosphorylated in response to heat shock (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). In contrast, no detectable phosphorylation of Hsf1 lacking the CE2 domain, was observed, suggesting that most, if not all, of the phosphorylated residues lie within this domain.</p>
        <p>We tested whether deletion of the Hsf1 CE2 domain has a concomitant effect upon thermotolerance. This was the case when growth of the ΔCE2 mutant was compared with the wild type control on plates at 37 °C (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B) and when their viabilities were compared after a 30–42 °C heat shock (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Significantly, the viability of the ΔCE2 mutant (in which Hsf1 phosphorylation was blocked) was lower than the SDM-A mutant (in which some Hsf1 phosphorylation was retained) (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Therefore, all of the mutants we examined exhibited a strong correlation between the extent of Hsf1 phosphorylation and the degree of thermotolerance. These results reinforce the idea that thermal adaptation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is dependent upon Hsf1 activation by phosphorylation in the CE2 domain.</p>

        <title>The C. albicans Hsf1-HSE regulon is activated during systemic infection of the kidney</title>
        <p>Is the Hsf1-HSE regulon required to drive thermal homeostasis during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections? Our first step towards addressing this major question was to test whether the Hsf1-HSE regulon is expressed during systemic kidney infections by qRT-PCR.</p>
        <p>Our starting point involved the calibration of our qRT-PCR quantification methods using <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells grown at defined temperatures <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells expressing HSE-lacZ in a wildtype <italic>HSF1/HSF1</italic> background (SN2: <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were grown at 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C or 40 °C. RNA was isolated from these cultures and the expression of the <italic>lacZ,</italic> <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNAs measured relative to the internal <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA control. In addition, we examined <italic>ENO1</italic> mRNA levels (relative to <italic>ACT1</italic>) as a non-heat shock inducible control. <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA levels increased when the growth temperature increased above 30 °C (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), which was entirely consistent with the growth temperature-related increase in β-galactosidase expression levels that we observed previously (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). The qRT-PCR data confirmed that the expression of this Hsf1-dependent reporter is modulated at the transcript level in response to growth temperature. Furthermore, analogous increases in the levels of the Hsf1-regulated transcripts <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> were observed at growth temperatures above 30 °C (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Indeed the correlation between the <italic>lacZ,</italic> <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> transcript levels was very strong (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ENO1</italic> mRNA levels did not increase with growth temperature (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), and the correlation between <italic>ENO1</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> transcript levels, for example, was weak (−0.43 <italic>in vitro,</italic> and −0.13 <italic>in vivo</italic>). Data from independent experiments confirmed the reproducibility of these observations, thereby reinforcing the idea that the Hsf1-HSE regulon tunes the expression of essential chaperones to the growth temperature of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
        <p>Next we examined <italic>lacZ,</italic> <italic>HSP90</italic>, <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>ENO1</italic> transcript levels <italic>in vivo,</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells from infected kidneys. Mice were sacrificed between days 3–10 after being injected intravenously with <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 (<italic>HSF1/HSF1</italic> control), SN1 (<italic>HSF1/HSF1</italic> cells containing Basal-lacZ) or SN2 (<italic>HSF1/HSF1</italic> cells containing HSE-lacZ) (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), once infection had progressed to a point when high kidney fungal burdens were obtained (kidney fungal burdens = 6.1 ± 0.7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g). We used the clinical isolate, SC5314, as the infection control in this experiment because the virulence of this strain has been shown to be equivalent to <italic>C. albicans</italic> CAI4 cells carrying CIp10 (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2009</xref>), the vector used to generate pBasal-lacZ and pHSE-lacZ (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). To maintain the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptome, kidneys were rapidly dissected, snap frozen and the tissues fixed before RNA preparation (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2009</xref>: Materials and methods). Transcript levels were then measured by qRT-PCR relative to the internal <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA control (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>As expected, no detectable <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA was seen in <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5134 cells, and minimal <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA levels were observed in SN1 cells (Basal-lacZ) from kidney infections in independent animals (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). In contrast significant <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA levels were observed in SN2 cells (HSE-lacZ) infecting the kidney, indicating that the Hsf1-HSE regulon is activated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> during systemic infections. Also <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> were expressed during experimental infections with <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5134 and SN1 (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). These <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains do not contain the HSE-lacZ reporter, but they do contain an intact Hsf1-HSE regulon. Therefore, these data strengthen the idea that the Hsf1-HSE regulon is activated during systemic infections of the kidney.</p>
        <p>HSE-lacZ expression levels did vary significantly between individual infected animals. However, HSE-lacZ mRNA levels correlated well with the <italic>HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> transcripts in these infections (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B; <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In contrast the levels of these transcripts did not correlate with <italic>ENO1</italic> mRNA levels, indicating that this experimental variation was not due to technical noise but to <italic>bona fide</italic> regulation of the Hsf1-HSE regulon <italic>in vivo</italic>. This Hsf1-HSE regulon appears to be induced specifically in response to temperatures above about 30 °C (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together our data suggest variation in the temperatures of individual animals with systemic candidiasis. Such variation has been observed previously in animals with severe <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Spellberg et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hsf1 activation contributes significantly to the virulence of C. albicans</title>
        <p>The above observations suggested that thermal homeostasis might contribute significantly to the physiological fitness of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and hence that Hsf1 might contribute to the virulence of this pathogen. However, <italic>HSF1</italic> is an essential gene in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>) and therefore it was not possible to test this hypothesis using <italic>hsf1/hsf1</italic> null mutants. Nevertheless, having constructed a <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutant in which Hsf1 is not activated (CE2t) it became possible to test whether activation of the Hsf1-HSE regulon is required for virulence in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
        <p>Mice were infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic> SN127 (CE2t) and with the control strains SC5314 and SN128 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The clinical isolate SC5314 represented a wild type control. SN128 expressed the heat shock-inducible Hsf1 CTMt truncation mutant, thereby controlling for the molecular manipulations used to generate the Hsf1 CE2t mutant. The challenge dose for the virulence assays was chosen to produce infection outcome scores of approximately 14 at day 3 post-infection for the wild type control strain (challenge dose = 5.6–5.8 × 104 CFU/g body weight). Virulence was assayed by determining infection outcome scores, based upon weight change and kidney burdens at 3 days post-infection (Materials and methods; <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">MacCallum et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The CTMt cells displayed similar fungal burdens and outcome scores to the wild type control, indicating that our molecular approaches <italic>per se</italic> had not impaired the virulence of <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Furthermore, inclusion of strain SN2 in these virulence experiments confirmed that the HSE-lacZ construct used in the above experiments (Section <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>) did not affect the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The CE2t mutant displayed significantly reduced fungal burdens and outcome scores compared with the control strains (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Furthermore, a 10-fold increase in challenge inoculum did not increase infection outcome score (not shown), demonstrating the severe virulence attenuation of this strain. This indicated that Hsf1 induction is required for the full virulence of <italic>C. albicans.</italic></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we report two important conclusions relating to heat shock regulation in the fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>. First, we conclude that the CE2 domain of the essential heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, is required for its activation in response to heat shock. This CE2 domain lies between the trimerisation region and the activation domain AR2 of Hsf1 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Mutations that remove this CE2 domain block heat shock activation of the <italic>HSP70, HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> mRNAs and of the Hsf1-dependent HSE-lacZ reporter (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B), confer thermosensitivity upon <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="f0010 f0015 f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C, 3B and 4</xref>B), and block the heat shock inducible hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). These data highlight the importance of the CE2 domain in the regulation of Hsf1 activity, and also demonstrate the importance of Hsf1 activation for thermal adaptation in <italic>C. albicans.</italic></p>
      <p>The CE2 domain harbours four amino acid residues at which phosphorylation has been detected in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells: S571, T575, S577 and T578 (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Beltrao et al., 2009</xref>; Kaffarnik and Peck, unpublished). However, these high throughput studies did not look at the proteome under heat shock conditions. Therefore, we tested whether phosphorylation at these residues contributes Hsf1 activation. We showed that blocking phosphorylation at S571, T575, S577 and T578 (SDM-A) attenuated the thermal resistance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> slightly, whereas phosphomimetic mutations at these sites (SDM-E) slightly increased thermotolerance (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). However, some Hsf1 phosphorylation was retained in these mutants (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), and deletion of the whole CE2 domain conferred a greater effect upon <italic>C. albicans</italic> thermotolerance than mutagenesis of S571, T575, S577 and T578 alone (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). We conclude that while phosphorylation at these four residues contributes to Hsf1 activation, additional phosphorylation sites exist within Hsf1, probably in the CE2 domain (e.g. at S567 and/or S573). However, we do not exclude the possibility that mutagenesis of CE2 inhibits phosphorylation elsewhere in Hsf1.</p>
      <p>Our second important conclusion is that activation of the Hsf1-HSE regulon contributes significantly to the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Two key observations underpin this conclusion. Firstly, preventing the activation of Hsf1 severely attenuates the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Deleting the Hsf1 CTM domain did not attenuate virulence (CTMt), whereas further truncation of CE2 and AR2 domains (CE2t) significantly attenuated virulence, although the slow growth of this latter mutant at 37 °C probably contributed to this phenotype (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Secondly, the Hsf1-HSE regulon is activated during systemic kidney infections (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, there was variation in the degree of activation of the Hsf1-HSE regulon between experimental infections. Some of this variability may be intrinsic to the mice and in particular to the differing rates of progression in individual animals. This affected the times at which samples were taken for analysis post-infection, which might have contributed to this variation (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Nevertheless, this observation is consistent with variation in the temperatures of individual animals with systemic candidiasis, some animals being febrile, others not (<xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Spellberg et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these data are entirely consistent with the hypothesis that Hsf1 is essential for thermal homeostasis in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> tuning the levels of essential chaperones to the temperature of the local microenvironment. This proposed function does not preclude a role for Hsf1 in protection against acute heat shocks in <italic>C. albicans.</italic> However, it is not clear when this pathogen might be exposed to the sudden and dramatic temperature up-shifts associated with the experimental heat shocks induced <italic>in vitro,</italic> given that <italic>C. albicans</italic> is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Odds, 1988</xref>).</p>

        <p>Construction of <italic>C. albicans HSF1</italic> mutants. The top line illustrates the domain structure of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsf1, roughly to scale, by analogy to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hsf1. Hsf1 domains include two transcriptional activation regions (AR1 and AR2), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a trimerisation region (TRI), a control element (CE2) and a carboxy-terminal region (CTM). Schematic representations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutations created in this study lie below the wild type Hsf1 structure (Hsf1). Truncations of the CTM region (CTMt) and all of the carboxy-terminus up to and including the CE2 region (CE2t) were created at the <italic>HSF1</italic> locus in an <italic>HSF1/hsf1</italic> heterozygote, these constructs being expressed from the endogenous <italic>HSF1</italic> promoter. Hsf1 phosphorylation sites in the CE2 region are highlighted in yellow. <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites were introduced on each site of the CE2 region to create the wild type control (SDM-WT) for the subsequent site directed mutagenesis of these sites to alanine, in blue (SDM-A) or glutamate, in red (SDM-E). The CE2 region was also deleted from SDM-WT to create the mutation ΔCE2. These constructs were expressed from the <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter (Section <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Removal of the CE2 and AR2 regions attenuates the ability of Hsf1 to activate the HSE regulon in response to heat shock and confers thermosensitivity. (A) Northern analysis of the <italic>HSP70, HSP90</italic> and <italic>HSP140</italic> mRNAs using <italic>ACT1</italic> as an internal loading control. RNA was isolated from <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains <italic>hsf1/HSF1</italic> (CLM61-1), CE2t (SN127) and CTMt (SN128) (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) grown at 30 °C in YPD to exponential phase and then subjected to a 30 to 45 °C heat shock for 30 min, or maintained at 30 °C (control).

(A) Mutagenesis of putative phosphorylation sites at S571, T575, S577 and S578 does not prevent Hsf1 phosphorylation. <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells expressing different FLAG-tagged Hsf1 mutants were subjected to a 30 to 45 °C heat shock or maintained at 30 °C, and protein extracts analysed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody: SDM-WT, SN250; SDM-A, SN251; SDM-E, SN252 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Some extracts were also treated with λ phosphatase to confirm that the observed band shifts represented Hsf1 phosphorylation.
