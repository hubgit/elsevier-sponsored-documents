        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Ribosomal processing requires a series of endo- and exonucleolytic steps for the production of mature ribosomes, of which most have been described. To ensure ribosome synthesis, 3′ end formation of rRNA uses multiple nucleases acting in parallel; however, a similar parallel mechanism had not been described for 5′ end maturation. Here, we identify Rrp17p as a previously unidentified 5′–3′ exonuclease essential for ribosome biogenesis, functioning with Rat1p in a parallel processing pathway analogous to that of 3′ end formation. Rrp17p is required for efficient exonuclease digestion of the mature 5′ ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNAs, contains a catalytic domain close to its N terminus, and is highly conserved among higher eukaryotes, being a member of a family of exonucleases. We show that Rrp17p binds late pre-60S ribosomes, accompanying them from the nucleolus to the nuclear periphery, and provide evidence for physical and functional links between late 60S subunit processing and export.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is a highly coordinated process that largely takes place in the nucleolus. Work by many groups has defined the processing pathway for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and identified ∼170 proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, while proteomic analyses have provided a roughly outlined pathway of preribosome assembly in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="bib17 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002; Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). Three of the four rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, and 25/28S rRNA) are derived from the 35S rRNA precursor transcribed by RNA polymerase I, while the fourth rRNA (5S rRNA) is transcribed separately by RNA polymerase III. The 35S pre-rRNA is packaged into a 90S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) together with a subset of assembly factors and ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). After undergoing extensive site-specific modifications, internal and external spacer regions (ITS and ETS) are removed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>) by an ordered series of endonucleolytic cleavages and exonucleolytic digestion steps to form functional 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>A large number of studies have made it clear that, apart from the r-proteins, a multitude of <italic>trans</italic>-acting, nonribosomal factors play a crucial role in the assembly of functional eukaryotic ribosomes (<xref rid="bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002; Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>). Although the precise function of many of these factors is still unknown, recent data have shown that some of them determine separate but parallel-acting assembly and processing routes that ensure maturation of preribosomes through a network of redundant parallel pathways (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pérez-Fernández et al., 2007</xref>). One such example of a parallel pathway is the maturation of 5.8S rRNA. Roughly 80% of 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA is cleaved at site A<sub>3</sub> by RNase MRP, and the resulting 27SA<sub>3</sub> precursor is processed exonucleolytically into 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA; however, the remaining 20% are converted into the 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA by an endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). As a result, two mature 5.8S rRNA species (5.8S<sub>L</sub> [long] and 5.8S<sub>S</sub> [short]) are produced, in a ratio of about 1:5.</p>
      <p>The 5′ end maturation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> (and 25S rRNA) in yeast has been attributed to the nuclear 5′–3′ exonuclease Rat1p and its cofactor Rai1p (<xref rid="bib10 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Henry et al., 1994</xref>). Its cytoplasmic homolog Xrn1p is involved in the degradation of aberrant rRNA precursors, and its absence does not affect the ratio of 5.8S L:S rRNAs (<xref rid="bib10 bib25" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Johnson, 1997</xref>). However, defects in both 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNA maturation were exacerbated by deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> in cells depleted for Rat1p, indicating that Xrn1p could take over rRNA maturation steps in its absence (<xref rid="bib10 bib21 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Geerlings et al., 2000; Henry et al., 1994</xref>). While Rat1p seems to be the only 5′–3′ exonuclease implicated in the maturation of 5′ ends, 3′ end formation of 5.8S rRNA involves multiple nucleases that act sequentially to ensure correct and precise trimming of the pre-rRNA (<xref rid="bib5 bib8 bib13 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et al., 1998; de la Cruz et al., 1998; Faber et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of any one of these nucleases, 3′ end maturation still occurs, albeit not as efficiently (<xref rid="bib2 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Allmang et al., 2000; de la Cruz et al., 1998</xref>). This ensures that even in the absence of one of these nucleases, production of mature ribosomal subunits still continues. However, a similarly redundant mechanism involving multiple nucleases had not been uncovered for 5′ end maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNA. Here, we describe the characterization of the yeast protein Ydr412p as a highly conserved exonuclease that is required for the 5′ end maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, demonstrating that 5′ end processing also has a redundant pathway.</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Is Part of NPC-Associated Pre-60S Ribosomal Subunits</title>
        <p>We have previously described a method for purifying yeast nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). This NPC fraction was highly enriched in proteins known to be associated with late processing and export of mRNA and ribosomal subunits, likely caught during the process of chaperoning these cargoes to and through the NPC (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2000</xref>). One of these NPC-associated proteins caught our attention; this protein, Ydr412p, had no previously assigned function, yet localized to the nucleolus, as does its human homolog, Nol12/Nop25 (<xref rid="bib24 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Huh et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>). Its association with the NPC and with the nucleolus suggested that it might be a late-acting ribosome synthesis factor. As discussed below, this hypothesis proved correct, and we have thus termed it a member of the <italic>r</italic>ibosomal <italic>R</italic>NA <italic>p</italic>rocessing family, Rrp17p.</p>
        <p>To better understand the function of Rrp17p, we isolated a genomically tagged version of the protein ex vivo to determine the proteins with which it interacts, using our fast single-step affinity purification procedure (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Oeffinger et al., 2007</xref>). We identified 109 proteins in the isolated Rrp17p complex. Ten of these were NPC components, consistent with the association of Rrp17p with NPCs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2000</xref>). We also found 48 ribosomal proteins, 45 of which were components of the large subunit, and 43 known preribosomal processing factors involved in late steps in 60S subunit maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, right) (<xref rid="bib4 bib18 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Bassler et al., 2001; Fatica et al., 2002; Nissan et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, we were able to isolate several transient components, such as nucleoporins, the pre-60S subunit export factor Crm1p, and the exonucleases Rat1p, Xrn1p, and Rrp6p (<xref rid="bib23 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with a role for Rrp17p in ribosomal maturation and/or export. In addition, we also dentified Npl3p and Yra2p. Depletion of Npl3p (Nop3p) affects ribosome synthesis (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Russell and Tollervey, 1992</xref>), but no role for Yra2p in ribosome synthesis has so far been reported.</p>
        <p>To confirm the association of Rrp17p with preribosomes, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation on whole-cell lysates from cells expressing Rrp17-Protein A (PrA) and compared the sedimentation of Rrp17-PrA to that of the pre-rRNAs of both the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>A). Rrp17-PrA cosediments with 27SB pre-RNA, a component of pre-60S subunits, but not with 20S pre-rRNA, the precursor to mature 18S rRNA and component of 40S preribosomes. We also determined which rRNA precursors were associated with the isolated Rrp17-PrA containing complexes. Coisolation was seen for late pre-60S RNA components with Rrp17-PrA complexes compared to mock purifications (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B and S2Cb-S2Ce), while no 90S (35S pre-rRNA) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>Ca) or 40S components (18S rRNA) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>D) were detected. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Rrp17p associates only with pre-60S ribosomal subunits.</p>
        <p>Using a functional GFP-tagged allele, we assessed whether the in vivo cellular localization of Rrp17p is consistent with an association with preribosomes. Rrp17p is concentrated mainly in the nucleolus, with some residual nuclear staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). This same pattern is found for numerous proteins known to associate with late preribosomes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). We also noted a faint punctate signal at the nuclear periphery, which is consistent with the association of Rrp17-GFP with the NPC. Taken together, these data indicate that Rrp17p is a bona fide component of pre-60S ribosomal subunit that associates with the complexes in the nucleolus and accompanies them to the NPC prior to their export.</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Is Involved in 5′ End Maturation of 60S Subunit rRNAs</title>
        <p>Since Rrp17p was associated with late 60S preribosomes, we examined its possible function during 60S maturation. Deletion of <italic>RRP17</italic> was shown to be lethal (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, we studied the effect of depletion of Rrp17p in a strain expressing an HA-Rrp17p fusion construct under the control of the repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter at the endogenous <italic>RRP17</italic> locus. Growth of isogenic wild-type and <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strains was identical in galactose-containing medium. However, growth of the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strain declined progressively following transfer to glucose medium (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). Northern hybridization analysis showed mild accumulation of 35S and 23S pre-rRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Ae), the latter being a product of premature cleavage of 32S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub>. The 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA also accumulated in Rrp17p-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 1-3), as well as 27SB pre-rRNA, while mature 25S rRNA was reduced ∼3-fold after 16 hr in glucose, compared to wild-type and 18S rRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Ac, 2Ad, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>A). In addition, primer extension analysis showed a moderate increase of 26S pre-rRNA, the 5′-extended precursor of 25S rRNA and product of C<sub>2</sub> cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). In wild-type cells, 26S pre-rRNA is processed very rapidly by the 5′–3′ exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p and is not usually detected (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Geerlings et al., 2000</xref>). However, accumulation of 27SB and 26S precursors suggested a delay in both cleavage at site C<sub>2</sub> and subsequent processing of 26S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). No alterations were seen in the levels of 20S pre-rRNA and mature 18S rRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Ae and 2Af).</p>
        <p>Analysis of the 5.8S rRNA synthesis pathway following transfer to glucose showed no accumulation of 7S pre-rRNA in the absence of Rrp17p, but a minor accumulation of 3′-extended intermediates indicated that 3′ end processing of 5.8S rRNA was less efficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Bd). Moreover, 5′-extended forms of 7S pre-rRNA (A<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>; A<sub>3</sub> to E) were detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Bb–2Bd), indicating that processing in ITS2 occurred prior to that in ITS1, a phenotype that has previously been observed when processing in ITS1 was slowed (<xref rid="bib12 bib14 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Eppens et al., 2002; Faber et al., 2004; Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). In addition, the Rrp17p-depleted strain showed a clear alteration in the alternative processing pathways that generate the mature 5.8S<sub>L</sub> and 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Be, lanes 3–5), in which more 5.8S<sub>L</sub> was found than in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Be, lane 1). Accumulated aberrant 5′-extended forms of 5.8S rRNA were also observed, indicating inefficient exonucleolytic maturation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA and thus a delay in ITS1 processing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Bb and 2Bc). Synthesis of 5S rRNA was not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>Bf).</p>
        <p>A switch from 5.8S<sub>S</sub> to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA was previously observed only in mutants that impair either cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> (Rrp5p or RNase MRP) or subsequent 5′ exonuclease processing to site B1<sub>S</sub>, the 5′ end of mature 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA (Rat1p and Xrn1p) (<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib15 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Eppens et al., 1999; Faber et al., 2006; Henry et al., 1994</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rrp17p is required for efficient exonuclease digestion to the mature 5′ ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S RNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). The delay in early processing at the sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub> is probably secondary, as similar effects have previously been described for several other factors, though their basis is not fully understood (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Is Involved in 5.8S<sub>S</sub> Maturation Parallel to Processing by Rat1p</title>
        <p>The formation of the 5′ end of both 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNAs has previously been attributed to the 5′–3′ exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 1994</xref>). However, deletion of the nonessential Xrn1p alone did not lead to detectable 5′ end processing defects, while depletion of the essential nuclear Rat1p exhibited significant 5.8S and 25S maturation defects, which were exacerbated by deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> in this background, indicating that Xrn1p function in 5′ end processing is seen only in the absence of Rat1p (<xref rid="bib10 bib21 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Geerlings et al., 2000; Henry et al., 1994</xref>). Hence, we focused on potential links between the functions of Rrp17p and Rat1p during 5.8S rRNA maturation in an <italic>xrn1Δ</italic> background.</p>
        <p>We constructed a <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> strain and compared synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNA to <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> and <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> strains. Analysis of the triple mutant under restrictive conditions revealed a strong accumulation of both 27SA, specifically 27SA<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Ba), and 27SB pre-rRNAs and a decrease in mature 25S rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, right a and b), whereas maturation of 18S rRNA was not affected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, right c). This suggests that processing in both ITS1 and ITS2 was delayed. In comparison, less accumulation of 27S precursors was observed in the <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> mutant under restrictive conditions, but instead, a substantial increase of 26S was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, middle a) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Geerlings et al., 2000</xref>); after 16 hr, no more 26S was detected, while levels of mature 25S rRNA remained normal. This points toward the presence of another exonuclease, taking over in the absence of both Rat1p and Xrn1p to ensure production of mature 25S rRNA. Given the phenotype of the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> strain, it is conceivable that Rrp17p may be this exonuclease. However, a potential fourth nuclease does not appear to be involved, as 25S rRNA levels reduce over time under restrictive conditions in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, right b).</p>
        <p>As previously shown, 5′-extended forms of 5.8S rRNA accumulated in <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> cells when Rat1p was depleted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 5, and 3C, lanes 7–9) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008</xref>); similar 5′-extended forms were also observed in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 3, and 3C, lanes 3–5), but not in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B lane 1, and 3C, lane 1), in restrictive medium. In contrast, the 5′ end-extended forms were not present in <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> cells when both proteins were depleted. Instead, a drastic drop in mature 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA and a switch to the 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA was observed, together with the appearance of a single 5′-extended RNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 7, and 3C, lanes 11–13). This particular 5′-extended species is believed to be generated by an endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1 at the base of the stem that lies 5′ to site B1<sub>L</sub> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008</xref>). In all three strains, precursors were not extended to site A<sub>2</sub>, indicating that cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> had occurred (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Ca). The appearance of an A<sub>3</sub>–C<sub>2</sub> fragment, however, indicates that processing in ITS2 occurs prior to ITS1, and 3′ end processing of 5.8S rRNA was also less efficient in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> strain (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B, lanes 10–13), further supporting a link between 5′ and 3′ end maturation of 5.8S rRNA.</p>
        <p>The protein Rai1p has previously been shown to function as a cofactor to Rat1p, and deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> is synthetically lethal with the <italic>rat1-1</italic> mutation (<xref rid="bib10 bib48" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2000</xref>). We tested if deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> in an Rrp17p-depleted background had any further effect on 5.8S and 25S rRNA maturation. Removal of Rai1p exacerbated the effects of Rrp17p depletion only mildly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Dc, lane 8). In comparison, deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> in <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> cells had a much stronger effect on 5.8S maturation, resulting in one 5′-extended form and a shift to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Dc, lanes 8–10) (<xref rid="bib10 bib48" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2000</xref>). A <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ/rai1Δ</italic> strain was not viable. Taken together, this indicates an essential role for Rrp17p in the 5′ exonucleolytic maturation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNA, acting in parallel to the activity of Rat1p-Rai1p.</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Exhibits 5′–3′ Exonuclease Activity In Vitro</title>
        <p>Rrp17p is a small (28 kDa) protein with a high proportion of the positively charged residues lysine (15.3%) and arginine (8.1%). Both amino acids are known to be present in many RNA-binding interfaces, as they enable RNA binding through interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terribilini et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore tested whether Rrp17p exhibits an RNA-binding activity in vitro.</p>
        <p>A gel shift assay was performed using a uniformly labeled pre-rRNA transcript, which extends from the 5′ region of ITS1 to the 3′ region of ITS2. Rrp17p clearly retarded the migration of the RNA, although the bound RNA did not migrate as a discrete species and appeared to degrade at higher concentrations of Rrp17p (as expected for a nuclease) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). However, in vitro binding of Rrp17p to RNA was not specific for pre-rRNA, as the protein bound equally well to in vitro transcribed pBluescript mRNA (data not shown).</p>
        <p>In cells lacking both Rat1p and Xrn1p, the 5′ end of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA is still synthesized, albeit with less efficiency, pointing toward the involvement of another, unknown nuclease (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore determined whether Rrp17p exhibited nuclease activity in vitro. We examined degradation of an in vitro transcribed single-strand RNA labeled at its 5′ or 3′ end and incubated with recombinant Rrp17p. Incubation of protein with 5′ end-labeled RNA resulted in the loss of substrate without any detectable shortened fragments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, left); incubation of Rrp17p with 3′ end-labeled substrate resulted in the rapid and progressive degradation of the RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, right), revealing a 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of Rrp17p in vitro.</p>
        <p>Rat1p and Xrn1p have previously been shown to be more active on substrates with a 5′ monophosphate than substrates containing a 5′ triphosphate (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Poole and Stevens, 1997</xref>). To determine whether Rp17p was sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5′ end, we prepared short, uniformly labeled mRNA substrates that were either monophosphorylated or triphosphorylated at their 5′ ends and incubated with Rrp17p. Significant differences in the efficiency of degradation between 5′-monophosphorylated and triphosphorylated substrate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S5</xref>A, and S5B) were observed, indicating that Rrp17p is indeed sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5′ end. We performed a similar analysis with substrates carrying a 5′-hydroxyl group or a 5′mG-cap structure, features known to inhibit Rat1p and Xrn1p activity (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Poole and Stevens, 1997</xref>). However, while the 5′mG-cap containing substrate was less efficiently degraded than the control 5′ or 3′ end-labeled substrates, the 5′-hydroxyl end substrate was not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S5</xref>C, and S5D); it therefore appears that Rrp17p has a somewhat different mode of function to Rat1p and Xrn1p. Lastly, we asked if Rrp17p has a specific requirement for divalent cations, as do many other nucleases. Using short, uniformly labeled mRNA substrates, the activity of Rrp17p was inhibited by replacement of MgCl<sub>2</sub> with MnCl<sub>2</sub> or by pretreatment with EDTA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>E and S5F). These results show that Rrp17p is a yeast exonuclease with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 5′–3′ activity in vitro and in vivo, which is required for 5′ end processing of 5.8S rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C, lanes 2–5).</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Possesses a Highly Conserved Domain that Is Important for Its Catalytic Activity</title>
        <p>Rrp17p does not share any significant sequence homology with any known exonucleases. However, database searches using PSI BLAST, ClustalW (UniProtK), and RNABindR revealed conserved Rrp17p homologs among fungi, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes, including <italic>Dictystelium</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Zebrafish, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mouse, and humans, with sequence similarities around 38% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib3 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1997; Terribilini et al., 2006</xref>). The human homolog Nol12, like Rrp17p, localizes mainly to the nucleolus (<xref rid="bib20 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Fujiwara et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>). All identified Rrp17p homologs contained a region of significant sequence similarity close to the N terminus; in yeast, this domain is found between amino acids 28 and 70 and is highly enriched in negatively and positively charged residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In addition, although not conserved on a sequence level, all homologs possessed a negatively charged region close to the C terminus, which was predicted to contain RNA-binding residues (RNABindR) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terribilini et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine if the conserved domain is important for RNA binding or exonuclease activity of Rrp17p, we constructed nine point mutants targeting residues potentially involved in either function within the domain. The positively charged residues arginine, lysine, and histidine and the single aromatic residues phenylalanine and tyrosine all play key roles in RNA binding (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, residues F43, R46, and R70 were each changed to alanine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Aspartic acid residues have been found in the catalytic centers of different exonucleases; thus, we also changed the aspartic acid residues at sites 32 and 38 to alanine, as well as to arginine, as this has been shown to preserve RNA binding while disrupting any potential exonuclease activity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terribilini et al., 2006</xref>). T41 is a residue that is entirely conserved in all homologs of Rrp17p, except <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where it has been replaced by serine. Thus, we converted T41 to an alanine residue. As both threonine and serine are kinase targets, this position represents a potential phosphorylation site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terribilini et al., 2006</xref>), and so we also replaced T41 with aspartic acid residue, which mimics the negative charge state of a phosphorylated molecule (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Egelhoff et al., 1993</xref>). We also constructed two truncation mutants, one lacking the entire conserved domain (<italic>ΔC1</italic>) and a second one lacking the less conserved, charged region toward the C terminus (<italic>ΔC2</italic>).</p>
        <p>Gel shift and exonuclease assays were performed using uniformly labeled in vitro transcribed mRNA and bacterially expressed versions of each mutant (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S6</xref>B and S6C). RNA binding was not affected in <italic>D32A</italic> or <italic>D38A</italic> mutants, and these residues are thus unlikely to facilitate binding to the RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Ca, lanes 3 and 5). Interestingly, while exonuclease activity was also not disrupted in the alanine conversion mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Cb, lanes 3 and 5), both aspartic acid to arginine conversions (<italic>D32R</italic> or <italic>D38R</italic>) resulted in a loss of exonucleolytic activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Cb, lanes 4 and 6), while RNA binding was still observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Ca, lanes 4 and 6). The loss of activity could be due to disruption of charge-based interactions between the aspartic acid and nucleobases. An interesting effect was observed in mutants of T41; exonuclease activity, but not RNA binding, was reduced after a conversion to alanine (<italic>T41A</italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>Cb, lane 7, and 5Ca, lane 7). Conversion to aspartic acid (<italic>T41D</italic>), however, mimicking a potential phosphorylated molecule, abolished both exonuclease activity and RNA binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>Ca and 5Cb, lane 8), suggesting that T41 is indeed important for the catalytic activity of Rrp17p and might be regulated by phosphorylation. Strong inhibition of both RNA binding and exonuclease activity was also observed in <italic>F43A</italic> and <italic>R70A</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>Ca and 5Cb, lanes 9 and 11), but not <italic>R46A</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figured 5</xref>Ca and 5Cb, lane 10), indicating that residues 43 and 70 are most likely part of the catalytic and RNA-binding domain. The removal of the conserved domain (<italic>ΔC1</italic>) had only a minor effect on RNA-binding efficiency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Ca, lane 13), but no exonuclease activity was observed in these mutants; deletion of the C-terminal domain (<italic>ΔC2</italic>), however, did not affect catalytic activity but decreased RNA binding to the substrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>Ca and 5Cb, lane 12). Thus, both C1 and C2 contain RNA-binding activity, but only C1 contains catalytic activity.</p>
        <p>To define the importance of the conserved C1 domain in cell growth, the mutated <italic>rrp17</italic> ORFs were tested for their ability to rescue an <italic>RRP17</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Da). All the mutant proteins were stably expressed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S6</xref>D and S6E), and all alleles, except <italic>ΔC1</italic>, were viable at 23°C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Da). However, viability of the mutants, but not wild-type or a strain expressing wild-type RRP17, was greatly reduced at 37°C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Dc), while <italic>T41A</italic> and <italic>R70A</italic> already exhibited reduced viability at 30°C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>Db). These data support our in vitro analysis of Rrp17p mutants; moreover, the strong phenotype associated with the T41 mutant, deficient in catalytic activity but not RNA binding, emphasizes the likely importance of Rrp17p exonuclease activity in vivo.</p>

        <title>Functional Links between Late Processing and Export of Pre-60S Ribosomal Subunits</title>
        <p>Rrp17p-associated complexes not only contained pre-60S subunit components, but also NPC components and proteins known to chaperone preribosomes through the NPC into the cytoplasm. We therefore assessed whether export of preribosomes was affected by depletion of Rrp17p. The localization of pre-60S subunits was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe complementary to the 5′ end of ITS2 (a region present in 35S, 32S, 27S, and 7S pre-rRNAs) (<xref rid="bib29 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Léger-Silvestre et al., 2004; Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). In both the wild-type and the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> cells grown under permissive conditions (T = 0), the ITS2-containing pre-rRNAs were concentrated in the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Following growth in glucose medium for 12 hr, in &gt;90% of cells, the signal was found to accumulate throughout the nucleoplasm in Rrp17-depleted but not wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), where it was still localized to the nucleolus. The localization of pre-40S subunits was determined in the same cells by using a probe complementary to the 5′ end of ITS1 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Moy and Silver, 1999</xref>). No difference in localization of ITS1 signal was seen in Rrp17p-depleted cells compared to wild-type after 12 hr in glucose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, depletion of Rrp17p hinders the export of 60S ribosomal subunits, but not 40S subunits.</p>
        <p>To further investigate a potential link between late processing of rRNA and ribosomal export, we also assessed export of preribosomal subunits in the absence of Rat1p and Xrn1p. In <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> cells grown under permissive conditions (T = 0), the ITS2-containing pre-rRNAs were concentrated in the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). However, similar to Rrp17p-depleted cells, following growth under restrictive conditions for 12 hr, the ITS2 signal was found to accumulate throughout the nucleoplasm, although to a much lesser extent (&gt;85%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). No nuclear accumulation of ITS1 signal was seen in <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> cells, indicating that pre-40S export was not affected in those cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The deletion of Xrn1p, however, resulted in an accumulation of excised D-A<sub>2</sub> RNA in the cytoplasm, as the protein is responsible for degradation of this fragment (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Moy and Silver, 1999</xref>). Export of pre-60S ribosomal subunits was also disrupted in <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) and <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1</italic> cells (&gt;90%) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>B). Taken together, these data show that defects in 5′ maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs hinder pre-60S subunit export and, moreover, point toward a link between late processing of rRNA and ribosomal export. To determine whether this phenomenon is specifically true for 5′ maturation of pre-60S components or extends to late maturation steps in general, localization of ITS2-containing pre-rRNAs was determined in the absence of Rai1p, the cofactor to Rat1p, and Rrp6p, a 3′–5′ exonuclease required for 3′ maturation of 5.8S rRNA (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>C). ITS2 was found to accumulate throughout the nucleoplasm in the absence of either protein (&gt;90%), while localization of ITS1 and thus export of pre-40S subunits did not seem affected (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S7</xref>C). This points strongly to a coupling between both late 5′ and 3′ maturation events of pre-60S RNA components and pre-60S subunit export.</p>
        <p>If indeed there is a direct functional link between late processing and nuclear export of pre-60S ribosomal subunits, then one might expect that disruption of nuclear transport might cause a redistribution of proteins specifically involved in late 60S processing, of which Rrp17p would be a prominent example. Indeed, we find such a redistribution. Both Rrp17p and another late processing factor, Noc3p (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Milkereit et al., 2001</xref>), redistribute (in &gt;95% of cells) upon exposure to a metabolic poison cocktail that is known to reversibly arrest nuclear transport (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A, 7B, 7E, and 7F) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shulga et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, both proteins accumulate at the nuclear periphery, consistent with their biochemical association with the NPC and nuclear peripheral components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). By contrast, the early ribosomal processing factor Noc1p (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Milkereit et al., 2001</xref>), did not redistribute under these conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C and 7D), underscoring the specificity of this result. It seems unlikely that Rrp17p is involved in the transport of ribosomes, as its redistribution in poison resembles that of Noc3p but not of Rrp12p (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Oeffinger et al., 2004</xref>), a shuttling factor known to facilitate ribosome export, which becomes more cytoplasmic upon metabolic arrest (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>G and 7H). The control protein Dbp5p (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Strahm et al., 1999</xref>), an mRNA helicase localized to the NPC and cytoplasm, does not redistribute in these conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>I and 7J).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We show here that Rrp17p is a previously unknown 5′–3′ exonuclease, which we identified in proteomic studies of preribosomal complexes where it is present in intermediate to late pre-60S subunits and associates with precursors to 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. Rrp17p is an essential protein that binds late pre-60S ribosomes and is required for efficient exonuclease digestion to the mature 5′ ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S RNAs. Moreover, it accompanies the 60S subunit from the nucleolus to the nuclear periphery and even to the NPC. With a putative catalytic domain close to its N terminus, Rp17p is highly conserved among fungi and higher eukaryotes, though it lacks homology to other known nucleases. The human homolog, Nol12, was able to replace Rrp17p in vivo, confirming the functional conservation of this protein family.</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Is Required for the Efficient Formation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA and 25S rRNA</title>
        <p>The 5′–3′ exonuclease Rat1p was previously implicated as the key player in the 5′ maturation of rRNAs in yeast. However, Rat1p has a homolog, Xrn1p; in the absence of Rat1p, it has been suggested that Xrn1p substitutes for Rat1p's function (<xref rid="bib10 bib21 bib25" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Geerlings et al., 2000; Johnson, 1997</xref>). The characterization of Rrp17p reveals that, similar to 3′ end processing of 5.8S rRNA, 5′ end maturation also involves multiple nucleases. The presence of another nuclear 5′–3′ exonuclease provides the cell with redundant pathways to ensure robust and efficient production of 60S ribosomal subunits. Interestingly, using in vitro transcribed pre-RNA substrates starting from either cleavage sites at A<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>, degradation did not occur for the same number of nucleotides for the two substrates (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>G and S7H). Instead, processing was stopped at different distances from the 5′ end in each case, suggesting that the enzyme is most likely stopped by either secondary structure or nonpreferred sequence. The latter is known to exist for Rat1p, which is inhibited by poly-G-rich sequences (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Poole and Stevens, 1997</xref>). This suggests that, although able to degrade ITS regions on their own, each exonuclease is likely to have preferred substrate regions within ITS1 and 2, underlining the potential gain in efficiency provided by another exonuclease and a shared role during 5′ end pre-rRNA maturation. We therefore speculate that both Rrp17p and Rat1p associate with each pre-rRNA substrate during processing to orchestrate the maturation process.</p>
        <p>Rai1p, the <italic>Ra</italic>t1p-<italic>i</italic>nteracting protein, has been reported to enhance the activity of Rat1p (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2000</xref>). Deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> leads to a discernable shift in the 5.8S<sub>S</sub> to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> ratio, which is complete in the absence of Rat1p, an effect that is not seen in <italic>rrp17/rai1</italic> mutants, where deletion of Rai1p results only in a mild exacerbation of the 5′ end processing defect. Moreover, a direct interaction was shown for Rat1p and Rai1p in vitro, and Rai1p relocalizes to the cytoplasm in <italic>rat1</italic> mutants, making it unlikely that Rai1p also functions as a cofactor for Rrp17p (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sydorskyy et al., 2003</xref>). However, the association of Rai1p with pre-rRNA may be required for conformational changes within ITS1 that allow efficient exonucleolytic processing by both nucleases, which could explain the increase in endonucleolytic processing and shift in 5.8S<sub>S</sub> to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> ratio in <italic>rai1Δ</italic> cells.</p>
        <p>Very little is known about whether processing within the two ITS regions is coordinated; however, it has been observed that defective processing in ITS1 can lead to either premature or less-efficient processing in ITS2 (<xref rid="bib7 bib12 bib18 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Côté et al., 2002; Eppens et al., 2002; Fatica et al., 2002; Shuai and Warner, 1991</xref>). In the absence of an efficient exonucleolytic 5′ end processing pathway, a gradual shift to endonucleolytic 5′ end maturation of 5.8S rRNA and increase in 5.8S<sub>L</sub> occurs. In agreement with previous studies, the concomitant accumulation of ITS2-containing precursors (27SB, 26S, and 7S) suggests a linkage between the processing of both spacers. Specifically, the appearance of 3′-extended 5.8S precursor RNAs in both Rrp17p- and Rat1p-depleted strains implies a connection between 5′ and 3′ end maturation of 5.8S rRNA (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, in the past, it has been suggested that Rai1p may coordinate the 5′ end and 3′ end processing activities of Rat1p and the nuclear exosome, as deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> strongly accumulated 3′-extended precursors of 5.8S rRNA and was synthetically lethal when combined with a deletion of the exosome component <italic>RRP6</italic> (<xref rid="bib10 bib16" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

        <title>The Association of Rrp17p with the Nuclear Periphery</title>
        <p>Biochemical, functional, and localization evidence all agree that Rrp17p can be associated with the nuclear periphery and the NPC. Upon immunoisolation, 13 nucleoporins, nuclear peripheral proteins (such as the Mlp proteins), and nuclear transport factors copurify with tagged Rrp17p. This provides strong evidence for a close physical connection between Rrp17p and regions on and immediately surrounding the NPC's nuclear face. We also show that Rrp17p partially colocalizes with the nuclear periphery in vivo and that this localization is significantly and specifically enhanced by conditions that disrupt nuclear transport. A functional connection between Rrp17p's role in late ribosomal processing and nuclear export is shown by the inhibition of late pre-60S export upon depletion of Rrp17p. It is formally possible that the pool of Rrp17p associated with the NPC is not the same as the pool involved in late 60S processing; however, taken together, the most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that Rrp17p accompanies the late 60S subunit to the nuclear periphery and NPC and that correct processing is a prerequisite for export of the subunit through the NPC. Indeed, we provide evidence that there may be a general physical and functional link between late processing of 60S subunits and export, as the latter is not only delayed in Rrp17p-depleted cells but also in strains carrying mutants of Rat1p, Xrn1p, Rai1p, or Rrp6p—all components of the late 5′ and 3′ processing machinery. Such a link would not be altogether surprising, as a similar mechanism has been identified for the late mRNA processing and proofreading machinery, which associates with the nuclear periphery and NPC (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carmody and Wente, 2009</xref>).</p>

        <title>Rrp17p Is Part of a Family of Conserved Eukaryotic Exonucleases</title>
        <p>Rrp17p is just one member of a conserved family of putative RNA exonucleases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Although the rat homolog of Rrp17p, Nop25, has previously been characterized in COS7 cells as a nucleolar RNA-binding protein involved in ribosome synthesis, no functional data were shown at the time (<xref rid="bib20 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Fujiwara et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>). The ability of Nol12 to rescue a <italic>RRP17</italic> deletion, however, denotes the protein not only as a sequence but also as a functional homolog of Rrp17p, and it will be interesting to determine if Nol12 fulfills a similar role during rRNA processing in higher eukaryotes to Rrp17p. So far, we are only slowly unraveling the mechanism of ribosome maturation in higher eukaryotes, due to its even greater complexity. The characterization of Nol12 will therefore provide us with useful insight into ribosome biogenesis in mammalian cells. Moreover, given the multifunctional nature of Xrn2/Rat1p as an exonuclease in mRNA degradation as well as rRNA processing (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), it will be interesting to see if the sole function of Nol12 and Rrp17p lies in rRNA maturation or if the protein has additional roles in degradation of other RNA species.</p>
