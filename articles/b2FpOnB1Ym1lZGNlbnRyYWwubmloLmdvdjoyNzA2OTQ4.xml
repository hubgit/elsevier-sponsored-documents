        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The transcription factor STAT1 plays a role in promoting apoptotic cell death, whereas the related STAT3 transcription factor protects cardiac myocytes from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury or oxidative stress. Cytokines belonging to the IL-6 family activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway, but also activate other cytoprotective pathways such as the MAPK-ERK or the PI3-AKT pathway. It is therefore unclear whether STAT3 is the only cytoprotective mediator against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Overexpression of STAT3 in primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) protects against I/R-induced cell death. Moreover, a dominant negative STAT3 adenovirus (Ad ST3-DN) enhanced apoptotic cell death (81.2 ± 6.9%) compared to control infected NRVM (46.0 ± 3.1%) following I/R. Depletion of STAT3 sensitized cells to apoptotic cell death following oxidative stress. These results provide direct evidence for the role of STAT3 as a cytoprotective transcription factor in cells exposed to oxidative stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Apoptosis has become increasingly recognized as one mechanism of cell death during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in cultured cardiac myocytes and in the isolated intact heart <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1–3]</xref>. While research into the underlying molecular mechanisms of I/R remains challenging there is great potential to uncover candidate targets for novel therapeutic intervention through elucidation of the precise signalling cascades that control cell fate following cardiac damage. One of the pathways which is instrumental in determining cell fate following the oxidative stress which occurs during I/R is the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factor pathway <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>STAT activation is initiated following ligand binding to the extracellular domain of JAK receptors and autophosphorylation of the JAK cytoplasmic domain, creating a docking site for the SH2 domain of STATs <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This association causes JAKs to phosphorylate STATs at distinct tyrosine residues, allowing the bound STATs to be released from the receptor and undergo homo- or heterodimersation <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Phosphorylated STATs are then translocated to the nucleus where they bind specific sequences in the promoters of target genes leading to transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have shown that STATs can modulate the apoptotic programme in a variety of cell types <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, STAT1 deficient cells are resistant to tumour necrosis factor α-induced apoptotic cell death <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. STAT1 also has tumour suppressor properties and is required to modulate cell cycle checkpoint response following DNA damage <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. STAT1 can also function as a co-activator and modulate the transcriptional activity of p53 and p73 <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. We have previously reported that overexpression of STAT1 enhances apoptotic cell death in cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated I/R <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. In contrast to STAT1, the related STAT3 transcription factor has oncogenic properties and is overexpressed in many cancers <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have described cytoprotective actions of STAT3 activity following cytokine stimulation in cardiac cells exposed to I/R <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have confirmed that hearts from transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active STAT3 are protected from I/R injury <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. STAT3 is also required for ischaemic preconditioning in the brain <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and liver <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as well as in the heart <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many of the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of STAT3 relied on cytokines that activated the JAK-STAT3 pathway. However, these cytokines are also known to activate other cytoprotective pathways such as the MAPK-ERK and the PI3-AKT pathways. In the present study we examined whether genetically depleting STAT3 in the absence of cytokine stimulation compromises cytoprotection.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of wild type STAT3 protects against cell death in cardiac myocytes exposed to I/R whereas, a STAT3Y705F mutant enhances I/R-induced cell death</title>
        <p>To determine whether STAT3 has a direct role in modulating the levels of cell death, we carried out transient transfection experiments in primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) exposed to I/R injury. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A transient expression of wild type STAT3 significantly reduced the levels of apoptotic cell death from 50 ± 5% to 31 ± 7% in NRVM exposed to I/R. This suggests that STAT3 may indeed function as a cytoprotective factor in cells subjected to oxidative stress. In order to show and confirm that transfection and overexpression of STAT3 allows it to mediate its transcriptional activity we also carried out reporter luciferase assays using two well characterised STAT3 target promoters, p21 and Ly6E <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. In both cases transient expression of STAT3 induced a 3-fold increase of p21 and Ly6E promoter activity in NRVM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), thus confirming that STAT3 is transcriptionally active when overexpressed in NRVM.</p>
        <p>To further clarify the role of STAT3 in NRVM following I/R injury, we utilized a mutant STAT3 adenovirus in which the tyrosine (Y705) was mutated to a phenylalanine (F705). This mutant has been shown to act as a dominant negative (ST3-DN) <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Importantly, this approach using an adenoviral STAT3<sup>Y705F</sup> allows us to transduce &gt; 90% of NRVM and as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, ST3-DN enhanced significantly the effects of I/R-induced death to 81.2 ± 6.9% compared with control (GFP) infected cells 46.0 ± 3.1%. This data provides further evidence that a fully transcriptionally active STAT3 that requiring the 705 tyrosine phosphorylation site is necessary for its cytoprotective properties.</p>

        <title>Deletion of STAT3 sensitizes cells to cell death</title>
        <p>While overexpression using a variety of methods is useful to examine the effects of factors on cell fate, it may lead to spurious results due to the non-physiological levels produced using such protocols. Since STAT3 deficient mice are not viable <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we therefore, utilized STAT3 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to further examine the role of STAT3 in MEF cells exposed to I/R injury. Interestingly, as indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, STAT3 deficient MEF cells were very sensitive to I/R injury compared to wild type MEF cells with very few STAT3 deficient MEFs (ST3−/−) remaining attached to the culture dishes following 4 h of simulated ischaemia and 16 h of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A lower panel). We therefore, reduced the simulated ischaemic period from 4 h to 2 h and the simulated reperfusion period from 16 h to 1 h and once again as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, there was significantly enhanced cell death in the ST3−/− MEF compared to wild type MEF ST3+/+ cells. Since MEF cells are not usually exposed physiologically to I/R we instead subjected MEF cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a model of oxidative stress. Once again, ST3−/− cells were significantly more sensitive to cell death than ST3+/+ MEF cells in a dose and time dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D). These data are further evidence that STAT3 deficiency renders cells more susceptible to oxidative stress.</p>

        <title>Activated STAT3 is induced following I/R</title>
        <p>The above data demonstrates that exogenous levels of STAT3 are cytoprotective in cardiac myocytes exposed to I/R injury. However, it is unclear whether endogenous STAT3, phospho-pSTAT3<sup>Y705</sup> or pSTAT3<sup>S727</sup> is activated in NRVM during I/R. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, pSTAT3<sup>Y705</sup> levels increased following 4 h of ischaemia peaked at 1 h of reperfusion. The levels of pSTAT3<sup>Y705</sup> remained elevated even after 20 h of reperfusion compared to control resting cells. The levels of pSTAT3<sup>S727</sup> also increased following 4 h of ischaemia and again peaked at the 1 h reperfusion time point, but unlike pSTAT3<sup>Y705</sup>, pSTAT3<sup>S727</sup> returned to control levels thereafter. As previously reported in the isolated intact heart <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, STAT1 phosphorylation of pSTAT1<sup>Y701</sup> was also enhanced during ischaemia and remained elevated 20 h after reperfusion in NRVM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) and this was also associated with increased apoptotic activity as assessed by the processing and cleavage of procaspase-9. In contrast, pSTAT1<sup>S727</sup> was increased during ischaemia, but decreased over time following reperfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>To confirm that endogenous STAT3 activity was enhanced following I/R, we carried out our Ly6E STAT3 responsive reporter assay and showed that there was a significant increase (40-fold) in Ly6E promoter activity in NRVM cells exposed to I/R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Furthermore we also demonstrate that two well known STAT3 responsive genes SOCS3 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and c-Fos <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> were also upregulated in NRVM cells exposed to I/R as assessed by qPCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). As a positive control we also transduced NRVM with a constitutively active STAT3 adenovirus (Ad-STAT3C) <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and showed that enhanced levels of STAT3 activity was also associated with upregulation of SOCS3 and c-Fos mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E). Taken together, these data strongly suggests that endogenous STAT3 does indeed become activated and induces a transcriptional programme that may modulate the levels of I/R-cell death in cardiac cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Myocardial infarction or I/R injury results from occlusion of blood flow in the left ventricle via the coronary arteries, leading to cardiac damage, cell death and eventually loss of cardiac output. The molecular mechanism that mediates myocardial damage following I/R are not fully understood. STAT transcription factors have been reported to play a prominent role in cell fate following various stresses including I/R <xref rid="bib5 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[5,10,11]</xref>. Our present <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrates that STAT3 plays a cytoprotective role in cardiac cells exposed to I/R injury and oxidative stress and that depleting STAT3 in the absence of cytokine stimulation compromises cytoprotection.</p>
      <p>Recently we showed that the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 are significantly modulated in the infarcted area in the <italic>in vivo</italic> rat myocardium exposed to I/R injury <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, the free radical scavenger tempol reduced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced the infarct size following I/R <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, suggesting that activation of STAT1 and STAT3 within the infarct area may contribute to cardiac remodelling. Also free radical production following I/R injury may be a trigger for distinct kinases that are responsible for STAT1 or SATAT3 phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>STAT1 overexpression has been shown to induce apoptosis in cardiac myocytes after I/R injury <italic>in vitro</italic>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies also showed both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation is enhanced but with different time kinetics <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although it was observed that there was less overall activated STAT3 in the infarcted heart, it may still counteract the effects of activated STAT1 and reduce the degree of damage. This was further highlighted following IFN-γ treatment, a potent activator of STAT1, which exacerbated cardiac damage as evidenced by increased infarct size <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation during reperfusion and significantly reduced the cardioprotective effect of tempol, indicating that this antioxidant’s anti-apoptotic effect is likely to be mediated partly through reduction in activated STAT1 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Since we previously showed that the cardioprotective affects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant found in green tea, were partly mediated by inhibition of STAT1 activity <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, this highlights the role of STAT1 as a general molecular target for antioxidants in the ischemic myocardium.</p>
      <p>Although total STAT3 deletion is embryonic lethal, these mice had developmental heart defects also suggesting an important role for STAT3 in cardiac development <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Generation of cardiac-specific STAT3 knock outs further highlighted the important role of STAT3 in the heart. These mice suffer from decreased left ventricular capillary density and showed symptoms of heart failure <xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. Furthermore these mice were more susceptible to I/R-induced cardiac damage and had larger infarct sizes and increased myocyte apoptotic cell death <xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been reported to confer cardioprotection, reduced infarct size and inhibited apoptotic cell death. These effects of G-CSF were abolished by in mice expressing an inactive STAT3 in cardiac myocytes, suggesting that the cardioptotective effects are mediated via G-CSF-JAK-STAT3 pathway <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, these data are further evidence that STAT3 has cytoprotective properties and in particular highlight a role for STAT3 in cardioprotection.</p>

        <p>STAT3 protects cardiac myocytes from I/R injury. (A) Cardiac myocytes were transfected with 0.5 μg GFP and 0.25 μg STAT3-pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 empty vector for 48 h and subjected to I/R injury for the indicated times. Cell death was measured using TUNEL, a minimum of 200 GFP positive cells were counted per experiment.

        <p>Activation of STAT3 following I/R injury. NRVMs were subjected to 4 h ischaemia or ischaemia plus the indicated times of reperfusion and lysates were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies for (A) tyrosine and serine phosphorylated STAT3 or (B) tyrosine and serine phosphorylated STAT1 and caspase-9. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (C) STAT3 dependent luciferase reporter activity is enhanced by I/R injury. 1 μg of Ly6E luciferase reporter and 0.1 μg CMV-renilla were transfected into NRVMs in 6-well plates for 24 h. Cells were then subjected to 4 h ischaemia and 24 h reperfusion (I/R) and luciferase activity was measured <sup>∗∗∗</sup><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 3, experiment repeated in duplicate. (D) STAT3 dependent gene expression is increased by I/R injury. NRVMs were subjected to a time course of I/R injury and the levels of SOCS3 and c-Fos were measured by qPCR and normalised to control (con) levels. Isc = Ischaemia alone without reperfusion.
