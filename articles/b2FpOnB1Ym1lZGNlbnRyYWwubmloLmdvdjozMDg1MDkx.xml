          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cellular adhesion mediated by cardiac desmosomes is a prerequisite for proper electric propagation mediated by gap junctions in the myocardium. However, the molecular principles underlying this interdependence are not fully understood.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>The purpose of this study was to determine potential causes of right ventricular conduction abnormalities in a patient with borderline diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>To assess molecular changes, the patient's myocardial tissue was analyzed for altered desmosomal and gap junction (connexin43) protein levels and localization. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional studies were performed to characterize the consequences of the desmosomal mutations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Loss of plakoglobin signal was evident at the cell junctions despite expression of the protein at control levels. Although the distribution of connexin43 was not altered, total protein levels were reduced and changes in phosphorylation were observed. The truncation mutant in desmocollin-2a is deficient in binding plakoglobin. Moreover, the ability of desmocollin-2a to directly interact with connexin43 was abolished by the mutation. No pathogenic potential of the desmoglein-2 missense change was identified.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The observed abnormalities in gap junction protein expression and phosphorylation, which precede an overt cardiac phenotype, likely are responsible for slow myocardial conduction in this patient. At the molecular level, altered binding properties of the desmocollin-2a mutant may contribute to the changes in connexin43. In particular, the newly identified interaction between the desmocollin-2a isoform and connexin43 provides novel insights into the molecular link between desmosomes and gap junctions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Desmosomes provide a rigid link between neighboring cells, which allows them to withstand mechanical strain. In these structures, the extracellular portions of desmosomal cadherins mediate cell adhesion across the cell borders, while their intracellular modules bind to the plaque proteins plakoglobin (PG) and plakophilin, which in turn bind desmoplakin (DSP).<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> The latter is associated with intermediate filaments, which establish a mechanical continuum across cells.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The importance of this mechanical integrity is underlined by human disease manifestations. Mutations in desmosomal genes can result in cardiac disease, including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), cutaneous disorders (palmoplantar keratoderma), and multitissue syndromes (e.g., Naxos disease).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In cardiac desmosomes, two desmosomal cadherins are expressed: desmocollin-2 (DSC2) and desmoglein-2 (DSG2).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Both have overlapping functions in binding PG and plakophilin-2 (PKP2), believed to be mediated by a conserved region in their cytoplasmic portion, the intracellular cadherin segment (ICS).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Desmocollins are characterized by two splice variants (a form and b form) with different cytoplasmic portions.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The DSC2a protein contains the full ICS domain, whereas this module is significantly truncated in the DSC2b isoform. The ratio of isoforms appears to be controlled in a tissue-specific manner,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> suggesting an important regulatory role for tissue integrity.</p>
      <p>Desmosomal adhesion is a prerequisite for proper gap junction formation and maintenance at cell–cell contact sites.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Connexin43 (Cx43) is the major ventricular gap junction protein, which ensures electrical coupling of neighboring cardiomyocytes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In cardiac disease, changes of Cx43 localization are often observed.<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10–13</sup></xref> This phenomenon has been demonstrated in ARVC patients bearing <italic>PKP2</italic> mutations.<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> The pathologic process of gap junction remodeling is thought to contribute to a high risk for arrhythmias characterizing the condition.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, the molecular mechanisms of the impaired link between desmosomal function and gap junction remodeling are not fully understood.</p>
      <p>We present the case of a patient with slow right ventricular (RV) conduction in the presence of a truncation mutation in <italic>DSC2</italic> and a missense variant in <italic>DSG2</italic>. Analysis of endomyocardial tissue from this patient revealed that molecular changes in protein expression and phosphorylation may precede an overt ARVC phenotype. Moreover, our functional studies on the mutant DSC2 protein shed light on how the DSC2a isoform may contribute to desmosome and gap junction interdependence by providing a direct binding interface for Cx43.</p>

        <title>Identification of a DSC2 mutation in a patient with RV conduction abnormalities</title>
        <p>A 52-year-old woman presented with palpitations and a family history of sudden cardiac death (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). Her resting ECG showed sinus rhythm, PR interval of 190 ms, QRS duration of 84 ms, and prolongation of the terminal S wave (&gt;55 ms) in lead V<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S2A</xref>). The signal-averaged ECG was negative for late potentials. Noncontact mapping of the RV demonstrated moderately prolonged total RV endocardial activation time of 82 ms in sinus rhythm versus &lt;65 ms recorded in healthy controls.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Furthermore, the maximum endocardial activation gradient was only 0.22 mm/ms, which is 40% of that recorded in healthy controls by our group using this technique (0.51 ± 0.15 mm/ms).<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Fractionated and low-amplitude electrograms also were identified in the posterior RV wall and posterolateral RV outflow tract segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although the patient did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for ARVC (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), clear evidence of slow conduction and fragmented electrograms was seen in the patient's RV, and this feature is compatible with a subclinical ARVC phenotype.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> These sites of electrogram fractionation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) indicated that local conduction heterogeneities were present that could promote conduction block and reentry leading to ventricular arrhythmia. ARVC mutation screening was performed, and two mutations were identified:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1</label><p>A heterozygous deletion was found in exon 16 of <italic>DSC2</italic> (c. 2553 delA). This frameshift mutation is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon at position 855, truncating the last 47 amino acids of the <italic>DSC2</italic>a isoform (<italic>DSC2</italic> Q851fsX855, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).</p></list-item><list-item><label>2</label><p>A heterozygous nucleotide change was identified in exon 11 of <italic>DSG2</italic> (c. 1550 C&gt;T), resulting in an alanine to valine change at amino acid position 517 (<italic>DSG2</italic> A517V). None of the changes was found in 450 controls.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>The 18-year-old daughter of the index patient was also positive for both sequence changes (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). Clinical evaluation showed T-wave inversion in leads V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> on the ECG (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S2B</xref>). However, the patient had no other diagnostic features suggestive of ARVC. Like her mother, she had a borderline diagnosis of ARVC (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Family evaluation revealed that the sudden cardiac death in the family was unrelated to desmosomal mutations (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec3.2">
        <title>Changes in myocardium in the presence of desmosomal mutations</title>
        <p>Endomyocardial biopsy of the patient showed evidence of interstitial and replacement fibrosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore, the immunoreactive signal for PG was severely depressed at the cardiac intercalated disks, whereas the adherens junction protein N-cadherin was clearly present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). These observations are in agreement with molecular changes occurring in the myocardium of ARVC patients.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Western blotting for desmosomal components showed minimal reduction of both DSC2 and DSG2 expression levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Because the truncated DSC2a protein has electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the DSC2b form, no quantitative information about isoform ratios (DSC2a/DSC2b) could be made. Other desmosomal proteins (including PG) and desmin were at control levels. The total protein content of the gap junction protein Cx43 was mildly reduced in the patient's sample (by approximately 20%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C), whereas the band appeared to be migrating differently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). High-resolution analysis identified two different Cx43 bands for the control sample and one major band for Cx43 in the patient sample (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This band had an even slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than the lower band of the control sample, which is indicative of differences in Cx43 phosphorylation.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The gap junction–associated protein ZO-1 was also found to be slightly reduced.</p>
        <p>Immunofluorescence analysis of Cx43 in the endomyocardial biopsy sample showed a normal localization pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). Collectively, analysis of the patient's myocardial tissue suggested that the desmosomal mutations may reduce Cx43 protein levels and phosphorylation but not overall distribution.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec3.3">
        <title>Localization studies of DSC2 and DSG2 mutations</title>
        <p>Normal localization of the mutant DSC2 and DSG2 proteins was observed at the desmosomes of the cardiac cell line HL-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">S4C</xref>). Moreover, the mutant proteins were targeted to the intercalated disks of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, where they co-localized with the desmosomal proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">S4D</xref>). Hence, any pathogenic action of the mutant proteins would arise from altered protein function (e.g., binding properties) at the cardiac desmosomes. Altered binding properties for the DSG2 A517V change were not identified (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional consequences of the truncated cytoplasmic domain in DSC2a</title>
        <p>The mutation in exon 16 of <italic>DSC2</italic> is predicted to have no direct consequences for the DSC2b splice variant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast, a large portion of the conserved ICS in the DSC2a isoform is predicted to be truncated by the mutation. Because the ICS is thought to mediate binding to other desmosomal components, binding of the DSC2a mutant to the desmosomal plaque proteins PG and PKP2 was tested. In GST pulldown experiments, the cytoplasmic portion of DSC2a wild-type (WT) bound to both PG and PKP2 from rat heart lysate, whereas DSC2b bound only to PKP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). No binding of the mutant DSC2a protein to PG was observed, and binding to PKP2 was unaffected. Moreover, the mutant DSC2a did not bind to a DSP construct (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S5A</xref>). Using full-length DSC2a proteins in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the mutant form showed strongly reduced binding to PG compared with its WT counterpart (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). These experiments suggest that Q851fsX855 may interfere with intradesmosomal protein interactions. In agreement with the intracellular position of the truncation, binding to DSG2 (mediated by the extracellular portion) was preserved (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The observed changes in Cx43 total protein level and phosphorylation in the patient's myocardium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) suggested a link between Q851fsX855 and the gap junction protein. Accordingly, we examined the possibility of a direct interaction between DSC2a and Cx43. Indeed, the cytoplasmic portion of WT DSC2a was found to co-sediment with Cx43-YFP in GST pulldown assays, but no binding was observed between DSC2b and Cx43-YFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Moreover, DSC2a WT bound to endogenous Cx43, and again the mutant DSC2a protein and DSC2b did not bind (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The binding site within Cx43 was mapped to its cytoplasmic tail (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C), and only DSC2a WT bound to it, whereas no binding of either the mutated DSC2a protein or the DSC2b isoform was detected. Using full-length DSC2a WT and mutant protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, binding to endogenous Cx43 was confirmed for DSC2a WT, whereas no interaction was detectable between the mutant DSC2a and Cx43 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D).</p>
        <p>These results not only point toward a novel direct interaction between DSC2a and Cx43 but also indicate that the abolished interaction between the mutant DSC2a protein and Cx43 could contribute to the gap junction protein changes observed in the patient's myocardium.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Beyond mechanical adhesion, desmosomes have been implicated in signaling processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, and proliferation.<xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> In particular, a functional link between desmosomes and gap junctions has become evident through cardiac disease. In ARVC, mutations in genes coding for cardiac desmosomal proteins affect gap junction morphology<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and function,<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> and this pathologic situation is thought to contribute to the ventricular arrhythmias that characterize the disease. In Naxos disease, gap junction remodeling has been shown to possibly precede fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In this study, a patient who presented with delayed RV endocardial conduction and local fractionation of electrograms in the triangle of dysplasia was found to be a carrier of two desmosomal mutations. Despite the patient's benign phenotype, pathologic changes were evident at the molecular level. Immunoreactive signal for PG was remarkably reduced at the intercalated disks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This feature was found to characterize remodeling processes occurring in the myocardium of ARVC patients independent of the underlying gene mutation.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The observation that total PG levels were unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) supports the hypothesis that PG is redistributed to other cellular pools.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Moreover, changes in the main cardiac gap junction protein Cx43 were evident in the patient. Reduced Cx43 protein levels were detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), and, more importantly, a shift in electrophoretic mobility was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). In the patient's sample, faster migrating Cx43 was more prominent, suggesting a lower proportion of the highly phosphorylated protein.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The biologic relevance of this posttranslational modification at multiple sites in Cx43 is complex, as phosphorylation events are thought to regulate gap junction assembly, disassembly, and channel activity.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The slight reduction in gap junction protein ZO-1 indicates that the entire structure might be affected.</p>
      <p>A series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments performed provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that could underlie the observed changes. Functional studies on the <italic>DSG2</italic> A517V change failed to identify any pathogenic potential (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>). However, we cannot exclude completely that this conservative change contributes to the phenotype. The truncated DSC2a Q851fsX855 protein was also found to be normally incorporated into cardiac desmosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>); however, it completely abolished binding to PG and DSP, whereas binding to PKP2, which occurred in both DSC2 isoforms, was not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">S5</xref>). It is likely that the presence of the mutant DSC2a protein in the cardiac desmosomes reduces the capacity of these structures to retain PG, which could contribute to the observed redistribution of PG from junctional pools (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), as shown for other ARVC causing DSC2 mutations.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In particular, nuclear translocation of nonjunctional PG may aberrantly modulate Wnt signaling pathways, driving adipogenesis and fibrogenesis.<xref rid="bib25 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25,28</sup></xref> Due to the limited availability of patient material, we could not stain for other desmosomal proteins in our myocardial samples. Therefore, the assumption that PKP2 still is present at the intercalated disks is based solely on <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and is somewhat speculative.</p>
      <p>The truncation mutation in <italic>DSC2</italic> only affects the DSC2a isoform, whereas the DSC2b splice variant is not affected. A recent report suggested low expression levels of the DSC2a isoform in the heart and indicated that truncation of the last five amino acids of DSC2a by the A897fsX900 variant is not sufficient to cause ARVC<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> despite reduced binding to PG.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In contrast, in our patient with slow conduction and borderline diagnosis of ARVC, truncation of a substantial portion of the DSC2a ICS domain by the Q851fsX855 mutation causes complete loss of binding to PG and DSP. Moreover, our functional data shed new light on the unique cellular functions of the DSC2a splice isoform in cardiac tissue. Only this isoform (in its WT form), and not its DSC2b counterpart, provides a direct physical link to Cx43. Whereas the interaction is not affected by the A897fsX900 variant, the Q851fsX855 mutation abolishes this cellular function of DSC2a (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). This may, among many other factors,<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> contribute to the conduction abnormalities observed in the patient.</p>
      <p>Oxford et al<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> reported an interaction between desmosomal PKP2 and Cx43. However, the binding profiles of WT DSC2a and DSC2b do not suggest that the DSC2a Cx43 interaction is mediated by PKP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, PKP2 was not detectable in our immunocomplexes using a Cx43 antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). This discrepancy may be attributable to differences in experimental setups. Additionally, the multimolecular complex analyzed by Oxford et al might also have contained DSC2a or other bridging molecules. Nevertheless, the observation that knock-down of PKP2 affects Cx43 expression and localization as well as cell coupling properties supports our hypothesis that desmosomal proteins are essential for proper gap junction function. Down-regulation of PKP2 affected localization of DSP<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and, most likely, other desmosomal proteins, such as DSC2, as well. Hence, the lack of other desmosomal components at the intercalated disks, rather than the loss of PKP2 itself, could have triggered the redistribution and down-regulation of Cx43.</p>
      <p>Despite the observed molecular changes and evidence of significant reductions in both RV endocardial conduction time and activation gradient (a surrogate of conduction velocity), no ventricular arrhythmia was evident in the patient. A similar phenomenon of significantly high “conduction reserve” has been reported in animal models. Mice with a heterozygous deletion of Cx43 in the heart have no overt phenotype, and a reduction of Cx43 protein down to 10% of normal levels is required to induce spontaneous arrhythmias.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> These data indicate that reduced Cx43 expression contributes to an optimal milieu that facilitates arrhythmogenesis in ARVC. However, a specific physiologic trigger (e.g., increased adrenergic tone) promoting ventricular ectopy or further modulation of the substrate by inflammatory processes may be required to increase the probability of a clinically important arrhythmic event. These modulations in the substrate are expected to increase the heterogeneities in conduction and repolarization kinetics in the ventricle promoting conduction block, reentry, and the generation of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.</p>
      <p>Analysis of this patient with a subclinical ARVC phenotype provides valuable insight into disease mechanisms. Changes in gap junction protein Cx43 occur before any clinical manifestation significant enough to fulfill Task Force criteria for diagnosis but is, nevertheless, detectable utilizing high-density electrophysiologic mapping of the substrate. Moreover, the newly identified interaction between DSC2a and Cx43 may contribute to the interdependence of desmosomal integrity and gap junction function and thereby opens avenues for new therapeutic approaches in ARVC.</p>

The color scale represents timing of activation from onset of the QRS complex (red = early, purple = late). The total RV endocardial activation time was 82 ms, with latest site of activation in the posterior RV (site B). The electrograms in this area are fractionated compared to those in the anterior wall at site A. Similar fractionated electrograms were also identified in the posterolateral RV wall.</p>

        <p>Novel interaction between DSC2a and connexin43 (Cx43), which is abolished in the mutant DSC2a Q851fsX855 form. <bold>A:</bold> COS-1 cells coexpressing glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion proteins for the cytoplasmic region of DSC2a (wild-type [WT]) and DSC2b, together with Cx43 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein were subjected to GST pulldown assays. Cx43 bound to DSC2a but not to DSC2b. <bold>B:</bold> DSC2a WT, Q851fsX855 mutant, A897fsX900 variant, and DSC2b cytoplasmic region were fused to GST and expressed in COS-1 cells. Binding to endogenous Cx43 was observed with DSC2a WT but not for DSC2b. The mutation in DSC2a abolished binding to Cx43, whereas the A897fsX900 variant was functionally equivalent to WT. Lysate levels indicate that DSC2a predominantly binds the hypophosphorylated form of Cx43. <bold>C:</bold> Binding of Cx43 cytoplasmic tail (CT) to DSC2a WT, DSC2a mutant, and DSC2b protein in GST pulldown assays. Cx43 cytoplasmic tail was expressed as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in COS-1 cells and assayed for binding to bacterially expressed DSC2 cytoplasmic region GST fusion proteins (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Binding was only observed for DSC2a WT and not for the DSC2a mutant or DSC2b. There was no binding to GFP alone <bold>(second row). D:</bold> DSC2a mutant protein fails to bind Cx43 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Transfected full-length DSC2a WT and mutant were assayed for binding to endogenous Cx43, which was immunoprecipitated (where indicated, + in AB). Samples omitting the antibody served as negative controls. Endogenous plakophilin-2 (PKP2) was not detectable in immune complexes. The position of the marker bands is indicated on the right.
