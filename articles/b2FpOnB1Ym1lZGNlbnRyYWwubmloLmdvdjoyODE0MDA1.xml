        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that contain the α5 subunit (α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, and have been implicated in learning and memory processes. They generate a tonic form of inhibition that regulates neuronal excitability. Recently it was shown that α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs also contribute to slow phasic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons following local stimulation in the <italic>stratum lacunosum moleculare</italic>. However, it is unknown whether α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs can also be recruited indirectly by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Here, we studied GABAergic currents evoked by stimulation in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of CA1 in the presence and absence of CNQX to block AMPA receptor-mediated excitation. We tested their sensitivity to gabazine and two drugs acting at the benzodiazepine site of α1/α2/α3 or α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (400 nM zolpidem and 20 nM L-655,708, respectively). IPSCs evoked by stimulation in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> in the presence of CNQX were potentiated by zolpidem, blocked by 1 μM gabazine and were relatively insensitive to L-655,708 consistent with the lack of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. In contrast, IPSCs evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals had a significant gabazine-insensitive component. This component was attenuated by L-655,708 and enhanced by burst stimulation. Furthermore, the L-655,708-sensitive current was absent in recordings from mice lacking α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice). These results show that α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated phasic inhibition is activated by the Schaffer collateral pathway and provide evidence for activity pattern-dependent participation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in inhibition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Synaptic inhibition in the hippocampus plays a crucial role in balancing and synchronising the activity of excitatory cells. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) released by inhibitory interneurons activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), and in most mature neurons, GABA causes a reduction of the postsynaptic cell excitability via hyperpolarising and/or shunting inhibition (for review, see <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mann and Paulsen, 2007</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are Cl<sup>−</sup> permeable, pentameric ionic channels that are formed from the combination of distinct subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ɛ, θ, π, ρ1–3), and the majority of native combinations identified to date have a common 2:2:1 α/β/γ stoichiometry (reviewed in <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wafford, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The targeting of pyramidal cells by inhibitory interneurons follows a highly organised pattern, and the vast majority of GABAergic interneurons target either the perisomatic or specific dendritic domains of pyramidal cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). However, the role of specific GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes expressed in distinct CA1 pyramidal cell compartments is still poorly understood. There is some evidence of a high correlation between presynaptic interneuron type and their specific GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs subunit targets (<xref rid="bib24 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nusser et al., 1996; Thomson et al., 2000</xref>). For example, in the neocortex, recordings from synaptically-connected pairs between GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells have demonstrated that dendritic targeting inhibitory neurons preferentially activate α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, whereas those targeting the soma activate α1GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>By identifying the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes in different inhibitory pathways, it may be possible to pharmacologically target specific GABAergic networks in the hippocampus. Recent studies have started to dissect the contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs subtypes to different behaviours. Pharmacological tools in this area include the use of benzodiazepine derivatives or genetic modifications targeted at the benzodiazepine site, which is located at the interface of γ2 and α subunits (reviewed in <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wafford, 2005</xref>). By altering the kinetics of single GABA<sub>A</sub>R channels, benzodiazepines enhance the effect of GABA and a behavioural readout can be obtained to interpret the function of targeted α subunits. For example, mice with a point mutation in the α1GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit (His101Arg), which rendered it insensitive to diazepam, did not display the sedative and amnestic effects of benzodiazepines (<xref rid="bib21 bib30" ref-type="bibr">McKernan et al., 2000; Rudolph et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, inverse agonists acting at the benzodiazepine site (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tenen and Hirsch, 1980</xref>) inhibit the effect of GABA, and have effects opposite to those of the classical benzodiazepines. Using this approach, systemic application of the α3 inverse-agonist α3IA promoted anxiety-related behaviours in rodents (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Atack et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are of particular interest as they are highly expressed in the adult hippocampus both at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (<xref rid="bib33 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sperk et al., 1997; Sur et al., 1999</xref>), in stark contrast to low expression levels in other brain areas. Consistent with their hippocampal localisation, behavioural studies using α5 subunit-specific inverse agonists and α5 subunit knock out mice strongly implicated α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the modulation of learning and memory (<xref rid="bib12 bib3 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Collinson et al., 2002; Atack et al., 2006; Ballard et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are currently considered as relevant targets for memory blocking drugs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2009</xref>) and cognitive enhancing drugs with clinical applications such as in Alzheimer's disease patients, whose α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are well preserved (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Howell et al., 2000</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the regulation of hippocampal function by α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are not known.</p>
      <p>It is well established that extrasynaptic α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs can mediate a large component of tonic inhibition in the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib11 bib32 bib13 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Caraiscos et al., 2004; Scimemi et al., 2005; Glykys and Mody, 2006; Prenosil et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the role of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in phasic inhibition remains poorly understood. Studies comparing spontaneous and locally-evoked inhibition between mice lacking α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup>) and wild type (WT) mice suggested a negligible contribution of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to phasic inhibition (<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Collinson et al., 2002; Glykys and Mody, 2006</xref>). Other studies have suggested that α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs mediate a slowly decaying component of synaptic inhibition (GABA<sub>A,slow</sub>) (<xref rid="bib28 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Prenosil et al., 2006; Zarnowska et al., 2009</xref>). Evoked GABA<sub>A,slow</sub> potentials have only been observed following local extracellular stimulation at or near the <italic>stratum lacunosum moleculare</italic> (SLM) of the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib26 bib25 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pearce, 1993; Ouardouz and Lacaille, 1997; Zarnowska et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, GABA<sub>A,slow</sub> has been proposed to modulate the activity of distal dendrites in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and to mediate a component of synaptic inhibition activated by the direct input from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus at the SLM (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Banks et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs targeting cognitive enhancing drugs, it becomes important to establish whether in addition to their SLM activation, α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are recruited by CA3 output via Schaffer collateral activity. Local stimulation at the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> (SR) in CA1 has been reported to produce fast decaying IPSCs via perisomatic targeting inhibitory cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ouardouz and Lacaille, 1997</xref>) mediated by α1/α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Thomson et al., 2000</xref>). However, under conditions of local stimulation, excitatory synaptic transmission is usually blocked with glutamate receptor antagonists. Feed-forward inhibition requires activation of afferent fibres to interneurons which in turn release GABA onto pyramidal cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alger and Nicoll, 1982</xref>). The Schaffer collaterals are likely to stimulate directly or indirectly a wide variety of interneurons that would not be reached by local stimulation. In the present study, we compared locally-evoked and Schaffer collateral-stimulated inhibitory currents. To determine whether α5GAB<sub>A</sub>Rs contribute to the evoked IPSCs we used the inverse-agonist L-655,708 in rats and <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice. The results show that stimulation of Schaffer collaterals can activate a slowly decaying component of GABAergic inhibition, mediated by α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, particularly following bursts of high-frequency stimulation of Schaffer collateral afferent input.</p>

      <p>Animals were housed in groups with access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The holding facilities maintained a temperature of approximately 22 °C, humidity of 60–70%, and a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986, and the Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto.</p>

        <title>Tissue preparation</title>
        <p>Parasagittal slices containing the hippocampus were obtained from male Sprague Dawley rats (supplied by Harlan, Bicester, UK), or from <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>) and wild type (WT) littermates ranging from postnatal day 14 to 28. Rodents were anaesthetized with 5% isofluorane until breathing slowed down to approximately one breath per second, and stimulation of the limb withdrawal reflex no longer elicited a response. After decapitation, the brain was quickly removed into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), containing (in mM): NaCl, 126; KCl, 2.5; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25; glucose, 10, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, with a final pH of 7.2–7.4. Slices were prepared at 350 μm thickness using a Leica VT1000S microtome. Slices containing the hippocampal formation were trimmed from other brain regions and were maintained and recorded at room temperature (22–27 °C).</p>

        <title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
        <p>After transferring a single slice to a submerged-style recording chamber, a monopolar stainless steel stimulation electrode (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA) was placed into the SR of CA1 50–100 μm away from the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> (SP) for synaptic stimulation. Stimulation in the SR was carried out under two different conditions: firstly, to record GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, AMPA receptor-mediated excitation was blocked with CNQX while recording from a pyramidal cell. The stimulation electrode was placed approximately 100 μm lateral to the recorded cell to ensure stimulation of local interneurons. Secondly, to record inhibition elicited by the Schaffer collaterals (GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>) CNQX was not included. The stimulation electrode was placed approximately 300 μm lateral to the recorded cell to reduce local stimulation of GABAergic neurons in addition to afferent stimulation.</p>
        <p>Experiments were performed in voltage clamp mode. The intracellular solution contained (in mM): Gluconic acid 70; CsCl 10; NaCl 5; BAPTA free acid 10; Hepes 10; QX-314 10; GTP 0.3; Mg-ATP 4; pH was titrated to 7.25 ± 0.05 with CsOH. The estimated final Cs concentration for the intracellular solution was ∼120 mM. The final osmolarity was 280 ± 5 mOsmol l<sup>−1</sup>. BAPTA was used to prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent changes while measuring synaptic activity at depolarised membrane potentials. QX-314 blocks GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated currents in addition to Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nathan et al., 1990</xref>). All voltage values were corrected for the liquid junction potential measured as 13 mV.</p>
        <p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained with 2–4 MΩ borosilicate pipettes from putative CA1 pyramidal cells identified by their location in the SP and by their shape.</p>
        <p>The calculated E<sub>Cl</sub> at room temperature was −56 mV, and AMPA receptor-mediated currents reversed near 0 mV. For this reason GABAergic currents were recorded at 0 mV, both for local and Schaffer collateral stimulation, so as to isolate them from AMPA receptor-mediated currents in the latter case. For recordings at voltages other than −70 mV, a voltage step from −70 mV to the test potential started 5 s before synaptic stimulation. Whole-cell recordings were made using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA). Recordings were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitised at 20 kHz with a National Instruments A/D board (Austin, TX, USA) using Ginj 1.0 software (courtesy of Hugh P. C. Robinson) for acquisition from within Matlab (Mathworks Ltd, Natick, MA, USA). Postsynaptic currents were evoked using a stimulus isolator unit (ISO-flex, A.M.P.I. Jerusalem, Israel) which delivered pulses of 100 μs duration in current mode; stimulation intensities ranged between 20 μA and 70 μA and the computer-controlled stimulation interval was 60 s. Drugs were applied after a stable baseline of 6–10 min (&lt;10% drift allowed). Series resistance was not compensated during recordings. Series resistance was measured before each stimulation with a 5 mV, 50 ms step pulse. Recordings were terminated if series resistance (16 ± 6 MΩ) changed by more than 20%.</p>

        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>Data analysis was done using Matlab. Statistical testing was done using Matlab and SPSS software. Charge transfer was calculated by integrating the current responses from 5 to 750 ms following synaptic stimulation after leak subtraction (or 5–35 ms and 50–750 ms to separate early and late components in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ci). For comparison across experiments, synaptic peak current values or total charge transfer were normalised relative to the mean of baseline values obtained 5 min before drug application. For statistical comparison of drug effects, the average value of the last 4 min of recording was used. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and are displayed in two-minute bin intervals. <italic>N</italic> values refer to the number of slices recorded. Example traces are the average of 3–5 traces (Gaussian-filtered at a corner frequency of 2 kHz). Statistical significance was assessed using Student's two-sample two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, one-way ANOVA or repeated measures (RM) ANOVA, with Bonferroni post-hoc corrections for multiple comparisons where appropriate. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>20 μM <sc>dl</sc>-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid was used to block <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in all experiments. CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium) was used to block AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission for local stimulation of GABAergic interneurons. Gabazine (SR 95531 hydrobromide; 6-imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6<italic>H</italic>)-pyridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide) is a competitive antagonist at GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. L-655,708 (11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-9-oxo-9<italic>H</italic>-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylic acid, ethyl ester) is a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R; L-655,708 was initially dissolved to 10 mM in 1 N HCl, then diluted to 10 μM by adding H<sub>2</sub>O, and stored in frozen aliquots until used. Zolpidem (<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazol[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide) is a benzodiazepine acting primarily at α1GABA<sub>A</sub>R, and with some affinity for α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R at 400 nM. Zolpidem was dissolved at 100 mM in ethanol, frozen in aliquots, and diluted in aCSF just before use; equivalent amounts of ethanol were added in corresponding control experiments. All drugs described above were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).</p>

      <p>To measure synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices, single cells were voltage clamped and brief extracellular stimuli delivered in the SR. First, to activate local GABAergic currents (referred to as GABA<sub>A,local</sub>), AMPA receptor-mediated excitation was blocked using 10 μM CNQX. GABA<sub>A,local</sub> reversed close to E<sub>Cl</sub> at −54 ± 3 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 5; data not shown; for example traces see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ai) and was seen as an outward current at 0 mV. At this holding potential, IPSCs had a time constant of decay (<italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub>) of 163 ± 16 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 12).</p>
      <p>Next, IPSCs were elicited by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals. For these recordings, CNQX was omitted from the extracellular solution. Biphasic responses comprising both glutamatergic and GABAergic currents were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ai and Aii). At −70 mV, the slowly decaying inhibitory current was fully blocked by 10 μM gabazine leaving only a fast decaying AMPA current blocked by 10 μM CNQX). The excitatory component reversed near 0 mV as expected, and the inhibitory component reversed at −45 ± 1 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 5; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Aii). The isolated GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated component was recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV (referred to as GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ai). The decay time was significantly longer than that for GABA<sub>A,local</sub> (GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub> = 277 ± 29 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The ratio of current observed at 500 ms over 15 ms after stimulation (<italic>I</italic><sub>500ms</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>15ms</sub>) showed that GABA<sub>A,local</sub> current had decayed to approximately 5% of its peak value after 500 ms, while a substantial fraction of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> could still be observed (GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>500ms</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>15ms</sub> = 0.05 ± 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 11; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>500ms</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>15ms</sub> = 0.32 ± 0.06, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>Both GABA<sub>A,local</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> decayed significantly faster at −70 mV than at 0 mV (<italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub> = 70 ± 5 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 11, and 180 ± 10 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 6, respectively, <italic>t</italic>-test for both, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The slower decay of GABA<sub>A,local</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> at 0 mV is consistent with previous reports showing that GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents decay more slowly at depolarised potentials as receptors unbind agonist at a slower rate (<xref rid="bib22 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Mellor and Randall, 1998; Burgard et al., 1999</xref>). The currents observed at −70 mV were slower than those reported in some previous studies. Two factors might have contributed to the slower kinetics observed in our experiments: the use of BAPTA and the use of Cs-gluconate. Slower IPSC decay has been observed both during recording with BAPTA (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Banks and Pearce, 2000</xref>) and with Cs-gluconate (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stepanyuk et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are widely expressed in the SR subfield of the hippocampal CA1 area (<xref rid="bib33 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sperk et al., 1997; Sur et al., 1999</xref>), however their synaptic contribution has not been observed while stimulating locally in the SR. We therefore asked whether α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs can contribute to GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>. As a first pharmacological approach we tested the gabazine sensitivity of GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents, as it has been previously reported that a tonic inhibitory conductance mediated by α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is resistant to 1 μM gabazine (<xref rid="bib6 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2001; Caraiscos et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>To compare the gabazine sensitivity of locally-evoked and Schaffer collateral-stimulated currents, IPSCs were recorded in the presence of increasing concentrations of gabazine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bi). GABA<sub>A,local</sub> currents were abolished by 1 μM gabazine (initial amplitude, 863 ± 144 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 11) while a significant fraction of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> remained under these conditions (19 ± 3% of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> of control charge transfer remaining in 1 μM gabazine; <italic>n</italic> = 6, initial amplitude, 1261 ± 57 pA). This component is referred to as GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) Example traces are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bii.</p>
      <p>The time from stimulation to peak (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was significantly different for GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (one-way ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,21</sub> = 128; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; post-hoc <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). Both GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) showed slower kinetics compared to GABA<sub>A,local</sub> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 10–90% rise time; one-way ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,21</sub> = 51; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; post-hoc <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). The longer time-to-peak seen for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) was additionally due to longer latency (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, time from stimulus to 10% amplitude; one-way ANOVA; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,21</sub> = 75; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; post-hoc comparisons, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) <italic>versus</italic> GABA<sub>A,local</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) <italic>versus</italic> GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, both <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; GABA<sub>A,local</sub> <italic>versus</italic> GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.22).</p>
      <p>As bursting input from the Schaffer collateral could be necessary for the firing of dendritic targeting interneurons (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Maccaferri and Dingledine, 2002</xref>), we next asked whether bursting activity in this pathway could enhance GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz). Indeed this component became prominent with burst stimulation (3–4 stimuli at 100 Hz) as 49 ± 7% of inhibitory charge transfer remained in 1 μM gabazine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Ci). Remarkably, the early component (5–35 ms after stimulation) of burst responses was almost as sensitive to 1 μM gabazine as GABA<sub>A,local</sub> (fraction remaining in 1 μM gabazine: GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, 0.4 ± 1%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> (burst, 5–35 ms), 1 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.73; example traces in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Cii). A significant effect of gabazine inhibition was observed for all recording conditions (GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC(burst)</sub>; RM ANOVA. Charge transfer as the between-subjects factor, and dose as within-subject factor; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,19</sub> = 25; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; post-hoc comparisons showed that at 1 μM gabazine, each group was different from the others, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>To test whether α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contribute to the inhibitory currents described above we next investigated the effect of L-655,708, which is an inverse-agonist selective for α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in rats, mice and humans at concentrations below 20 nM (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Atack et al., 2006</xref>). After a stable baseline recording, 20 nM L-655,708 was added to the extracellular solution. The effects of L-655,708 on charge transfer and peak amplitude were estimated for GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz), with either single or burst stimulation for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). In all conditions, the average charge transfer after addition of L-655,708 was significantly different from baseline, but stronger effects were observed for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) for both single and burst stimulation (percentage of reduction: GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, 13 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, 12 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 9; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (single), 30 ± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (burst), 33 ± 3%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). A significant effect on peak was also observed for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (single) (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), but did not reach significance for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) (burst) (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.07).</p>
      <p>To corroborate our findings on the effects of L-655,708 on GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated currents, and to test the specificity of L-655,708 for α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, we next used <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice and WT littermate control mice (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Collinson et al., 2002</xref>). In this set of experiments, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> currents from WT mice showed a significant reduction from baseline following application of 20 nM L-655,708 (GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, 33 ± 4% reduction, <italic>n</italic> = 5; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz), 36 ± 4% reduction, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both), whereas L-655,708 did not significantly alter the charge transfer for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) currents in <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> slices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, B; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11; GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz), <italic>n</italic> = 7; <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.20).</p>
      <p>We additionally tested whether L-655,708 could be used as a selective inhibitor of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at concentrations higher than 20 nM during our recording conditions. We found that L-655,708 at 1 μM concentration, and even at concentrations as low as 50 nM, inhibited the GABA<sub>A</sub>R current in WT mice to a similar extent to that seen in <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (no significant difference WT <italic>versus gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7 and <italic>n</italic> = 5, respectively: 50 nM, <italic>P</italic> = 0.33, and 1 mM, <italic>P</italic> = 0.16; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C), suggesting that L-655,708 is not selective for α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at concentrations above 20 nM, and thus limiting the selective inhibition of the α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated current to no more than ∼30%. Further analysis to compare GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> currents recorded from WT and <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice revealed that the fraction of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> charge transfer that persisted after the application of 1 μM gabazine was larger in WT mice than in <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice (34.4 ± 4%, <italic>n</italic> = 11 <italic>versus</italic> 20.6 ± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 10, respectively, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>Ai, Aii, Bi). Also, the peak current was significantly different between <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> and WT mice (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>Ai, Aii, Bii).</p>
      <p>Finally, to test whether the GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents described above are mediated in part by α1/α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs receptors we tested the effects of 400 nM zolpidem (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, zolpidem increased the charge transfer of GABA<sub>A,local</sub> currents (48 ± 6%, <italic>n</italic> = 7). Also, both GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) charge transfer was enhanced (GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> by 33.3 ± 4%, <italic>n</italic> = 5, and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) by 16 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 5; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A, B). Zolpidem had a significantly different effect on currents under all recording conditions (GABA<sub>A,local</sub>, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz); one-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,32</sub> = 21.6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; post-hoc comparisons with significant differences as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>Bi).</p>
      <p>A slight increase in peak amplitude from baseline values was observed in all three recording conditions with no significant difference among them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>Bii). The large increase in charge transfer and small change in peak amplitude in response to zolpidem have been previously observed for miniature postsynaptic potentials (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Perrais and Ropert, 1999</xref>). In total, our results suggest that α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contribute significantly to GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous work investigating the subunit composition of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has measured spontaneous or stimulus-evoked GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus while blocking glutamatergic excitation. In the present study, we describe the distinct pharmacology of locally-evoked <italic>versus</italic> Schaffer collateral-stimulated GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents. GABA<sub>A,local</sub> currents were eliminated by 1 μM gabazine and were markedly enhanced by 400 nM zolpidem, whereas GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> currents were less sensitive to 1 μM gabazine and zolpidem. The gabazine-insensitive component of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> showed the greatest reduction by L-655,708 and was relatively insensitive to zolpidem, suggesting a significant proportion of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Furthermore, the gabazine-insensitive current was markedly enhanced following burst stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Finally, we confirmed the specificity of L-655,708 on GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and the gabazine-insensitive currents by recording from WT and <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
      <p>IPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons evoked by local stimulation at the SR were likely generated by perisomatic targeting interneurons, including basket cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ouardouz and Lacaille, 1997</xref>). This GABA<sub>A,local</sub> current had a <italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub> of 163 ms at 0 mV. In experiments designed to study Schaffer collateral-stimulated currents, the IPSCs decayed with a strikingly slow time constant (277 ms). GABA<sub>A,local</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> also showed significantly different time-to-peak, and 10–90% rise time. Previous studies have already shown evidence for such fast and slow components of synaptic inhibition (<xref rid="bib26 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Pearce, 1993; Banks et al., 1998</xref>). Whereas there was no significant difference in latency between GABA<sub>A,local</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>, suggesting that stimulation at the SR could also trigger direct activation of interneurons, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) also showed a longer latency, suggesting that under these conditions, a delay in activation of presynaptic interneurons contributed to the longer time-to-peak.</p>
      <p>Several possible explanations could account for the late peak and surprisingly slow decay of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> compared to GABA<sub>A,local</sub>. Firstly, using fast perfusion on excised patches from cells expressing recombinant receptors, it has been shown that subunit composition can affect decay time (<xref rid="bib40 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Tia et al., 1996; Burgard et al., 1999</xref>). Secondly, the time course of GABA concentration at the release sites would affect the response kinetics, for example the rise time responses for extrasynaptic receptors could be slowed down as has been suggested for glutamatergic synapses (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Scimemi et al., 2004</xref>). Thirdly, long exposure to GABA, either in the synaptic cleft or in extrasynaptic space, could produce the reactivation of synaptic receptors as previously shown by modifying GABA uptake kinetics (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Roepstorff and Lambert, 1994</xref>). Recent studies using somatic recordings in anatomically-identified connected cell pairs suggest that the time course of inhibitory responses can indeed be determined both by subunit composition and by distinct transmitter release transients (<xref rid="bib37 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Szabadics et al., 2007; Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>), but we cannot exclude the possibility that dendritic filtering contributes to the slow kinetics as recorded at the soma. A further possibility with potential physiological significance is that the slow rise and decay kinetics we observed for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> is due to the pattern of activation of GABAergic interneurons. For example, late-firing dendritic targeting interneurons have been shown to generate slow GABAergic events in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Maccaferri and Dingledine, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, bursts of GABA release produced by several action potentials or slow asynchronous release (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>) could contribute to slow kinetics.</p>
      <p>GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,local</sub> showed different sensitivities to gabazine. We consistently found that approximately 20% of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> charge transfer evoked by single stimulation was insensitive to 1 μM gabazine, and this fraction increased to ∼50% when using burst stimulation. We interpreted this finding as an indication of a component mediated by α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs as it has been previously shown that the tonic current mediated by these is not sensitive to 1 μM gabazine (<xref rid="bib6 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2001; Caraiscos et al., 2004</xref>). We obtained further evidence that α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are activated by Schaffer collateral stimulation by studying the effects of L-655,708 on the isolated GABA<sub>A</sub>R components described above. GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) produced either by single or burst stimulation was reduced by 30% and there was no significant difference in the amount of reduction using either type of stimulation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.27) as would be expected if in both cases the synaptically evoked current is mediated by a similar proportion of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. L-655,708 also produced a significant but smaller effect on GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,local</sub>. In previous studies, spontaneous GABA<sub>A,local</sub> currents were found not to contain an α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated component (<xref rid="bib11 bib13 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Caraiscos et al., 2004; Glykys and Mody, 2006; Zarnowska et al., 2009</xref>), however, it is likely that the sorting of populations of spontaneous IPSCs by their decay time for analysis could limit the detection of a slow component in GABA<sub>A,local</sub> currents. Furthermore, it is likely that the extracellular stimulation used to produce GABA<sub>A,local</sub> under our experimental conditions would recruit interneurons other than perisomatic targeting interneurons. It is also possible that gabazine, as a competitive antagonist, could be displaced from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by released GABA under our recording conditions for GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz). Although we do not have evidence to discard this possibility, the effects of 20 nM L-655,708 on GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> in both rat and mouse recordings without the use of gabazine strongly support a specific α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated component.</p>
      <p>We corroborated the specificity of 20 nM L-655,708 on GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) currents using <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice and WT littermate controls. There was a one third reduction in the GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) currents from initial control values following application of L-655,708 in WT mice, and no significant reduction in <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of L-655,708 activity on recombinant human GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs showed a maximum inhibition of 20% of the α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R current (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Atack et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this we found in both rat and mouse recordings that 20 nM L-655,708 inhibited approximately 30% of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz).</p>
      <p>As a final test to probe the composition of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs mediating the early and late components of inhibition, we used 400 nM zolpidem which is a highly potent and selective benzodiazepine, with α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R sparing properties (α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R, <italic>K</italic>i &gt; 15 μM, reviewed in <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sieghart, 1995</xref>). GABA<sub>A,local</sub> was markedly enhanced after application of zolpidem with a three fold increase in charge transfer compared to GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz). In comparison, GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> showed only a two fold increase compared to GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz). We interpret this result to suggest that local stimulation in SR near SP in the absence of fast synaptic excitation mostly activates perisomatic targeting interneurons, which selectively activate α1, α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Thomson et al., 2000</xref>), and that activation of Schaffer collaterals not only stimulates perisomatic targeting cells but also dendritic targeting interneurons, some of which specifically target α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Therefore, the combined results using 400 nM zolpidem and 20 nM L-655,708 suggest that GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> contains a significant population of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Thus, the present observations highlight the strong activation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs following Schaffer collateral stimulation in the hippocampus and the pharmacological analysis of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) suggests a particularly robust activation during bursting activity.</p>
      <p>Our results are consistent with previous suggestions that slow inhibition is mediated by a specific subpopulation of interneurons and molecularly distinct receptors (<xref rid="bib7 bib26 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Banks et al., 1998; Pearce, 1993; Zarnowska et al., 2009</xref>). The widespread localisation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at dendritic sites (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sperk et al., 1997</xref>) suggests that they are involved in gating dendritic excitability, for example they could be involved in regulating the generation of dendritic spikes such as those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during sharp waves (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the time course similarity of GABA<sub>A,SC</sub> and GABA<sub>A,SC</sub>(gz) to the decay kinetics of NMDA receptors (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Vicini et al., 1998</xref>) makes them well suited for inhibition of the induction of long-term potentiation by providing a shunting inhibitory effect on the NMDAR current (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Staley and Mody, 1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>The higher acquisition rate in associative memory tasks observed in mice after systemic application of the inverse-agonist L,655,708 or in <italic>gabra</italic>5<sup>−/−</sup> mice could be the expression of plasticity produced by enhanced dendritic excitation. In order to understand the cellular and network mechanisms that lead to enhanced learning after reduction of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs function it will be necessary to study the requirement for activation/silencing of inputs targeting α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on hippocampal pyramidal neurons by afferent inputs to the hippocampus and their timing in relation to the timing of somatic and dendritic spikes. Here we provide evidence of activity pattern-dependent feed-forward activation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in CA1. Testing the role of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in controlling the generation of dendritic spikes or in the fine tuning of long-term potentiation awaits the broader availability of more potent and selective drugs acting on α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, such as RO4938581 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ballard et al., 2009</xref>) or the specific activation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R-targeting interneurons <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
