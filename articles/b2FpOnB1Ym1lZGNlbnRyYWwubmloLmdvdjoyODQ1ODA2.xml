        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Synthetic sickness/lethality (SSL) can be exploited to develop therapeutic strategies for cancer. Deficiencies in the tumor suppressor proteins MLH1 and MSH2 have been implicated in cancer. Here we demonstrate that deficiency in MSH2 is SSL with inhibition of the DNA polymerase POLB, whereas deficiency in MLH1 is SSL with DNA polymerase POLG inhibition. Both SSLs led to the accumulation of 8-oxoG oxidative DNA lesions. MSH2/POLB SSL caused nuclear 8-oxoG accumulation, whereas MLH1/POLG SSL led to a rise in mitochondrial 8-oxoG levels. Both SSLs were rescued by silencing the adenine glycosylase MUTYH, suggesting that lethality could be caused by the formation of lethal DNA breaks upon 8-oxoG accumulation. These data suggest targeted, mechanism-based therapeutic approaches.</p>

        <bold>A range of tumor types, including colorectal cancers and in particular hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, are characterized by loss of either <italic>MLH1</italic> or <italic>MSH2</italic> tumor suppressor gene function. Where this occurs, <italic>MLH1</italic> or <italic>MSH2</italic> loss distinguishes tumor cells from normal cells. Here we exploit these differences to show that inhibition of particular DNA polymerases, when combined with either MLH1 or MSH2 loss, can lead to tumor cell death. These results suggest targeted therapeutic approaches to the treatment of MSH2- or MLH1-deficient cancers.</bold>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the recurrent themes of modern cancer drug discovery has been the design of therapeutic approaches that exploit the underlying genetic makeup of tumor cells. For example, the efficacy of imatinib (Gleevec) in the treatment of leukemias carrying the <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Druker et al., 2001</xref>) provides a clear demonstration of how a tumor-specific genetic change may be exploited clinically. Although targeting gain-of-function oncogenic events such as the <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion is conceptually straightforward, it is not obvious how to pharmacologically target a tumor suppressor protein that is dysfunctional or even completely absent. To address this issue, the exploitation of synthetic sickness/lethality (SSL) relationships has been proposed (<xref rid="bib18 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell et al., 1997; Kaelin, 2005</xref>). A synthetic lethal relationship between two genes or proteins exists when loss of function of either alone is compatible with viability but simultaneous loss of both causes death (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kaelin, 2005</xref>). This concept has been extended to the idea of synthetic sickness, where simultaneous mutation/loss of function of two genes impairs cellular fitness more than mutation of either gene alone (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kaelin, 2005</xref>). These concepts can be used to design therapeutic approaches that target the cancer cell-specific loss of tumor suppressor proteins (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). For example, if a tumor suppressor gene and a second gene are synthetically lethal or sick, inhibition of the second gene could selectively kill or impair the fitness of tumor cells.</p>
      <p>SSL between DNA repair proteins and pathways has the potential to be exploited clinically. For example, inhibition of the base excision repair (BER) pathway protein PARP1 is SSL with deficiency of either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor/DNA repair proteins (<xref rid="bib9 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al., 2005; Farmer et al., 2005; Fong et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, Hartwell and colleagues (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell et al., 1997</xref>) highlighted the potential for exploiting SSL interactions between mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and DNA polymerases, a hypothesis based primarily on studies in budding yeast (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 1993</xref>). For example, mutations in <italic>pol3-01</italic> (the ortholog of the human POLD catalytic subunit) are SSL with loss of the orthologs of the MMR genes <italic>EXOI</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>, <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>, and <italic>PMS1</italic> (<xref rid="bib39 bib2 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 1993; Argueso et al., 2002; Tran et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, the yeast <italic>Msh6-PolH</italic> double mutant is not viable (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pavlov et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>Msh2-pol2-4</italic> (<italic>PolE</italic>) mutants are synthetically sick (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>Germline mutations in the MMR genes <italic>MLH1</italic> or <italic>MSH2</italic> predispose to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)/Lynch syndrome, which accounts for approximately 5% of all colorectal cancer cases (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jacob and Praz, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, aberrant <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter methylation has been proposed as a cause of some sporadic colorectal cancers (<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Arnold et al., 2003; Bettstetter et al., 2007; Peltomaki and Vasen, 2004</xref>). Here, <italic>MSH2</italic> and <italic>MLH1</italic> are proposed to act as classical tumor suppressor genes, where tumor cells lose MSH2 or MLH1 function whereas normal cells retain at least one functional allele. Although other functions have been ascribed to both MSH2 and MLH1, their most well defined function is in DNA MMR (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jiricny, 2006</xref>). MMR is primarily concerned with repair of DNA lesions that occur during DNA replication, such as DNA polymerase errors that include base-base or insertion/deletion mismatches. Recent evidence suggests that MMR proteins are also involved in the repair of DNA lesions caused by oxidative damage (<xref rid="bib11 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Colussi et al., 2002; Macpherson et al., 2005</xref>). In brief, DNA mismatches are recognized by the MutSα complex, an MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer. This interaction enables MutSα to recruit the MutLα complex, itself a heterodimer consisting of the MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. MutLα binding stabilizes the MutSα:DNA interaction and acts as an interface between mismatch recognition by MutSα and additional proteins that excise and repair the DNA mismatch (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jiricny, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Reactive oxygen species, generated by sources such as the normal metabolic processes of cells as well as environmental agents, are genotoxic, producing DNA base lesions such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kamiya, 2003</xref>). At replication, 8-oxoG residues can direct the incorporation of either C or A bases, which if left unrepaired can be mutagenic, primarily by causing GC→TA transversions. Mammalian cells have a number of mechanisms for dealing with 8-oxoG lesions, including BER and also processes involving MLH1 and MSH2. Repair of 8-oxoG lesions by BER is initiated by removal of the oxidized base by the DNA glycosylase OGG1. The apurinic (AP) site that results is further processed by the endonuclease APE1. APE1 hydrolyzes the 5′ phosphodiester bond of the sugar backbone at the AP site, giving rise to a single-strand DNA break (SSB) flanked by 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5′dRp) termini. 5′dRp termini are then processed via the lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (POLB). POLB also incorporates the correct base at the SSB, after which the final break in the DNA sugar backbone is sealed by DNA ligase III to complete the repair process (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Klungland and Bjelland, 2007</xref>). The direct involvement of POLB in this pathway is indicated by the inability of lysates from <italic>Polb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells to repair synthetic 8-oxoG lesions (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). DNA polymerase γ (POLG) has been implicated in the repair of 8-oxoG lesions in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2007</xref>), and like POLB, POLG also possesses a lyase activity that allows the removal of 5′dRp termini. Both MLH1 and MSH2 have also been implicated in 8-oxoG repair, and deficiency in either gene causes an accumulation of 8-oxoG lesions (<xref rid="bib11 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Colussi et al., 2002; Macpherson et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>During replication, if adenine is inserted opposite 8-oxoG, the enzyme MUTYH excises the adenine opposite 8-oxoG, causing the formation of an abasic site (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>). This activity is thought to limit the number of GC→TA transversions that are otherwise caused by persistent 8-oxoG lesions. Further processing of the abasic sites by AP endonuclease results in the formation of SSBs (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>). Accumulation of these SSBs can present a significant threat to the integrity of the genome and the viability of cells. For example, SSBs can stall replication forks and cause the formation of potentially lethal double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saffhill and Ockey, 1985</xref>). It has also been shown that cell death caused by an accumulation of 8-oxoG lesions is dependent upon MUTYH activity and characterized by an increase in SSB formation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given the demonstration of SSL relationships involving MLH1 and MSH2 orthologs and DNA polymerases in lower organisms, we investigated whether similar SSL relationships existed in human tumor cells and explored their therapeutic potential.</p>

        <title>Synthetic Sickness/Lethality Relationships between DNA Polymerases and MMR Genes</title>
        <p>To assess SSL interactions in human cells, we used isogenic models of MLH1 or MSH2 deficiency. To model MLH1 deficiency, we used the previously characterized human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT116, which carries a homozygous mutation of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Umar et al., 1997</xref>), and its MLH1-proficient derivative HCT116+Chr3 cell line, which carries an extra human chromosome 3 expressing a functional <italic>MLH1</italic> allele (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Koi et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). To model MSH2 deficiency, we used the previously characterized human endometrial cell line HEC59, which harbors compound heterozygous <italic>MSH2</italic> nonsense mutations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Boyer et al., 1995</xref>), and its MSH2-proficient derivative HEC59+Chr2 cell line, which carries an extra human chromosome 2 expressing a functional <italic>MSH2</italic> allele (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Umar et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). We screened each of these four cell lines with a panel of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting five DNA polymerases (POL ɛ, β, η, ι, and γ: two siRNAs per gene; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 2006</xref>) and measured the effect of each siRNA on cell viability. Most strikingly, targeting of <italic>POLG</italic> was selective for MLH1 deficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1F; see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Tables S1 and S2</xref> available online) and MSH2 selectivity could be achieved by targeting <italic>POLB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). To more accurately assess the scale of these effects, we used longer-term clonogenic assays, similar to those used to assess SSL between PARP1 silencing and loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Farmer et al., 2005</xref>). In clonogenic assays, the scale of the MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG effects were similar to that observed using RNA interference-mediated silencing of PARP1 in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Farmer et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>G and 1H). To assess the generality of these observations, we used additional isogenic cell models. <italic>POLG</italic> silencing was also selective in A2780cp70 cells, where MLH1 deficiency occurs by epigenetic silencing of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Strathdee et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>A; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>), as well as in HeLa and MCF7 cells, where MLH1 and POLG were silenced by using combinations of siRNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>B). Similarly, the MSH2/POLB SSL was observed in HeLa cells with stable silencing of MSH2 deficiency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>C; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>) as well as in HeLa and MCF7 cells transfected with siRNA combinations (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>D). Both MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG SSLs were also apparent in non-tumor cells such as the human breast epithelial line MCF10A (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>E) and also in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>F–S1H). To further validate our observations, we exploited small-molecule inhibitors of POLB and POLG. Although potent or highly specific inhibitors of POLG and POLB do not currently exist, menadione is known to inhibit POLG (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2008</xref>), and masticadienonic acid inhibits POLB (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boudsocq et al., 2005</xref>). These compounds were able to elicit either MLH1 or MSH2 selectivity (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>I and S1J), supporting the observations made using RNA interference.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG SSLs, we measured <italic>POLB</italic> and <italic>POLG</italic> mRNA levels in cells with either MSH2 or MLH1 deficiencies. <italic>POLB</italic> mRNA levels were significantly higher (p = 0.025) in the MSH2-deficient HEC59 cell line than in the MSH2-proficient HEC59+Chr2 cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Similarly, <italic>POLG</italic> mRNA levels in the MLH1-deficient HCT116 cells were significantly higher (p = 0.0127) than in HCT116+Chr3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The MSH2 or MLH1 specificity of these effects was suggested by the absence of <italic>POLG</italic> mRNA upregulation in MSH2-deficient cells and an absence of POLB upregulation in MLH1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). Corresponding changes in POLB and POLG protein levels were observed in HEC59 and HCT116 cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2D), as well as in additional isogenic models of MSH2 or MLH1 deficiency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>A–S2C; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). An increase in Msh2 expression was also observed in <italic>Polb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs when compared with their wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To assess whether these alterations in POLB and POLG expression occurred in human tumors, we measured <italic>POLB</italic> and <italic>POLG</italic> mRNA levels in MSH2- or MLH1-deficient (as defined by immunohistochemistry; IHC) colorectal tumor biopsies and corresponding adjacent normal tissues. <italic>POLB</italic> mRNA levels were consistently elevated in MSH2-negative tumors compared with those in patient-matched MSH2-positive normal tissue (p = 0.0096) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). The specificity of this observation was suggested by an absence of <italic>POLG</italic> mRNA elevation in the MSH2-negative tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Similarly, MLH1-negative tumors exhibited elevated levels of <italic>POLG</italic> expression (p = 0.027), whereas <italic>POLB</italic> mRNA was not consistently altered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). In two tumor/normal matched biopsy pairs where the tumors were deficient of both MSH2 and MLH1, both <italic>POLB</italic> and <italic>POLG</italic> mRNAs were elevated in the tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and 2F). These results support the conclusion that POLB expression is elevated in MSH2-deficient tumors and POLG expression is increased in MLH1-deficient tumors.</p>
        <p>It has previously been suggested that SSL interactions between genes, proteins, and indeed pathways may be as a consequence of functional compensation or “buffering” (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kaelin, 2005</xref>). In an SSL interaction, one gene may buffer the effect of changes in a second gene but this buffering is lost when the function of both genes is absent (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kaelin, 2005</xref> and references therein). It is possible, therefore, that the increases in POLB or POLG expression in MSH2- or MLH1-deficient cells and tumors reflect such a buffering process.</p>

        <title>Increased 8-OxoG Accumulation Correlates with SSL in Both MLH1- and MSH2-Deficient Cells</title>
        <p>Given the selectivity of POLB or POLG inhibition for either MSH2 or MLH1 deficiencies and the changes in POLB or POLG expression in MSH2- and MLH1-deficient cells, we considered whether these observations could be explained by failure to repair a particular DNA lesion. We investigated whether the accumulation of 8-oxoG correlated with the MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG SSL effects. Using an ELISA method, we assessed 8-oxoG levels from DNA extracted from total cell lysates. Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, POLB silencing caused a significant increase in 8-oxoG levels in MSH2-deficient HEC59 cells when compared with MSH2-proficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). POLG silencing in MLH1-deficient HCT116 cells also resulted in an increase in 8-oxoG lesions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). These effects were reminiscent of 8-oxoG increases in <italic>Msh2<sup>−/−</sup>;Ogg1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colussi et al., 2002</xref>), and we were able to demonstrate that silencing of OGG1 by siRNA caused elevation of 8-oxoG lesions in cells deficient in MSH2 or MLH1 as well as synthetic lethality between OGG1 and MSH2 and also OGG1 and MLH1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A–S3C). Silencing of other DNA polymerases in MLH1- or MSH2-deficient cells did not elicit the same increases in 8-oxoG levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>D), suggesting that these effects were specific to POLB or POLG.</p>
        <p>We extended our observations by examining the time course of 8-oxoG formation. Silencing of POLB caused an initial increase in 8-oxoG levels in both MSH2-deficient and -proficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). However, 48 hr after POLB siRNA transfection, 8-oxoG levels started to decrease in MSH2-proficient cells but continued to rise in MSH2-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). POLG inhibition caused a very similar effect in MLH1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). These observations suggested that inhibition of specific DNA polymerases initially leads to the formation of 8-oxoG lesions that are eventually repaired in cells proficient in MLH1 or MSH2, whereas these lesions accumulate in MLH1- or MSH2-deficient cells. In these latter cells, it seems possible that the level of 8-oxoG eventually reaches a threshold that is incompatible with either cell viability or the ability to divide/proliferate.</p>
        <p>POLB has been implicated as an important nuclear DNA polymerase, whereas POLG is believed to be the only DNA polymerase active in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Loeb and Monnat, 2008</xref>). In light of this, we hypothesized that the difference in MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG SSLs might be explained by 8-oxoG accumulation in either the nucleus or mitochondria. To address this, we transfected MSH2- or MLH1-proficient and -deficient cells with control, <italic>POLB</italic>, or <italic>POLG</italic> siRNA as detailed above. However, instead of isolating and analyzing total DNA, we fractionated cells into mitochondrial and nuclear compartments, and then extracted DNA and measured 8-oxoG levels by ELISA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E–3G). Increased 8-oxoG accumulation was observed in the mitochondrial DNA fraction from the MLH1-deficient cells transfected with <italic>POLG</italic> siRNA, whereas no significant accumulation of this lesion was observed in the nuclear DNA fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). POLB silencing in MLH1-deficient cells did not, however, increase nuclear or mitochondrial 8-oxoG levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). In contrast, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA extracts isolated from MSH2-deficient cells transfected with <italic>POLG</italic> siRNA showed no increase in 8-oxoG accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). However, nuclear DNA from MSH2-deficient cells transfected with <italic>POLB</italic> siRNA demonstrated a significant increase in 8-oxoG, whereas no increase was observed in the DNA isolated from mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). These observations were further validated in additional cellular models (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>E and S3F).</p>
        <p>Repair of 8-oxoG lesions by BER is initiated by removal of the oxidized base by the DNA glycosylase OGG1. As shown above (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A–S3C), silencing of OGG1 caused elevation of 8-oxoG lesions in cells deficient in MSH2 or MLH1. We therefore examined the nuclear/mitochondrial dichotomy in MEFs expressing (1) only a nuclear isoform of human OGG1 (Nu-hOGG1), (2) a mitochondrial isoform of hOGG1 (Mt-OGG1), or (3) no OGG1 at all (OGG1 null) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>). Silencing of MLH1 caused a loss of viability in OGG1 null cells that was rescued by OGG1 expression in the mitochondria but not by OGG1 expression in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>H). Conversely, silencing of MSH2 caused loss of viability in OGG1 null cells that was rescued in cells expressing the nuclear isoform of OGG1 but not by cells expressing only a mitochondrial isoform of OGG1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>H). Taken together, these observations suggested that in MEFs, the SSL interaction between MSH2 and OGG1 was most likely mediated by loss of a nuclear OGG1 activity and that the MLH1/OGG1 SSL effect was mediated by loss of a mitochondrial OGG1 activity. It is possible that the MSH2/OGG1 and MLH1/OGG1 SSLs observed in human tumor cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A) could also be explained by a similar mechanism.</p>
        <p>Supporting the hypothesis that the MLH1/POLG SSL effect could be due to a mitochondrial dysfunction, we also demonstrated that MLH1 expression was present in both the mitochondria and the nucleus of human tumor cells, whereas MSH2 expression was restricted to the nucleus (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>G). This latter observation was also supported by a previous analysis of the mitochondrial proteome, which identified MLH1, but not MSH2, as a mitochondrial protein (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, analysis of the amino acid sequences of MSH2 and MLH1 using the MitoProt algorithm that predicts the presence or absence of mitochondrial target sequences (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>) also suggested that MLH1 was localized to the mitochondria (MLH1 P[0lg] score = 0.9188, MSH2 P[0lg] = 0.0166, where P[0lg] &gt; 0.5 indicates a predicted mitochondrial localization; the known mitochondrial protein, POLG, has a P[0lg] = 0.8941).</p>

        <title>MLH1/POLG and MSH2/POLB SSLs Are Rescued by MUTYH Silencing</title>
        <p>As cell death caused by an accumulation of 8-oxoG lesions requires MUTYH activity (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>), we investigated whether the MLH1/POLG and MSH2/POLB SSLs were also MUTYH dependent. Silencing of <italic>MUTYH</italic> rescued both MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG SSLs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>A), suggesting dependency upon MUTYH and the possibility that the formation of DSBs could explain the MSH2/POLB and MLH1/POLG lethalities. The formation of nuclear DSBs can be efficiently monitored by the detection of nuclear γ-H2AX foci (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bonner et al., 2008</xref>). Silencing of POLB elicited an elevation in γ-H2AX foci in MSH2-deficient cells, suggesting an increase in DSB formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S4</xref>B). To assess the integrity of mitochondrial DNA, we used quantitative PCR to measure relative levels of a gene located in mitochondrial DNA, <italic>COX1</italic> (aka <italic>MT-CO1</italic>) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2008</xref>). Silencing of POLG caused a significant depletion of <italic>COX1</italic> DNA in MLH1-deficient cells when compared with MLH1-proficient cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B), suggesting that the integrity of mitochondrial DNA was compromised in MLH1/POLG-deficient cells, perhaps contributing to the MLH1/POLG SSL.</p>

        <title>OGG1 Expression Is Decreased in the Absence of POLB Expression</title>
        <p>We demonstrated that POLB silencing caused an increase in 8-oxoG levels in MSH2-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The role of POLB in the repair of 8-oxoG lesions is well established and is considered to act downstream of OGG1 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boiteux and Radicella, 2000</xref>). Therefore, it was initially not clear why POLB silencing would cause an increase in 8-oxoG lesions.</p>
        <p>Like many other protein networks, components of the BER pathway are coregulated, most likely as a means to closely coordinate pathway activity. For example, expression of the BER scaffold protein XRCC1 determines the stability of other BER proteins including POLB (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, POL κ deficiency causes an increase in the persistence of UV photodimers in DNA, presumably by modulating the activity and/or stability of upstream DNA repair proteins (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ogi and Lehmann, 2006</xref>). On this basis, we reasoned that a decrease in POLB expression could modulate OGG1 expression and by this mechanism cause an increase in nuclear 8-oxoG levels in MSH2-deficient cells.</p>
        <p>POLB silencing did indeed cause a reduction in OGG1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>A), an effect that appeared specific to OGG1; the levels of the other BER proteins that we examined were not ostensibly changed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>B). Furthermore, with the exception of APE1 silencing, the inhibition of other BER proteins did not elicit SSL with either MSH2 or MLH1 deficiency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D). We also observed a decrease in Ogg1 expression in <italic>Polb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs when compared with wild-type MEFs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>E). We next investigated whether the reduction in OGG1 protein levels caused by POLB silencing could actually elicit a reduction in 8-oxoG removal, commensurate with the effects observed in the MSH2/POLB SSL. To assess this, we used an in vitro OGG1 activity assay. HeLa cells were transfected with either a nontargeting control siRNA, <italic>OGG1</italic> siRNA, or siRNA targeting <italic>POLB</italic>. Protein extracts were prepared from transfected cells and incubated with a 23 bp oligonucleotide duplex containing one <sup>32</sup>P-labeled strand with an 8-oxoG lesion at the 11th base annealed to an unlabeled complementary strand containing dC at the opposite base position to the 8-oxoG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). The oligonucleotide strands were then electrophoresed on a denaturing gel and cleaved product was detected by autoradiography (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). As expected, extracts from HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA caused cleavage of the 8-oxoG-radiolabeled strand, resulting in a labeled 10 base cleavage product (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) suggestive of normal OGG1 activity. However, cells transfected with <italic>POLB</italic> siRNA exhibited a significant decrease in OGG1-mediated cleavage of 8-oxoG similar to that observed upon silencing of OGG1 itself (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). This suggested that OGG1-mediated cleavage of 8-oxoG was most likely dependent on POLB expression.</p>
        <p>Recent work has shown that BER proteins such as POLB, ligase III, and XRCC1, when not involved in repair complexes, are ubiquitylated by the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) and then degraded by the proteasome (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>). It seemed possible, therefore, that the reduction in OGG1 levels caused by POLB silencing could also be mediated by a similar process. To assess this, HeLa cells were transfected with <italic>POLB</italic> siRNA alone or <italic>POLB</italic> and <italic>CHIP</italic> siRNA together (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). As before, POLB silencing mediated a decrease in OGG1 levels. However, OGG1 levels in POLB-silenced cells could be restored by silencing of CHIP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Furthermore, treatment of POLB-silenced cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 restored the expression of OGG1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S5</xref>F). Taken together, these results suggested that the reduction in OGG1 levels caused by a reduction in POLB expression were mediated by CHIP ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of OGG1.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In their 1997 review describing how genetic approaches may be used to identify therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer, Hartwell and colleagues used data from studies in budding yeast to highlight the potential of exploiting SSL in the treatment of cancers characterized by specific MMR gene defects (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hartwell et al., 1997</xref>). Here we show that SSLs involving MLH1 or MSH2 and DNA polymerases also exist in human tumor cells and can be exploited to specifically target cells carrying these underlying gene defects. We also investigate the characteristics of these SSLs and suggest that increases in oxidized DNA lesions may, in part at least, explain how combining such DNA repair defects limits the viability of tumor cells. We propose a model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) where <italic>MSH2</italic> gene defects, when combined with inhibition of POLB, lead to the accumulation of oxidized DNA base damage. Likewise, POLG inhibition, when imposed upon cells with MLH1 deficiency, also leads to the accumulation of oxidized DNA damage. In both scenarios, the persistent DNA lesions that occur either cause a loss of fitness by interfering with the normal operation of the cell or eventually cause the formation of more lethal DNA lesions such as double-strand DNA breaks.</p>
      <p>Although the clinical assessment of SSLs in cancer therapy is still at an early stage, the preliminary data are encouraging, with a number of patients with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation-associated cancer showing favorable and sustained responses to high-potency PARP inhibitors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fong et al., 2009</xref>). Although highly potent and selective POLB or POLG inhibitors are not yet available for use in the context of MSH2 or MLH1 deficiency, our work suggests that targeting these proteins and the pathways they control is worthy of further investigation. How might such inhibitors be used clinically? First, we propose that mechanism-based biomarkers be used to identify patients likely to respond favorably to therapy. In this case, DNA sequencing-based detection of <italic>MSH2</italic> or <italic>MLH1</italic> mutations in blood and tumor biopsies would be used (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hegde and Roa, 2009</xref>), alongside IHC detection of MSH2 and MLH1 proteins in tumor samples to confirm loss of heterozygosity (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Shia, 2008</xref>). The work presented here suggests that MSH2 and MLH1 deficiencies are associated with increased expression of POLB and POLG, respectively, and therefore IHC detection of these latter proteins in tumor biopsies may also serve as a predictive biomarker. Our work also suggests that combined MSH2/POLB or MLH1/POLG inhibition is characterized by a sustained increase in the levels of 8-oxoG. Measuring 8-oxoG using an ELISA assay may therefore provide a mechanism-based marker of drug efficacy to be used alongside more standard measures of tumor response. Finally, we propose that POLG or POLB inhibitors be used for a limited time course rather than extended periods. Such a regime would ideally maximize the antitumor response while limiting the potential for either deleterious long-term effects of DNA repair pathway inhibition or the development of drug resistance, including the potential reversion of <italic>MSH2</italic> or <italic>MLH1</italic> gene defects, as has been documented for BRCA gene defects (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>To realize the potential of our proposed synthetic lethality approach, the development of highly potent and selective POLB and POLG inhibitors is required. Although somewhat specific POLB inhibitors have already been identified, these are of low potency. For example, koetjapic acid (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 1999</xref>), pamoic acid (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2004</xref>), prunasin (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mizushina et al., 1999</xref>), solanapyrone A (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mizushina et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>trans</italic>-communic acid, mahureone A, and masticadienonic acid (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boudsocq et al., 2005</xref>) all inhibit POLB. Of these, masticadienonic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8 μM) is the most potent POLB inhibitor identified to date. The development of POLG inhibitors is also at a relatively early stage of development; vitamin K3 (VK3; menadione) is known to inhibit POLG with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the micromolar range. Interestingly, VK3 causes impairment of mitochondrial DNA replication and repair, and induces a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, leading to cellular apoptosis (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2008</xref>). Lamivudine-TP (LVD-TP), adefovir-diphosphate (ADV-DP), and tenofovir-DP (TFV-DP), as well as zalcitabine-TP (ddCTP) and zidovudine-TP (AZT-TP), all inhibit POLG activity in vitro, although the extent of inhibition varies widely (<xref rid="bib29 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 1994; Mazzucco et al., 2008</xref>). It is also worth considering whether similar synthetic lethalities could be achieved by targeting proteins other than POLB or POLG. Silencing of the DNA glycosylase OGG1 was also able to elicit selectivity in cells with either MLH1 or MSH2 deficiency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure S3</xref>A), and it is possible that the catalytic activity of this protein may be more amenable to pharmacological inhibition. It is also possible that other SSL effects could be exploited in the treatment of MMR-defective cancers. MMR-defective mouse and human cell lines have been reported to be sensitive to drugs inducing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) including CCNU (<italic>N</italic>-[2-chloroethyl]-<italic>N</italic>′-cyclohexyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea) and MMC (mitomycin C) (<xref rid="bib1 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Aquilina et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The tolerance and repair of ICLs is extremely complex and most likely involves a number of pathways including MMR, translesion synthesis, and homologous recombination (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). This interplay of these repair pathways may suggest that MMR-deficient tumor cell sensitivity to ICL-causing agents could be increased in a synergistic fashion, by inhibiting additional DNA repair pathways.</p>
      <p>We do note that the SSL involving POLB is specific to MSH2 deficiency whereas the POLG SSL is specific to cells with MLH1 defects, suggesting that the SSLs described here are genotype specific rather than being associated with MMR deficiency per se. Interestingly, there is also a growing body of evidence to suggest that MLH1 and MSH2 not only have distinct roles outside of the canonical MMR pathway but their deficiencies also lead to distinct phenotypic and clinical manifestations. For example, <italic>MLH1</italic> mutations are particularly associated with an increased risk of colonic cancers, whereas <italic>MSH2</italic> mutations have a higher incidence of extracolonic tumors (<xref rid="bib26 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Kastrinos et al., 2008; Palomaki et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, differences in MLH1 and MSH2 function have been identified that suggest that the canonical MMR pathway is perhaps but one mechanism by which these proteins maintain the integrity of the genome. Notably, the response to certain chemotherapies differs between MLH1- and MSH2-deficient tumor cells (<xref rid="bib34 bib54 bib56" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2009; Wu and Vasquez, 2008; Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), and MLH1 has been shown to regulate homologous recombination independently of MSH2 (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Siehler et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, de Souza-Pinto and colleagues report that mitochondria possess a distinct version of MMR that is MSH2 independent (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">de Souza-Pinto et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that noncanonical forms of MMR exist that are perhaps worthy of additional study.</p>
      <p>In summary, we provide the proof of principle that SSLs could be exploited to design targeted therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancers characterized by specific MMR gene defects. Clinical trials of these approaches will require the development of suitable drug-like inhibitors.</p>

        <p>Transfected cells were seeded onto coverslips. Seventy-two hours posttransfection, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then incubated with <bold>γ-</bold>H2AX antibody (Millipore) for 24 hr at 4°C. Coverslips were stained with DAPI, mounted, and viewed using a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal microscope. The experimental procedure is described in full in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p>

        <p>(B) Schematic model for in vitro OGG1 assay. Briefly, protein was isolated from transfected cells. The DNA substrate is a 23 base oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG at its 11th base, labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at its 5′ end, and annealed to its complementary strand (containing dC at the opposite base position to the 8-oxoG). Upon cleavage of the substrate by the OGG1 enzyme, the oligonucleotides were electrophoresed on a denaturing PAGE gel, followed by autoradiography.</p>
        <p>(C) HeLa cells were transfected with either control, <italic>POLB</italic>, or <italic>OGG1</italic> siRNA and incubated with an oligonucleotide substrate containing 8-oxoG, as described above. The oligonucleotides were electrophoresed and a 10 base fragment (labeled cleavage product) was revealed in addition to the original 23 base oligonucleotide. Autoradiography revealed that in the absence of POLB expression, cleavage of the 8-OHdG lesion was significantly decreased.</p>
        <p>(D) HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA, and cell lysates were analyzed 72 hr later. OGG1 expression was suppressed by <italic>POLB</italic> siRNA but rescued by combined silencing of POLB and CHIP.</p>
        <p>(E) Cell lysates from HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA and, after 48 hr, cells were treated with MG132 (50 μM). Lysates were analyzed 18 hr later by western blotting. Antibodies directed against OGG1, POLB, and β-tubulin were used to demonstrate reduction in expression of OGG1 after transfection with <italic>POLB</italic> siRNA, which was rescued by treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132.

        <p>A Model for the Selective Effects of DNA Polymerase Inhibition in MLH1- or MSH2-Deficient Cells</p>
        <p>Oxidized DNA lesions, including 8-oxoG, can be repaired by either MSH2/MLH1-dependent processes or BER. In wild-type cells, inhibition of POLB or POLG leads to repair of these lesions by MSH2/MLH1. In the absence of MSH2, POLB is essential for 8-oxoG repair. Inhibition of POLB in MSH2-deficient cells leads to the accumulation of 8-oxoG in nuclear DNA. Cells harboring these unrepaired lesions may permanently arrest or die. These effects may be mediated by MUTYH, which in attempting to reverse C→A transversions opposite oxidized bases ultimately causes the formation of single-strand DNA breaks which in turn cause the formation of lethal double-strand DNA breaks. In cells with MLH1 deficiency, POLG inhibition leads to the accumulation of 8-oxoG in mitochondrial DNA. Again, this accumulation either becomes incompatible with viability or limits the cell's replicative potential.</p>
