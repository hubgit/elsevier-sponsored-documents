      <abstract>
        <p>The Tyr402His polymorphism of complement factor H (FH) with 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). How FH contributes to disease pathology is not clear. Both FH and high concentrations of zinc are found in drusen deposits, the key feature of AMD. Heterozygous FH is inhibited by zinc, which causes FH to aggregate. Here, zinc binding to homozygous FH was studied. By analytical ultracentrifugation, large amounts of oligomers were observed with both the native Tyr402 and the AMD-risk His402 homozygous allotypes of FH and both the recombinant SCR-6/8 allotypes with Tyr/His402. X-ray scattering also showed that both FH and SCR-6/8 allotypes strongly aggregated at &gt; 10 μM zinc. The SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 fragments were less likely to bind zinc. These observations were supported by bioinformatics predictions. Starting from known zinc binding sites in crystal structures, we predicted 202 putative partial surface zinc binding sites in FH, most of which were in SCR-6. Metal site prediction web servers also suggested that SCR-6 and other domains bind zinc. Predicted SCR-6/8 dimer structures showed that zinc binding sites could be formed at the protein–protein interface that would lead to daisy-chained oligomers. It was concluded that zinc binds weakly to FH at multiple surface locations, most probably within the functionally important SCR-6/8 domains, and this explains why zinc inhibits FH activity. Given the high pathophysiological levels of bioavailable zinc present in subretinal deposits, we discuss how zinc binding to FH may contribute to deposit formation and inflammation associated with AMD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The complement system of the innate immune system is activated by the alternative pathway through the low-level spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 to form C3u (also known as C3<sub>H2O</sub>), which leads to a positive-feedback amplification of C3 cleavage to form activated C3b.<xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–3</sup></xref> While complement is targeted against pathogenic bacteria, complement-mediated host cell damage is prevented by the complement regulator factor H (FH), which acts as a cofactor for factor I to cleave C3b, competes with factor B to inhibit the formation of the C3 convertase C3bBb, and accelerates the decay of C3bBb.<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> FH is constructed from 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, each about 61 residues in length.<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The SCR domains in heterozygous and homozygous FHs form a partially folded-back structure in solution.<xref rid="bb0030 bb0035 bb0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6–8</sup></xref> FH binds to glycosaminoglycans on the host cell surface through its C-terminal region and to SCR-7, and this is followed by the decay-accelerating and cofactor activity of FH against C3b through the N-terminal region.<xref rid="bb0045 bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9–11</sup></xref> FH binds to C3b at SCR-1/4 and SCR-19/20.<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> FH also binds to other ligands such as C-reactive protein, M-protein of <italic>Streptococci</italic> bacterium, and FH-binding protein of <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic>.<xref rid="bb0065 bb0070 bb0075 bb0080" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13–16</sup></xref> FH also self-associates to form dimer, trimer, and higher oligomers.<xref rid="bb0040 bb0085 bb0090 bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,17–19</sup></xref> FH oligomerisation is strongly promoted by zinc, followed by copper.<xref rid="bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments showed that pooled native heterozygous FH aggregates strongly in the presence of ≥ 10 μM zinc or copper, and this is matched by the decrease in fluid-phase FH activity.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
      <p>FH is genetically associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the elderly in the Western population.<xref rid="bb0110 bb0115 bb0120 bb0125 bb0130" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22–26</sup></xref> FH is also involved with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, and Alzheimer's disease.<xref rid="bb0135 bb0140 bb0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27–29</sup></xref> Even with the analysis of over 100 genetic alterations, the molecular role of FH in these diseases is still unclear.<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> This lack of knowledge is attributed in part to the multivalent weak affinities of FH for its ligands, which makes experimental studies difficult.<xref rid="bb0150 bb0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> A hallmark of early AMD is the appearance and growth of subretinal pigment epithelial deposits (sRPEds) that develop within Bruch's membrane, an extracellular matrix layer interposed between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroidal vasculature.<xref rid="bb0160 bb0165 bb0170" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32–34</sup></xref> sRPEds contain oxidised lipids, carbohydrates, cellular materials, and over 140 aggregated proteins including FH and other complement components.

      <p>Zinc is abundant in the human retina.<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> It is vital for retinal cell survival and the functioning of antioxidant enzymes and the visual cycle, while an excess of zinc can be detrimental and exacerbate neuronal damage.<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Under oxidative stress during light exposure, the secretion of zinc from the zinc-rich RPE cells is elevated.<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Millimolar concentrations of zinc have been found in sRPEds and Bruch's membrane in AMD, suggesting that the pathological release of zinc from surrounding tissues like the RPE–choroid complex might be involved in deposit formation.<xref rid="bb0200 bb0210" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40,42</sup></xref> Studies of the effect of zinc supplements on reducing the development of AMD gave different results. Based on the premise that zinc is an antioxidant in retina, the large Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) indicated that supplements with zinc alone or with zinc together with vitamins C and E and β carotene reduce the risk for progression to advanced AMD.<xref rid="bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43,44</sup></xref> Interestingly, a follow-up study found that the treatment response to the AREDS-recommended zinc supplement was influenced by the Tyr402His FH polymorphism. A smaller reduction in the progression to AMD to advanced stage disease was found in patients with the FH His402 allotype than in those with the FH Tyr402 allotype.<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Zinc binding sites show a tetrahedral coordination geometry at which the binding site is often formed from surface His, Asp, Glu, and Cys residues.<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> When these zinc sites are found between two protein surfaces, between one and three residues at each surface contribute to a tetrahedral coordination involving four residues. The Tyr402His polymorphism potentially provides a new His zinc-binding ligand within the SCR-6/8 region that binds to heparin and C-reactive protein. To clarify whether the two allotypes exhibit different zinc binding properties, we studied the homozygous FH Tyr402 and His402 allotypes and the two allotypes of recombinant SCR-6/8 titrated with zinc. By AUC and synchrotron X-ray scattering, we showed that zinc interacts with both homozygous allotypes of FH. We also studied the effect of zinc on the other functionally important SCR-1/5 (binds C3b) and SCR-16/20 (binds C3b, C3d, C-reactive protein, and heparin) regions. Bioinformatics predictions supported the observation of zinc binding to SCR-6/8 and less so to SCR-1/5 or SCR-16/20. We discuss the molecular implications of our results with FH and zinc for complement regulation and sRPEd formation in AMD.</p>

        <title>Sedimentation velocity of the complexes of the two FH and SCR-6/8 allotypes with zinc</title>
        <p>The homozygous full-length FH and recombinant SCR-6/8 allotypes (Tyr402 and His402) were purified (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). During this study, the two FH allotypes were studied at a concentration of 0.7–0.8 mg/ml (4.6–5.2 μM) in order to be comparable in concentration with the physiological FH range of 0.235–0.810 mg/ml in serum.<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The SCR-6/8 allotypes were studied at 0.3 mg/ml (14.6 μM), which was the lowest concentration that produced analysable data. Both proteins were studied in Hepes buffer (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) in order to avoid the precipitation of zinc with phosphate. Both were titrated with 0–600 μM ZnSO<sub>4</sub> in ultracentrifugation and scattering experiments.</p>
        <p>AUC studies the sedimentation behaviour of macromolecules on subjecting these to a high centrifugal force in order to determine their sizes and shapes.<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using speeds of up to 60,000 rpm on two freshly prepared Tyr402 and two His402 FH allotypes at concentrations of 0.7–0.8 mg/ml, each being titrated with zinc from 0.2 μM to 200 μM. Similar sets of rapidly moving sedimentation boundaries were observed for both allotypes when [Zn] increased. Good fits to the sedimentation boundaries were obtained in all cases using sedimentation coefficient distribution analyses <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a–d and f–i). At all [Zn] values, the FH monomer was observed at a mean value of 5.67 ± 0.05 S for the Tyr402 allotype and at 5.74 ± 0.07 S for the His402 allotype at 50,000 rpm. This indicated the presence of zinc-free FH even with a 40-fold excess of zinc, meaning that the binding of zinc is weak. For both allotypes with [Zn] between 0.2 and 20 μM, additional peaks that corresponded to similar small amounts of oligomers from dimers to nonamers were visible from 7 S to 30 S that resembled those for zinc-free FH.<xref rid="bb0035 bb0040 bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8,19</sup></xref> For both allotypes with [Zn] between 60 and 200 μM, sizeable amounts of rapidly sedimenting species were observed with increased <italic>s</italic><sub>20,w</sub> values of up to 100 S in the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) distributions (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e and j). The proportions of oligomers of the FH Tyr402 and His402 allotypes were derived by integration of the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) size distribution analyses. No differences in the proportions of the FH monomer and oligomers at each zinc concentration were seen between the allotypes. Like heterozygous pooled native FH,<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> both the Tyr402 and the His402 allotypes form heavy oligomers with zinc and share similar dependences on [Zn] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a).</p>
        <p>The sedimentation boundaries showed that differential ranges of <italic>S</italic> values for the zinc-induced FH oligomers were formed with the two allotypes. For the Tyr402 and His402 allotypes with zinc in high excess at 200 μM, the oligomer peaks ranged in size with variable amounts in repeated runs with <italic>S</italic> values in excess of 100 S, indicating their sensitivity to the presence of zinc when zinc was in excess. These differences were reflected in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a–d and f–i, where the upper part of the boundaries sedimented more rapidly for the Tyr402 and His402 allotypes at all zinc concentrations. In addition, with the use of the homozygous FH proteins whose genetic heterogeneity is much reduced compared to the pooled FH used in earlier studies, it was noteworthy that the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) peaks show no sequence of well-resolved peaks with well-defined <italic>S</italic> values similar to the individual peaks 2–9 seen in zinc-free full-length FH.<xref rid="bb0035 bb0040 bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8,19</sup></xref> These further observations suggested that a broad range of zinc-induced FH oligomers of different sizes was formed through the cross-linking of different weak zinc binding sites at the surface of FH.</p>
        <p>In order to clarify the molecular basis for zinc-induced FH oligomers, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments at 50,000 rpm on the Tyr402 and His402 allotypes of the SCR-6/8 fragment at 0.3 mg/ml (14.6 μM) titrated with zinc from 0.2 μM to 600 μM. Similar sedimentation boundaries were observed for the two allotypes of SCR-6/8 at each [Zn] (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a–d). In contrast to full-length FH, no rapidly sedimenting larger species were detected in the size distribution <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) fits at any [Zn]. The <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) analyses consistently showed a major monomer peak at 2.12 ± 0.09 S and a minor dimer peak at 4.03 ± 0.20 S for the Tyr402 allotype and, likewise, two peaks at 2.19 ± 0.08 S and 3.95 ± 0.16 S for the His402 allotype (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>e). This agrees with the previous observation of SCR-6/8 monomer and dimer by sedimentation velocity, where the assignment of monomer and dimer was made based on the molecular weights derived from the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) analyses.<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, with [Zn] above 60 μM, the signal intensity of the monomer peak for both allotypes decreased significantly with an increase in [Zn] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>b and <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). This indicates that, at [Zn] above 60 μM, zinc induced the formation of aggregated SCR-6/8, which were sufficiently large to sediment to the bottom of the sample cell before the first boundary scan was recorded. While the His402 allotype showed slightly greater aggregation than the Tyr402 allotype, this may result from experimental variability in quantifying the different sedimenting species. Overall, it was noteworthy that SCR-6/8 aggregated at the same [Zn] value that caused large FH oligomers to form. This indicated that the major binding sites for zinc in full-length FH were located within SCR-6/8.</p>
        <p>The reversibility of the zinc-induced aggregation of the SCR-6/8 allotypes was studied by adding 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the ultracentrifuge cell containing 0.3 mg/ml SCR-6/8 and 300 μM zinc. After mixing, we immediately re-ran the sedimentation velocity experiment at 50,000 rpm on this cell again. Even though the size distribution <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) analyses showed that the monomer peak for both allotypes of SCR-6/8 with 300 μM zinc was much reduced, the addition of EDTA caused a significant increase in the monomer peak intensity for both allotypes (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This showed that the zinc-induced aggregation of SCR-6/8 was reversible, in good agreement with the reversibility of the zinc-induced oligomers of heterozygous pooled FH by adding EDTA.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Additional ultracentrifugation experiments with the SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 fragments in the presence of zinc were performed as controls of the SCR-6/8 experiments. SCR-1/5 is less soluble at 0.3 mg/ml when expressed, compared to SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/20. As [Zn] increased, SCR-1/5 aggregated in the same manner as SCR-6/8 at a similar [Zn] value to that for SCR-6/8, and this may reflect its lower solubility. This was visible from both the reduced intensities of the fringes as [Zn] increased and the marked reduction in the monomer peak intensity in the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) plot (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a–d). In contrast to this, SCR-16/20 is more soluble than SCR-1/5 and SCR-6/8, and SCR-16/20 remained in solution as [Zn] increased with a smaller reduction in the number of observed fringes at 600 μM. Here, the <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) plot showed a smaller reduction in the sizes of the monomer and dimer peaks, while at the same time, as many as three other species were observed (peaks 1, 2, and 3 in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>e–h). These experiments showed that other zinc-induced oligomers formed in two other regions of FH. However, unlike SCR-6/8, both SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 possessed His<sub>6</sub>-tags that may comprise potential zinc binding sites.<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> This possibility was evaluated by further zinc titrations in which a 2:1 molar ratio of nickel (17 μM) was present to saturate its binding site at the His<sub>6</sub>-tag, to which nickel binds more tightly with a dissociation constant of 1 μM than zinc.<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The resulting <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) plots showed that no SCR-1/5 or SCR-16/20 aggregates were seen and that only the monomer or monomer/dimer peaks that were similar to those observed for zinc-free protein were observed. These final experiments indicate either that the His<sub>6</sub>-tag represented an oligomeric zinc binding site and this is eliminated by the stronger binding of nickel to this or that nickel competes with zinc for weak interaction sites in FH. The first explanation is preferred because nickel has no strong effect on FH oligomer formation.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Three control experiments with full-length FH His402 in the presence of 200 μM zinc and 20 μM nickel, 200 μM zinc, or 20 μM nickel were performed to complete these studies. This showed that, in the presence of nickel, zinc still causes full-length FH to aggregate in similar quantities, even though zinc-induced oligomer formation in SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 was individually blocked by nickel. Even though these experiments are cautionary in indicating that other weak zinc binding sites in FH may exist, it was concluded that a major region for zinc-binding to FH lies in SCR-6/8.</p>

        <p>To test whether the Tyr402 and His402 allotypes of SCR-6/8 formed zinc-induced oligomers, we titrated both of them with [Zn] from 0.2 to 600 μM.

        <p>The distance distribution function <italic>P</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) of the two FH allotypes provided shape information in real space on the zinc-induced FH oligomers.

The increase in <italic>L</italic> values showed that the oligomers had increased in size compared to the monomer. For [Zn] at 20 μM, 60 μM, and 120 μM, the shapes of the <italic>P</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) curves were similar between the two allotypes, indicating that oligomers that are similar in size and conformation had formed under these conditions (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The <italic>P</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) intensities and <italic>M</italic> values were slightly higher for the His402 allotype than for the Tyr402 allotype, which is consistent with the Guinier analyses; however, the difference is not considered to be significant (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). When the <italic>P</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) analyses were repeated for the SCR-6/8 allotypes with [Zn] of up to 6 μM, <italic>L</italic> was determined to be 9 nm for both allotypes, and the curves were indistinguishable between the two allotypes (data not shown).

        <title>Bioinformatics prediction of zinc binding sites on full-length FH</title>
        <p>In order to validate the experimental data analyses above, we applied two independent bioinformatics strategies in order to predict potential tetrahedral zinc binding sites in FH. The first strategy utilised a distance-dependent, knowledge-based method that was based on known zinc binding sites. A total of 3705 proteins with Zn binding sites was identified in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and these were screened to identify the residues that were within 0.3 nm of the metal site. Zinc binding sites at the interface between two protein surfaces generally contain Asp, His, and Glu side chains as zinc coordination sites.<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Cys residues were not included in this survey because there are no exposed Cys residues in full-length FH. Accordingly, a total of 830 zinc binding sites composed of His, Glu, and/or Asp residues only was identified and classified into 33 subgroups based on their compositions. A contact matrix (CM) was defined for each subgroup that is based on the mean separation ± 1 SD between the α-carbon atoms and that between the β-carbon atoms (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). This matrix was used to screen the FH domains in order to predict potential interface zinc binding sites. For this, crystal and NMR structures for 11 SCR domains and 9 homology-modelled structures that were available at the time of this work were used (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>a).<xref rid="bb0140 bb0275 bb0280 bb0285 bb0290" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28,55–58</sup></xref> A total of 202 possible partial zinc binding sites was identified as residue pairs or triplets that could act as one-half of a tetrahedral zinc interface binding site. In some cases, a pair or triplet of residues could form a partial zinc binding site with more than one coordination geometry (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>b). In order of probability, 31% of these sites were identified in SCR-6, which had 62.5 sites, followed by 12% in SCR-3, 10% in SCR-16, 7% sites in SCR-2, and 7% sites in SCR-14. Two or fewer predicted zinc binding sites were found in five SCR domains (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>a). All the triplets were located in SCR-6 or between SCR-6 and SCR-7 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>b). The predicted highest number of zinc binding sites in SCR-6 agrees with the similar experimentally observed effect of zinc on the aggregation of both full-length FH and SCR-6/8. The predicted involvement of SCR-2, SCR-3, and SCR-16 would explain the ultracentrifugation experiments with SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 that suggest that other weak zinc binding sites may be present, assuming that these additional sites supplement the zinc-binding role of the His-tag. Even though the disease-related His402 residue may be a potential zinc-binding residue, His402 occurred in only 2 out of the 202 zinc binding sites predicted in FH. The Tyr402His polymorphism thus has a low probability of altering the interaction with zinc, and this agrees with the experimentally observed lack of difference between the Tyr402 and the His402 allotypes of FH and SCR-6/8 after zinc addition by ultracentrifugation and scattering.</p>
        <p>The second bioinformatics strategy was based on submitting the 20 crystal, NMR, and homology SCR structures to web servers that predict metal binding sites in proteins (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). METSITE was developed using relative residue positions and does not require side-chain atoms to be present; therefore, this is applicable to low-resolution structures.<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> It has a high sensitivity of 94.6% and a medium specificity of 47.8% for zinc. This method is based on recognizing residue environments in which a metal ion is likely to be found within 0.7 nm. These environments are represented by structural features such as residue β-carbon distances and solvent accessibility. When a 0.4-nm threshold was applied to the METSITE results, METSITE predicted that 26 out of 175 His, Asp, and Glu residues in FH were candidates for 13 predicted interaction sites with zinc. SCR-6 with five residues gave the highest total among the 20 SCR domains, followed by SCR-15 and SCR-20 with three each. A ranking based on the number of residues per zinc binding site (between 1.3 and 1.4) showed that SCR-6, SCR-7, SCR-8, SCR-15, and SCR-20 were the most likely domains to contain zinc binding sites.</p>
        <p>Given this outcome from both bioinformatics strategies, the crystal structure of SCR-6/8 (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2UWN">2UWN</ext-link>) was examined to see whether tetrahedral zinc binding sites were possible in SCR-6/8 dimers. A total of 195 homodimeric structures for SCR-6/8 was created using four different protein docking servers (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). All 195 dimeric structures were subjected to zinc binding site prediction using the web servers METSITE and CHED (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). METSITE identified possible tetrahedral zinc binding sites in 193 out of 195 structures, while CHED with no activated filters identified possible zinc binding sites in 91 out of 195 structures. The difference is attributed to the higher sensitivity but lower selectivity of METSITE compared to CHED.<xref rid="bb0295 bb0300" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59,60</sup></xref> The 10 most frequent possible zinc binding site residues in the 195 dimeric structures were Glu359, His360, His371, Asp370, Asp485, His332, His417, Glu462, Glu487, and Asp497 in order of frequency (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, His402 was not included in those 10 residues. This provides an explanation with the experimental observations of the lack of difference in oligomerisation between the two SCR-6/8 allotypes in the presence of zinc. In order to rationalise the outcome of these searches, we analysed the 195 putative dimeric structures with RMSDCLUST (<xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>), which superposes every pair of structures and identifies clusters of similar structures. Nine different zinc binding sites were found in seven clusters that each contained 18, 15, 4, 2, 3, 4, and 5 SCR-6/8 dimer structures, together with a single outlier that did not belong to any cluster. Only two out of the nine possible zinc binding sites possessed all the residues identified as the 10 most frequent possible zinc-binding residues. One of these binding sites involved Glu359 and His360 on each of two SCR-6/8 monomers (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>a), and the other involved His371 on one SCR-6/8 monomer and Asp485 and Glu487 on the other monomer (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>b). If zinc cross-links pairs of SCR domains in tetrahedral coordinations, the predictions in <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>a and b lead to a schematic cross-linking cartoon in which adjacent pairs of two SCR-6 domains or SCR-6 and SCR-8 domains form contacts with each other. The indefinite self-association suggested in <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>c shows how zinc may cross-link SCR-6/8 molecules to form large aggregates. As a control of this predictive approach, the same procedure was performed with three protein structures with known zinc binding sites (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These were human interferon-β, the complex of human growth hormone and prolactin, and an archaeal cytochrome P450. All the known zinc-binding residues in the three known protein structures were correctly included in the top 10 most frequently occurring residues, and this outcome supports the credibility of this predictive method for FH SCR-6/8.</p>

      <p>Such interactions of extracellular proteins with micromolar concentrations of zinc ions (as illustrated here for FH–zinc) are deemed physiologically relevant based on total zinc concentrations. During neuronal activity, Zn is released into the synaptic cleft and can reach concentrations of 300 μM.<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref> Zinc inhibition constants in micromolar ranges for kallikreins and carboxypeptidase A are also likely to be physiologically relevant because these enzymes are secreted from tissues that also secrete zinc ions. It is however stressed that this is not the case for intracellular proteins. The total cellular zinc concentration can be as high as several hundred micromolars, especially in the nervous system (which includes the eye).<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> In these cells, the cytosolic bioavailable free zinc ion concentration is in picomolar ranges, and zinc-binding proteins have very low <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values to match these.<xref rid="bb0325 bb0330" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65,66</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Overall, this study has located a major FH zinc binding site to lie within the functionally important SCR-6/8 domains, and this accounts for the inhibition of FH activity by zinc. Our two earlier studies showed that heterozygous FH aggregated in the presence of five transition metals at physiological FH concentrations, particularly at zinc and copper concentrations of ≥ 10 μM.<xref rid="bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> Zinc has the strongest effect on FH and inhibits its function. In this study, using ultracentrifugation and X-ray scattering, we have shown that similar zinc-induced aggregation occurs for both the homozygous forms of FH with either the Tyr402 or the disease-related His402 allotype. The FH Val62 or Ile62 polymorphism (which is also disease related) also has no influence on zinc binding effects. Therefore, zinc-induced aggregation is independent of FH genetic heterogeneity. Based on ultracentrifugation and scattering data, which were validated by bioinformatics predictions, we showed that SCR-6/8 is a major locus for zinc-induced aggregation through the presence of partial zinc binding sites at the FH surface. These sites can be cross-linked in the presence of zinc to form large oligomers. This daisy-chained cross-linking scheme is explained in terms of putative SCR-6/SCR-6 interactions that alternate with putative SCR-6/SCR-8 interactions (<xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>c). Control experiments with the other two functionally active regions of FH at SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 showed that both regions may also aggregate in the presence of zinc. However, further controls with added nickel indicated that this is less significant than that at SCR-6/8. This study now explains the zinc-induced formation of FH oligomers for the first time in terms of multiple weak surface zinc binding sites that are located primarily within the SCR-6/8 region. The compact nature of these FH oligomers (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) is explained by zinc binding at a central location in FH within SCR-6/8. The proximity of SCR-6/8 to the C3b-binding region of FH at SCR-1/5 explains why zinc binding inhibits FH; in addition, the SCR-6/8 domains bind to heparin and C-reactive protein. It was interesting that the Tyr402 or His402 allotype has no significant influence on zinc-induced aggregation, given that His402 might have been a potential surface zinc-binding residue.</p>
      <p>FH is a major complement regulator in blood and is expressed and secreted by many different cell types including the RPE.<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> The major physiological ligands of FH include C3b and its C3d fragment, heparin and other glycosaminoglycans, and C-reactive protein and FH self-association, in addition to zinc binding.<xref rid="bb0150 bb0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> All these ligands bind weakly to FH with micromolar affinities, and this is consistent with the relative micromolar abundance of FH in serum. The FH–zinc interaction has already been discussed previously.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Since that 2008 study, more recent studies show that C3b and C3d bind with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 3.5–14 μM and 2.6 μM, respectively,<xref rid="bb0060 bb0340" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,68</sup></xref> C-reactive protein binds with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 4–15 μM,<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and FH dimerises with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 28 μM.<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> If FH is found at 0.6 mg/ml in serum, this means that 11% of FH exists as dimers.

If C-reactive protein occurs at the acute-phase level of 0.4 mg/ml, 32% of FH will be bound to C-reactive protein if the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value is 4.2 μM. These calculations assume that no other factors in serum influence these equilibria, which have been considered separately from each other for the purpose of illustration here. In comparison to these physiological interactions, the pathophysiological interaction between FH and zinc is characterised by comparable <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values at approximately 10 μM, implying that FH will be 50% bound to zinc if bioavailable zinc is present at 10 μM. However, most of the zinc in plasma is bound to proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA),<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> and only a small proportion of this zinc is bioavailable in plasma.<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> Potentially higher bioavailable zinc levels may exist in Bruch's membrane (see below). Because two of the most frequently predicted zinc-binding residues, His360 and His371 (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), have been implicated in glycosaminoglycan binding to FH,<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> it is possible that zinc binding to FH can perturb the binding of glycosaminoglycans to FH.</p>
      <p>The comparison of zinc binding to FH and HSA is of interest. HSA is a three-domain protein that circulates in serum at reference levels between 30 and 50 mg/ml (450–750 μM).<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> HSA binds 84% of plasma zinc, and α2-macroglobulin binds 15%.<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> In HSA, a zinc binding site was identified at the protein surface interface between domain I at His67 and Asn99 and domain II at His247 and Asp249 (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:1AO6">1AO6</ext-link>) that is conserved in almost all mammalian species.<xref rid="bb0345 bb0350" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69,70</sup></xref> Here, asparagine is a rare zinc-binding ligand. Being stereochemically well-defined, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for zinc binding to HSA is lower at 1 μM compared to that of approximately 10 μM for zinc binding to FH. The larger <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for the FH–zinc interaction is explained by the lack of proximity in monomeric FH of appropriate pairs of the SCR domains that possess potential zinc-binding residues. Given the HSA  concentration of 450–750 μM and the serum zinc concentration of 12.5 μM, where HSA binds 84% of plasma zinc, the presence of HSA will reduce the level of bioavailable zinc, and accordingly, there is little risk of FH aggregation with zinc in plasma. The total zinc level in plasma remains steady at 14.7 μM even after a daily diet supplement with 80 mg zinc in the AREDS trials.<xref rid="bb0215 bb0355" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43,71</sup></xref> Therefore, since bioavailable zinc in plasma occurs in a 20- to  210-pM range,<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> normal zinc levels in plasma are too low to induce FH oligomerisation.</p>
      <p>Human ocular tissues contain unusually high concentrations of zinc.<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Zinc appears to be essential for the normal function of the retina, but its exact role is not clear.<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> In the RPE–choroidal complex, zinc is expected to be mostly bound to melanin, metallothionein, and other zinc-binding proteins, and it has been proposed that less than 10% of zinc in the retina is free or chelatable.<xref rid="bb0200 bb0205 bb0360" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40,41,72</sup></xref> RPE cells can accumulate zinc following oral supplementation and retain it longer than any other tissues in the body, but zinc might be released from the RPE through cellular damage.<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> The released zinc could then be available in the Bruch's membrane or be entrapped in sRPEds and contribute to the several hundred parts per million of zinc (mM) observed in sub-RPE deposits.<xref rid="bb0205 bb0210" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41,42</sup></xref> This RPE-released zinc might be sufficient to induce a localised aggregation of FH that has been recruited to the location because of inflammation associated with RPE damage. The comparison above with the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for FH interactions with its other ligands shows that the regulatory balance of FH activity in terms of interactions with C3b, heparin, and C-reactive protein can be disturbed by zinc binding. The main interaction of zinc with the SCR-6/8 regions, which is a locus for interactions with heparin and C-reactive protein, indicates that FH function with these two ligands will be perturbed if sufficient excess zinc is available. In addition, the indefinite self-association of FH at SCR-6/8 is expected to block the binding of the neighbouring FH SCR-1/4 domains to C3b. Such a mechanism can contribute to both the formation of sRPEds and the inhibition of the regulatory function of FH to cause inflammation and host cell damage.</p>
      <p>Daily supplements with 80 mg zinc, 2 mg copper, vitamins C and E, and β carotene are recommended by AREDS as a means of reducing the risk for progression to advanced AMD.<xref rid="bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43,44</sup></xref> Interestingly, the AREDS-recommended zinc supplements with antioxidants were recently correlated with a greater reduction in progression to advanced AMD in patients who are homozygous for the FH Tyr402 allotype (wild type; 34% of cases) compared to patients who are homozygous for the FH His402 allotype (AMD risk; 11% of cases).<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Our current study offers no direct explanation for this observation because no significant difference in zinc-induced FH aggregation was seen between the Tyr402 and the His402 allotypes of FH and SCR-6/8 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The most common coordination geometry of zinc binding sites is tetrahedral.<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Here, our bioinformatics analyses showed that 3705 zinc binding coordinations were available for analysis from the PDB. Protein interface zinc binding sites are primarily supplied by His, Glu, and Asp residues, but sites containing Cys are also found (not relevant to FH because it contains no free Cys residues), and β-sheet secondary structures predominately contribute to zinc binding sites. Zinc binding is able to induce protein self-association or link two different proteins.<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Our previous discussion of potential FH zinc binding sites<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> is now clarified by the abundance of partial zinc sites that were predicted using a distance-based algorithm, suggesting that multiple weak zinc binding sites exist in FH if zinc cross-linked FH. This outcome predicts that a range of different zinc-induced oligomers will form at several sites. This multiplicity of oligomers is in good agreement with the observation of many overlapping peaks in the ultracentrifugation <italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) size distribution analyses (i.e., the opposite of the formation of fewer well-resolved signals such as the nine peaks observed for FH alone<xref rid="bb0040 bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,19</sup></xref>) and also with the formation of indefinite oligomers at high zinc concentrations. The prediction of multiple sites also explains better why different types of FH oligomers were observed with different metals such as copper.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Finally, the predictions were also informative in that they explained the lack of difference seen between the SCR-6/8 Tyr402 and the His402 allotypes because His402 was not predicted to be a significant zinc-binding ligand. These analyses provide insight into the weak binding of zinc to other plasma proteins. It is possible that the outcome of this FH–zinc study will be applicable to other plasma proteins. For example, we have observed that zinc will induce oligomer formation in C3 (K. Li and S.J.P., unpublished data).</p>
      <p>In summary, our results contribute to a better understanding of how zinc might be involved in two distinct and different ways that contribute to AMD.<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> In early AMD, zinc release may trigger sRPEd formation and contribute to the growth of these deposits through oligomerisation of proteins including FH. This will lead not only to deposit formation but also to uncontrolled inflammation, the two hallmarks for the development of this blindness condition. In late AMD, however, zinc supplementation could slow disease progression through a currently unidentified mechanism. This, however, is unlikely to involve FH oligomerisation.</p>

        <title>Fluid-phase activity assays</title>
        <p>To determine activities, we incubated the reaction mixtures containing 0.3 mg/ml FH, 0.3 mg/ml C3u, and 0.003 mg/ml factor I in a water bath at 37 °C in three concentrations of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (0 μM, 120 μM, and 200 μM). The functions of two pairs of the two allotypes of FH were tested. The FH Tyr402 allotype 013HH and the FH His402 allotype 015LT were tested with 0 μM and 200 μM zinc, and the FH Tyr402 allotype 022LM and the His402 allotype 032KO were tested with 120 μM zinc. At timed intervals,  5-μl aliquots were removed for reducing SDS-PAGE analyses. Three blank controls were used, namely, 0.3 mg/ml C3u; 0.3 mg/ml C3u, and 0.3 mg/ml FH and 0.3 mg/ml C3u, 0.3 mg/ml FH, and zinc. The C3 α-chain band densities from SDS-PAGE were measured using the gel analysis system SYNGENE (Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The C3 α-chain cleavage was referenced to the averaged density of the uncleaved bands in the controls.</p>

        <title>Molecular prediction of surface zinc binding sites</title>
        <p>Two independent database analyses were used to predict partial protein-interface-type zinc binding sites on protein surfaces. In the first one, a data set of 3705 Zn-binding protein crystal structures with resolutions better than 0.3 nm was identified from the PDB. Residues that were located within 0.3-nm distance of the zinc atom were assigned as putative zinc-coordinating residues using a PERL script to scan the PDB. Of the 4883 putative zinc binding sites that were identified, a total of 830 zinc binding sites composed of His, Glu, and/or Asp as zinc coordination residues was analysed and classified into 33 subgroups based on the amino acid composition of each site. In each subgroup, the distance <italic>x</italic> between the C<sup>α</sup> atoms <italic>i</italic> and that between the C<sup>β</sup> atoms <italic>j</italic> of each zinc-coordinating residue were calculated as a residue pair type <italic>x</italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) and stored in a CM (contact matrix). For each residue pair in CM, the average distance x̄ and its standard deviation σ were calculated. An algorithm was implemented to screen each protein structure of interest for residues that form putative partial Zn binding sites. For a given protein structure, solvent-exposed Asp, His, and Glu side chains were identified. A residue is considered exposed if its side chain has a relative surface accessibility greater than 20%. The geometric distances between pairs and triplets of C<sup>α</sup> atoms and C<sup>β</sup> atoms of the putative zinc-coordinating residues were calculated. If these distances fall within the distance cutoff x̄ ± σ, then the pair or triplet of residues become considered as possible zinc-coordinating residues. Using this algorithm, we screened 11 experimental SCR crystal or NMR structures for SCR-1/2, SCR-2/3, SCR-5, SCR-6/8, SCR-15/16, and SCR-19/20<xref rid="bb0140 bb0275 bb0280 bb0285" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28,55–57</sup></xref> and 9 homology-modelled SCR structures for SCR-4, SCR-9, SCR-10, SCR-11, SCR-12, SCR-13, SCR-14, SCR-17, and SCR-18.<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
        <p>The second prediction of partial metal binding sites in FH was carried out using web servers. In this, the 20 experimental and homology SCR structures in FH were evaluated using METSITE<xref rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn">†</xref>,<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> which uses a set of neural network classifiers trained to identify potential cation sites. Following this analysis, potential zinc sites at dimer interfaces were studied. To form FH dimer structures, we docked the SCR-6/8 His402 crystal structure (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2UWN">2UWN</ext-link>) using four different docking approaches available as web servers including ClusPro<xref rid="fn0010" ref-type="fn">‡</xref>, HEX<xref rid="fn0015" ref-type="fn">§</xref>, PatchDock<xref rid="fn0020" ref-type="fn">||</xref>, and RosettaDock<xref rid="fn0025" ref-type="fn">¶</xref>.<xref rid="bb0410 bb0415 bb0420 bb0425 bb0430 bb0435" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82–87</sup></xref> These four docking programs were selected according to their performance in the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions surveys.<xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr"><sup>88</sup></xref> These possible dimeric structures were tested again by METSITE and another web server, CHED,<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> to detect possible tetrahedral zinc binding sites at the protein interface in the dimeric structures. The CHED web server<xref rid="fn0030" ref-type="fn">a</xref> searches for Cys, His, Glu, and Asp residues with atoms within several specified distances to each other and a 0.27-nm distance to the putative zinc atom position. If the distances do not match, an independent rotamer library is used to find an appropriate fit configuration. The sites found in CHED are filtered by a decision tree and a support vector machine to verify their suitability. The dimeric structures that possess zinc binding sites predicted by METSITE and CHED were clustered using the program RMSDCLUST (D.T.J., unpublished software) to group similar structures. RMSDCLUST carries out rigid-body superposition between each pair of dimeric structures, computes the α-carbon RMSD, and then clusters all pairs of structures within an adjustable RMSD threshold (0.6 nm in this case). To validate the methods, we performed the same predictions with three zinc binding structures as benchmarks, namely, human interferon-β (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:1AU1">1AU1</ext-link>), the complex of human growth hormone and prolactin (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:1BP3">1BP3</ext-link>), and thermophilic cytochrome P450 from <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:1F4T">1F4T</ext-link>).<xref rid="bb0445 bb0450 bb0455" ref-type="bibr"><sup>89–91</sup></xref></p>

The left panel shows a close-up view of the zinc-binding residues, while the right panel shows the overall structure of the putative dimer. The distances between each zinc ligand atom (nitrogen or oxygen) are displayed in nanometers. (b) A second predicted zinc binding site is composed of a His371 side chain in SCR-6 of the first SCR-6/8 monomer and the Asp485 and Glu487 side chains in SCR-8 of the second SCR-6/8 monomer (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Other details follow (a). (c) A mechanistic model for the zinc-induced aggregation of SCR-6/8 based on the two possible zinc binding sites shown in (a) and (b) shows how the two zinc sites may form a daisy chain of SCR-6/8 that leads to aggregation and precipitation.</p>
