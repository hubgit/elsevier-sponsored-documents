        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Glutamine plays multiple roles in the CNS, including metabolic functions and production of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. It has been proposed to be taken up into neurons via a variety of membrane transport systems, including system A, which is a sodium-dependent electrogenic amino acid transporter system. In this study, we investigate glutamine transport by application of amino acids to individual principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in acutely isolated rat brain slices. A glutamine transport current was studied in patch-clamped neurons, which had the electrical and pharmacological properties of system A: it was sodium-dependent, had a non-reversing current-voltage relationship, was activated by proline, occluded by N-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB), and was unaffected by 2-aminobicyclo-[2.2.1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH). Additionally, we examined the expression of different system A transporter isoforms using immunocytochemical staining with antibodies raised against system A transporter 1 and 2 (SAT1 and SAT2). Our results indicate that both isoforms are expressed in MNTB principal neurons, and demonstrate that functional system A transporters are present in the plasma membrane of neurons. Since system A transport is highly regulated by a number of cellular signaling mechanisms and glutamine then goes on to activate other pathways, the study of these transporters <italic>in situ</italic> gives an indication of the mechanisms of neuronal glutamine supply as well as points of regulation of neurotransmitter production, cellular signaling and metabolism in the native neuronal environment.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the interstitial fluid of the CNS, with a concentration in the range of 0.2–0.5 mM (<xref rid="bib49 bib71 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al., 1985; Reichel et al., 1995; Kanamori and Ross, 2004</xref>), which is over an order of magnitude higher than any other amino acid. It is not known to have any direct neurotransmitter action, but does play several important roles within the CNS including production of proteins, pyrimidine nucleotides, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The intracellular glutamine concentration is thought to be in the millimolar range, and transport into neurons occurs against a substantial concentration gradient, which requires energy-dependent transport proteins (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Erecinska and Silver, 1990</xref>).</p>
    <p>The main transport systems for glutamine are systems A, ASC, B<sup>0</sup>, B<sup>0,+</sup>, b<sup>0,+</sup>, L, N, and y<sup>+</sup>L (reviewed by <xref rid="bib11 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Bode, 2001; Broer, 2008</xref>). Systems ASC, b<sup>0,+</sup>, L and y<sup>+</sup>L are obligate exchangers, swapping internal and external amino acids across the plasma membrane. In contrast, systems A, B<sup>0</sup>, and B<sup>0,+</sup> use the energy derived by the sodium gradient to power the uptake of amino acids in an electrogenic manner, without counter-transporting another amino acid. System N co-transports sodium and counter-transports a proton, resulting in a transport process that is close to energetic equilibrium and can mediate the uptake or release of amino acids under physiological conditions (<xref rid="bib28 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1999; Broer et al., 2002</xref>). Glutamine transporter expression in the CNS has been observed for system A isoforms SAT1 (also called SA2, SNAT1, NAT2, GlnT and ATA1: <xref rid="bib93 bib95 bib29 bib64" ref-type="bibr">Varoqui et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000; Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Melone et al., 2004</xref>) and SAT2 (also called SA1, SNAT2 and ATA2: <xref rid="bib72 bib87 bib102 bib43 bib65 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al., 2000; Sugawara et al., 2000a; Yao et al., 2000; Gonzalez-Gonzalez et al., 2005; Melone et al., 2006; Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>); system ASC (ASCT2: <xref rid="bib18 bib37 bib101" ref-type="bibr">Broer et al., 1999; Dolinska et al., 2004; Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>); system B<sup>0</sup> (B0AT2: <xref rid="bib48 bib90 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 1996; Takanaga et al., 2005; Broer et al., 2006</xref>); system B<sup>0,+</sup> (ATB<sup>0,+</sup>: <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Sloan and Mager, 1999</xref>); system b<sup>0,+</sup> (rBAT/b<sup>0,+</sup>AT: <xref rid="bib8 bib91 bib97" ref-type="bibr">Bertran et al., 1992; Tate et al., 1992; Wells and Hediger, 1992</xref>); system L (LAT1 and LAT2: <xref rid="bib54 bib74 bib79" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 1998; Rossier et al., 1999; Segawa et al., 1999</xref>); system N (SN1/SNAT3 and SN2/SNAT5: <xref rid="bib28 bib25 bib66 bib14 bib16 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1999, 2001; Nakanishi et al., 2001; Boulland et al., 2002, 2003; Cubelos et al., 2005</xref>) and system y<sup>+</sup>L (y<sup>+</sup>LAT2: <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Broer et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
    <p>As most studies use radiolabelled substrates to study the properties of transport systems in bulk tissue or cultured cells, the cellular localization and functional properties of these different transporters <italic>in vivo</italic> is uncertain. To investigate glutamine transport in individual, identified neurons in their native physiological environment, we recorded amino acid-induced transporter currents using whole-cell patch-clamping in acutely isolated rat brain slices. <italic>In situ</italic> recordings were made from principal neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), which are neurons in the auditory brainstem that receive mainly excitatory glutamatergic input, and release glycine, GABA and glutamate at synapses in the adjacent medial and lateral superior olives (MSO and LSO; <xref rid="bib86 bib1 bib10 bib26 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Spangler et al., 1985; Adams and Mugnaini, 1990; Bledsoe et al., 1990; Chaudhry et al., 1998; Gillespie et al., 2005</xref>). These cells have a spherical cell body with only a small dendritic tree (<xref rid="bib84 bib60" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1998; Leao et al., 2008</xref>), which allows for precise recording of somatic currents and eliminates artifacts due to dendritic filtering (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>). The astrocytes surrounding the principal neurons in the MNTB have been shown to strongly express the system N transporters SN1 and SN2 (<xref rid="bib14 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Boulland et al., 2002; Cubelos et al., 2005</xref>), which are thought to be responsible for the export of glutamine from the glial compartment (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1999</xref>). System N and system A transporters in adjacent cells have been proposed to form a system N–system A shuttle (<xref rid="bib27 bib41 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2002a; Gammelsaeter et al., 2009; Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>), which would transfer glutamine from glia to neurons. In support of this hypothesis, our electrophysiological and immunocytological data show that MNTB principal neurons express functional system A glutamine transporters on their soma. This provides a valuable insight into the possible mechanisms that these neurons employ for amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism.</p>

        <p>Brain slices were obtained from 10 to 15 day old Wistar rats, killed by decapitation in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. All animal experiments were approved by the relevant local authorities (University of Cambridge, UK and University of Oslo, Norway), and every effort was taken to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize any suffering. Brains were quickly removed into a solution at approximately 0 °C containing (in mM) 250 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> +5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4). Transverse brainstem slices, approximately 150 μm thick, were cut using an Integraslice 7550PSDS (Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK), and slices were placed in an incubation chamber maintained at 37 °C for half an hour, before being allowed to cool to room temperature and used within the next 6 h. The incubation chamber contained artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), which comprised (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> +5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4).</p>

        <title>Electrophysiological recording</title>
        <p>MNTB neurons were visualized with infrared differential interference contrast (IR–DIC) optics on a Nikon E600FN microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60×, numerical aperture 1.0, water immersion, fluor lens. Slices were perfused at a rate of approximately 1 ml/min with aCSF (as above) at a temperature of 31–35 °C. In all experiments, except for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A–C, a cocktail of channel inhibitors was added to the recording solution, containing (in μM) 40 dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), 10 dizocilpine maleate (MK801), 10 bicuculline, 1 strychnine, 1 TTX (tetrodotoxin) and 20 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline −7-sulfonamide (NBQX). In the experiments recorded in 0 mM sodium solution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> were replaced by choline chloride and choline bicarbonate, respectively, and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was replaced by KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (with a corresponding reduction in KCl concentration and increase in choline chloride concentration to balance the other ions). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from MNTB cells using thick-walled glass pipettes (GC150F-7.5; Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) with a HEKA EPC-10 double amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze GmbH; Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). The intracellular solution contained (in mM) 110 Cs-methanesulfonate, 40 4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 20 sucrose, 0.2 ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 2 MgATP, 0.5 NaGTP, and 8 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.2 with ∼10 mM CsOH). A measured liquid junction potential of 3 mV was not corrected for. Recording pipette open-tip resistances were 5–8 MΩ and whole-cell access resistances were &lt;30 MΩ. Lucifer Yellow (&lt;0.05%) was added to the internal solution to allow confirmation of the post synaptic recording site by fluorescent imaging following the completion of the experiment. MNTB cells were voltage-clamped at −70 mV (unless stated) and currents were filtered at 10 and 2.9 kHz, and digitized at 25 kHz. Glutamine (or other amino acids) were dissolved in the relevant external solution and applied by pressure ejection (5–10 p.s.i.) from a patch pipette (as above, open tip resistance 4–6 MΩ) using a Picospritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ, USA). Puff applications were repeated at 30 s intervals. When applying two different glutamine concentrations, or glutamine in different external solutions, two puffer pipettes were used. The pipettes were a pair pulled from one piece of glass and therefore had the same tip diameter, were attached to the same pressure source and were placed equidistant from the cell.</p>

        <p>Male Wistar rats, 200–300 g, were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to transcardial perfusion fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The brains were dissected out and kept in fixative over night. 40–50 μm thick coronal sections were cut by a vibratory microtome. Immunoperoxidase staining was done as described previously (<xref rid="bib26 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1998; Boulland et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, free-floating sections were treated with 1 M ethanolamine (pH 7.4), followed by incubation with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The sections were incubated in solution of 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub> in buffer A (0.3 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100) prior to incubation with the primary antibodies in the same solution. Following incubation in biotinylated secondary antibodies and the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex, the immunoreaction was demonstrated by addition of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>The affinity-purified antibodies against SAT1 and SAT2 have been characterized and were used as described previously (<xref rid="bib23 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Buntup et al., 2008; Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>). SAT1 was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, while SAT2 was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The specificity of the immunoreaction was confirmed by pre-incubating the antibodies with the corresponding glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (30–100 μg) used for immunization of the rabbits.</p>
        <p>For fluorescent immunocytochemistry, 13–14 day old rats were used and stained as previously described (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Billups, 2005</xref>). SAT1 and SAT2 antibodies (as above) were used at 0.5 and 0.25 μg/ml respectively, and secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 2 μg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were visualized with a confocal microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Tissue was mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to label nuclei for positive identification of MNTB cells.</p>

There was no significant run-down or run-up of the current magnitude following whole-cell recording, with stable recordings being observed for many 10s of minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). The EC<sub>50</sub> of I<sub>gln</sub> was estimated by applying different glutamine concentrations to the neurons, using the two puffer pipettes with one containing 10 mM glutamine and the other containing 1, 5 or 20 mM. The dose–response curve is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D, fitted with a Michaelis–Menten equation (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>=0.94±0.25 mM).</p>

        <p>If I<sub>gln</sub> is mediated by a transporter, external glutamine application would be expected to produce an inward current at all membrane voltages. We therefore investigated the current–voltage (I/V) relationship of I<sub>gln</sub> by varying the holding potential (from −80 mV to +40 mV in 20 mV steps) prior to, and for the duration of, the glutamine application. I<sub>gln</sub> is reduced, but still inward, at positive membrane potentials, with an average magnitude of −11±2 pA at +40 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A; <italic>n</italic>=6, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), i.e. a 47±3% reduction of the current observed at −80 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B).

        <title>The glutamine transport current is sodium-dependent</title>
        <p>The majority of glutamine transport systems rely on the transmembrane sodium gradient to power the uptake process. Consequently, we investigated the sodium-dependence of I<sub>gln</sub> by removing all of the external sodium and replacing it with choline. I<sub>gln</sub> evoked by 10 mM glutamine application in normal (152 mM) sodium was −27.1±1.0 pA, and this was completely eliminated (−0.2±1.0 pA; <italic>n</italic>=7; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) by the removal of external sodium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

        <title>Contamination of the glutamine by glutamate</title>
        <p>MNTB somata express a high number of ionotropic glutamate receptors, and exhibit excitatory synaptic currents of approximately 10 nA in magnitude (<xref rid="bib5 bib13 bib78" ref-type="bibr">Barnes-Davies and Forsythe, 1995; Borst et al., 1995; Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). The relatively high affinity of the glutamate receptors (2–20 μM; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Patneau and Mayer, 1990</xref>) means that even a very small contamination of the 10 mM glutamine solution with glutamate would cause a substantial glutamate-mediated current. To guard against this possibility we investigated the magnitude of the glutamate-induced current, and inhibited it pharmacologically. To simulate a 0.05% glutamate contamination, as has been previously observed with commercially sourced glutamine (<xref rid="bib77 bib100" ref-type="bibr">Sands and Barish, 1989; Yamada and Rothman, 1989</xref>), 5 μM <sc>l</sc>-glutamate was applied to MNTB neurons by puff application (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). An inward current of −7.6±0.9 pA was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A<sub>1</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=5), which was completely inhibited (to −0.1±0.1 pA) by a cocktail of channel inhibitors containing 40 μM APV, 10 μM MK801, 10 μM bicuculline, 1 μM strychnine, 1 μM TTX and 20 μM NBQX (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>A<sub>2</sub> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> A<sub>3</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=5; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). However, in contrast, the glutamine induced current was not eliminated by the channel inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). I<sub>gln</sub> (−24±3 pA; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B<sub>1</sub>) was slightly reduced (−20±2 pA) by the channel inhibitor cocktail (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B<sub>2</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=8; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). This 4 pA (17%) reduction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C) is likely to be the result of a minor (&lt;0.05%) glutamate contamination in the glutamine solution. All other electrophysiological experiments (<xref rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1–5</xref>) were performed in the presence of this cocktail of inhibitors. Under these conditions, I<sub>gln</sub> has neither the electrical properties (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), ion dependence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) nor pharmacological profile (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) of a glutamate receptor-mediated current. A small amount of contaminating glutamate could possibly activate the electrogenic high-affinity excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). The transporter EAAT1 (also called glutamate/aspartate transporter-GLAST) is strongly expressed in the glia cells surrounding the MNTB principal cells (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Renden et al., 2005</xref>). However, the EAAT3 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1-EAAC1) transporter, which is known to be present in the somatodendritic compartment of post synaptic neurons (<xref rid="bib53 bib75 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kanai and Hediger, 1992; Rothstein et al., 1994; Danbolt, 2001</xref>), is less strongly expressed in the MNTB (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Renden et al., 2005</xref>). To explore the possible involvement of these transporters in the observed membrane current, we applied the broad-spectrum EAAT inhibitor <sc>dl</sc>-threo-b-benzyloxyaspartate (<sc>dl</sc>-TBOA; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Shimamoto et al., 1998</xref>). Application of 200 μM <sc>dl</sc>-TBOA had no significant effect on I<sub>gln</sub>, which was −14.9±2.4 pA in control and −14.5±1.8 pA in the presence of TBOA (99±4% of control; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D; <italic>n</italic>=4, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). The glutamine evoked current is therefore not a result of activation of EAATs, either by glutamine itself or by a small amount of contaminant glutamate.</p>

        <title>The glutamine currents are mediated by system A transport activity</title>
        <p>To elucidate which glutamine transport system is responsible for generating the currents in MNTB neurons, we investigated the pharmacological properties of I<sub>gln</sub>. The two main electrogenic, sodium-dependent, glutamine transporters expressed in neurons are system A and system B<sup>0</sup>. System A transporters are characteristically sensitive to the competitively transported amino acid analogue <italic>N</italic>-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 1965</xref>), and are unaffected by 2-aminobicyclo-[2.2.1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, 1990</xref>). In contrast, system B<sup>0</sup> transporters are competitively inhibited by BCH, but are unaffected by MeAIB (<xref rid="bib82 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Sloan and Mager, 1999; Broer et al., 2004, 2006</xref>). We therefore examined MeAIB-induced currents and I<sub>gln</sub> in the presence of MeAIB or BCH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Puff application of 10 mM MeAIB induced an inward current of −7.4±0.8 pA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub>2</sub>), which is 34±2% of I<sub>gln</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B; <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), consistent with MeAIB being a transported substrate for this carrier with a slower maximal transport rate. Additionally, glutamine and MeAIB can be shown to be acting on the same transporter as the continued presence of MeAIB in the bathing solution occludes I<sub>gln</sub>: 10 mM MeAIB reduced I<sub>gln</sub> to −3.6±0.4 pA (by 80±3%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub><italic>3</italic></sub>; <italic>n</italic>=15, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and 20 mM reduced it to −1.0±0.4 pA (by 96±2%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub><italic>4</italic></sub>; <italic>n</italic>=4, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Ten millimolar BCH had no significant effect on the current, with I<sub>gln</sub> being −15.6±2.1 pA (84±4% of control; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub><italic>5</italic></sub> and <italic>B</italic>; <italic>n</italic>=6, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). These results indicate that I<sub>gln</sub> is mediated by system A transport and not by system B<sup>0</sup>.</p>
        <p>Two isoforms of the system A transporters have been proposed to be present in neurons, SAT1 and SAT2. While they both transport glutamine, they differ in their transport rates for <sc>l</sc>-proline. The proline transport rate of SAT2 is greater than glutamine transport rate, showing an increase in current of between 10 and 100% (<xref rid="bib72 bib29 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al., 2000; Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>). The proline transport rate for SAT1 is between 60 and 90% lower than the glutamine transport rate (<xref rid="bib29 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>). By alternately applying 10 mM of either glutamine or <sc>l</sc>-proline via the two puffer pipettes, we investigated the relative magnitude of the proline current. The proline-induced current (I<sub>pro</sub>) was a similar magnitude to I<sub>gln</sub> (−24.8±2.6 pA; 116±7% of control; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub><italic>6</italic></sub> and <italic>B</italic>; <italic>n</italic>=12, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). MeAIB (10 mM) reduced I<sub>pro</sub> to −5.8±1.7 pA (by 72±6%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A<sub><italic>6</italic></sub> and <italic>B</italic>; <italic>n</italic>=4, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), which is comparable to the competitive inhibition of I<sub>gln</sub>. The relatively large magnitude of I<sub>pro</sub> and its inhibition by MeAIB indicate that at least part of I<sub>gln</sub> must be mediated by SAT2, but does not rule out the possibility that both SAT1 and SAT2 contribute to the glutamine current in these cells. In contrast to <sc>l</sc>-proline, <sc>d</sc>-proline induces a greatly reduced current (−2.1±0.9 pA; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B; <italic>n</italic>=5; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), consistent with the stereo-specificity of system A transport (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Varoqui et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further investigate which of the system A transporter isoforms contribute to I<sub>gln</sub> in the MNTB, we performed immunocytochemical staining using antibodies raised against SAT1 and SAT2 proteins. Immunoreactivity for both SAT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, C) and SAT2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, D) was detected in large neuronal-like cell bodies in the MNTB, indicating the presence of these transporters in the principal neurons. No reactivity was observed in the axons of the trapezoid body fibers, which traverse this brain region. The staining is abolished by preincubation of the antibodies with the GST fusion protein used during the immunization of the rabbits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>A′, B′), which confirms the specificity of the antibodies for SAT1 and SAT2. Combined with the electrophysiological data, this provides strong evidence that both SAT1 and SAT2 contribute to the glutamine-induced current that we observe in these neurons.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that MNTB neurons use membrane transporters to take up glutamine in a sodium-dependent and electrogenic manner. The current-voltage relationship reveals that the current induced by external glutamine is always inward, even at considerably positive membrane voltages. This is indicative of a transporter current, and is consistent with the inward rectification observed for system A transporters expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes or HEK293T/17 cells (<xref rid="bib29 bib62 bib104" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Mackenzie et al., 2003; Zhang and Grewer, 2007</xref>). The observed I<sub>gln</sub> is not an artifact of glutamate contamination of the glutamine solution, as it does not have the pharmacology of a glutamate transporter or receptor mediated current, and the voltage dependence is inconsistent with activation of a non-specific cation channel.</p>
      <p>The electrical and pharmacological profile of the current is consistent with it being mediated by system A transport, and excludes the involvement of all other transport systems: the glutamine current is sodium-dependent, unlike the transport mediated by systems L (<xref rid="bib54 bib74 bib79" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 1998; Rossier et al., 1999; Segawa et al., 1999</xref>) and b<sup>0,+</sup> (<xref rid="bib8 bib91 bib97" ref-type="bibr">Bertran et al., 1992; Tate et al., 1992; Wells and Hediger, 1992</xref>). Of the sodium-dependent transporters, ASCT2 (<xref rid="bib92 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Utsunomiya-Tate et al., 1996; Broer et al., 1999</xref>) and y<sup>+</sup>L (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Broer et al., 2000</xref>) are electroneutral, so cannot contribute to the observed current. The system N transporters SN1 and SN2 are sodium-dependent and can be electrogenic as a result of an uncoupled proton flux (<xref rid="bib28 bib25 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1999, 2001; Broer et al., 2002</xref>). Although they are highly expressed in the MNTB, expression is limited to glial cells and they are absent from the MNTB principal neurons (<xref rid="bib14 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Boulland et al., 2002; Cubelos et al., 2005</xref>). All of these transporters (L, b<sup>0,+</sup>, ASCT2, y<sup>+</sup>L and N) do not transport proline and are insensitive to MeAIB. The system B<sup>0</sup> transporter B<sup>0</sup>AT2 does transport glutamine and proline in an electrogenic, sodium-dependent manner. However, it cannot be the mediator of the current we observe as B<sup>0</sup>AT2 is insensitive to MeAIB and is inhibited by BCH. In addition, the transport efficiency for proline is much higher than that for glutamine (<xref rid="bib90 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Takanaga et al., 2005; Broer et al., 2006</xref>), which is contrary to our observations. The related system B<sup>0,+</sup> transporter ATB<sup>0,+</sup> is also an electrogenic glutamine transporter. However, its expression in the brain is limited, it is sensitive to BCH and it does not transport proline (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Sloan and Mager, 1999</xref>). System A is therefore the only transport system that fulfills the criteria of sodium-dependent, electrogenic transport of glutamine and proline, in an MeAIB sensitive and BCH insensitive manner. The MeAIB induced current is 34% of the magnitude of I<sub>gln</sub>, which is very similar to the relative MeAIB current observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing SAT1 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2002b)</xref> or SAT2 (<xref rid="bib72 bib87 bib102" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al., 2000; Sugawara et al., 2000a; Yao et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to system A, the proton/amino acid transporters PAT1 and PAT2 have also been shown to transport MeAIB (<xref rid="bib30 bib31 bib56" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2003ab; Kennedy et al., 2005</xref>), however unlike the currents that we observe, they are sodium-independent and not selective for <sc>l</sc>-over <sc>d</sc>-proline (<xref rid="bib76 bib12 bib99 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sagne et al., 2001; Boll et al., 2002; Wreden et al., 2003; Foltz et al., 2004</xref>). These results additionally implicate system A as the sole mediator of I<sub>gln</sub>.</p>
      <p>Which isoforms of the system A family could be involved in producing the membrane current we observe? System A transporters belong to the solute carrier <italic>SLC38</italic> gene family (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Sundberg et al., 2008</xref>), three members of which (<italic>SLC38A1</italic>, <italic>A2</italic> and <italic>A4</italic>) have been ascribed to system A. The <italic>SLC38A1</italic> transporter protein (SAT1) is expressed mainly in neurons (<xref rid="bib93 bib95 bib29 bib62 bib64 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Varoqui et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000; Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Mackenzie et al., 2003; Melone et al., 2004; Buntup et al., 2008</xref>) whereas the <italic>SLC38A2</italic> protein (SAT2) is expressed in many tissues, including neurons and potentially in glia (<xref rid="bib72 bib87 bib102 bib43 bib65 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Reimer et al., 2000; Sugawara et al., 2000a; Yao et al., 2000; Gonzalez-Gonzalez et al., 2005; Melone et al., 2006; Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>SLC38A4</italic> transporter (SAT3, SNAT4 or ATA3) is exclusively located in liver, skeletal muscle, placenta and olfactory bulb (<xref rid="bib88 bib46 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sugawara et al., 2000b; Hatanaka et al., 2001a; Desforges et al., 2006</xref>), and not in the brainstem (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Sundberg et al., 2008</xref>). Our immunocytological data indicate the presence of two glutamine transporter isoforms, SAT1 and SAT2, in MNTB neurons. This finding is supported by our electrophysiological data, which show a proline response that is neither significantly greater (as expected for SAT2) nor significantly smaller (as for SAT1) than the glutamine response. In addition, we observe a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for glutamine of 0.94±0.25 mM, which lies in between the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s observed for SAT1 (0.3–0.4 mM) and SAT2 (1.7–2.3 mM) when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref rid="bib102 bib29 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2000; Chaudhry et al., 2002b; Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>). The magnitude of the proline current and intermediate glutamine affinity are consistent with a mixture of SAT1 and SAT2 currents in our recordings. While membrane currents mediated by system A transporters have previously been shown in single cell expression systems, our study is the first to demonstrate system A transporter currents recorded in neurons <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>
      <p>What is the role of glutamine transport into neurons? Under normal physiological conditions it is thought that glutamine is transported out of glial cells by system N transport and into neurons by system A (<xref rid="bib28 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 1999, 2002</xref>a; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>). A similar system N—system A glutamine shuttle has also been proposed to occur in the pancreas, where it may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gammelsaeter et al., 2009</xref>). Our current finding of SAT1 and SAT2 localization in the principal neurons of MNTB surrounded by SN1 and SN2 expressing glial processes (<xref rid="bib14 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Boulland et al., 2002; Cubelos et al., 2005</xref>) corroborate the complementary expression of the system N and system A transporters seen in other brain regions and consent with the notion that these transporters work in concert to transport glutamine from glial cells to neurons (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2002a)</xref>. Moreover, inhibition of system A <italic>in vivo</italic> results in a 1.8 fold rise in the extracellular glutamine concentration and dramatically reduces the intracellular concentrations of glutamate (<xref rid="bib55 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kanamori and Ross, 2004; Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>), underlining the importance of system A transport in amino acid flux into neurons (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Rae et al., 2003</xref>). Since neurons lack pyruvate carboxylase (<xref rid="bib103 bib80" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 1983; Shank et al., 1985</xref>), they are thought incapable of anaplerotic replenishment of TCA cycle intermediates from glucose. It is therefore vital that they are able to import longer carbon chain molecules, such as glutamine, to replenish those lost through release of neurotransmitters or through other metabolic processes. In support of this notion, it has been observed that approximately 50% of the glutamine applied to cultured neurons is metabolized via the TCA cycle (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Waagepetersen et al., 2005</xref>). Glutamine has been proposed to be directly utilized as a precursor for the neurotransmitter glutamate, in the classically described glutamate–glutamine cycle (<xref rid="bib7 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Benjamin and Quastel, 1972; Hamberger et al., 1979</xref>). This has been shown to occur under physiological conditions in the retina (<xref rid="bib6 bib69" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2000; Poitry et al., 2000</xref>) and in hippocampal cell culture and slices (<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Armano et al., 2002; Bacci et al., 2002</xref>), although this hypothesis has recently been challenged (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kam and Nicoll, 2007</xref>). Glutamine, via the production of glutamate, is also a precursor for the inhibitory transmitter GABA (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Sonnewald et al., 1993</xref>), and system A transport in this pathway has been demonstrated to contribute to the maintenance of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib61 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2006; Fricke et al., 2007</xref>). The MNTB neurons used in this study are principally glycinergic, but also release GABA as a co-transmitter (<xref rid="bib96 bib26 bib59 bib58 bib83" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 1990; Chaudhry et al., 1998; Kotak et al., 1998; Korada and Schwartz, 1999; Smith et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, they have been shown to release glutamate in a vesicular manner from their presynaptic terminals, which is most prominent early on in development (post-natal days 1–8), but also persists at older ages (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2005</xref>). It is therefore likely that the transport of glutamine into these neurons is involved in maintenance of their neurotransmitter pool. This glutamate release is mediated by the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), which is expressed both in the presynaptic terminals and the MNTB somata (<xref rid="bib15 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Boulland et al., 2004; Gillespie et al., 2005</xref>). Somatodendritic expression of VGLUT3 could also mediate glutamate release as a retrograde messenger (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Harkany et al., 2004</xref>), with a mechanism that has previously been shown to be dependent on system A glutamine transport into neurons (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jenstad et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>As a consequence of its important role in amino acid flux and cell metabolism, system A transport is noted for its high degree of regulation by a number of environmental stimuli (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">McGivan and Pastor-Anglada, 1994</xref>). These include downregulation in ischemic preconditioning (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Kamphuis et al., 2007</xref>), upregulation in response to starvation or amino acid deprivation (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Kilberg et al., 2005</xref>), subtype dependent regulation by agents that increase cAMP (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Hatanaka et al., 2001b)</xref>, and a rapid induction of expression of SAT1 by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Burkhalter et al., 2007</xref>). Glutamine that is transported into cells (by system A; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al., 2009</xref>) is also used to power tertiary active transport of essential amino acids (such as leucine) via system L, which then go on to activate signaling pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; <xref rid="bib4 bib67" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al., 2009; Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>). Its involvement in these signaling pathways places system A at the heart of many cellular physiological processes. Hence, our demonstration of neuronal system A transporter currents <italic>in situ</italic> will allow further investigation of the role that this transporter plays in coordinating the cellular response to neuronal activation.</p>

        <p>Glutamine-induced currents (I<sub>gln</sub>) are observed in whole-cell voltage-clamped MNTB neurons. (A) Differential interference contrast image of a patch-clamped MNTB neuron in the brain slice. The cell (*), patch pipette (arrow) and two puffer pipettes (arrow heads) are shown. The scale bar is 10 μm.

        <p>Glutamate receptor and transporter currents do not contribute to the observed glutamine current. (A) Puff application of 5 μM glutamate induces an inward current (A<sub>1</sub>; −7.6±0.9 pA; <italic>n</italic>=5), which is completely eliminated (A<sub>2</sub>; −0.1±0.1 pA; <italic>n</italic>=5; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) by bath application of a cocktail of ion channel inhibitors containing 40 μM APV, 10 μM MK801, 10 μM bicuculline, 1 μM strychnine, 1 μM TTX and 20 μM NBQX. (B): Without glutamate, GABA and glycine receptor inhibitors in the bathing solution, I<sub>gln</sub> was −24±3 pA (C<sub>1</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=7). Bath application of the channel inhibitors reduces I<sub>gln</sub> to −20±2 pA (C<sub>2</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=8; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). All other electrophysiological experiments (<xref rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1–5</xref>) were done in the presence of this cocktail of inhibitors. (C): The fractional reduction of I<sub>gln</sub> by the channel inhibitors is 17±2% (<italic>n</italic>=8; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 shown by the asterisks), indicating only a minor contamination current. (D): Application of 200 μM <sc>dl</sc>-TBOA, to inhibit glutamate transporters, has no effect on I<sub>gln</sub> recorded in the presence of the channel inhibitors. I<sub>gln</sub> in control was −14.9±2.4 pA and in TBOA was −14.5±1.4 pA (99±4% of control; <italic>n</italic>=4, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05).</p>

        <p>I<sub>gln</sub> is mediated by system A transporters. (A) Compared to I<sub>gln</sub> (A<sub>1</sub>), the transported system A analogue MeAIB (10 mM) induces a reduced current of −7.4±0.8 pA (A<sub>2</sub>; <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). In the presence of 10 mM (A<sub>3</sub>, grey trace) or 20 mM MeAIB (A<sub>4</sub>, grey trace), I<sub>gln</sub> (black traces) is inhibited. The presence of 10 mM BCH (A<sub>5</sub>, grey trace), which inhibits B<sup>0</sup> transporters, does not reduce I<sub>gln</sub> (A<sub>5</sub>, black trace). Puff-application of 10 mM <sc>l</sc>-proline (A<sub>6</sub>, black trace) produces a transport current of comparable magnitude to 10 mM glutamine, which is similarly inhibited by 10 mM MeAIB (grey trace). B: Normalized data showing the relative magnitude of the MeAIB induced current (34±2%; <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), I<sub>gln</sub> inhibition by 10 mM MeAIB (80±3% reduction; <italic>n</italic>=15; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and 20 mM MeAIB (96±2%; <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Ten millimolar BCH had no significant effect on I<sub>gln</sub> (16±4% reduction; <italic>n</italic>=6; <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). The <sc>l</sc>-proline-induced current is a similar magnitude to I<sub>gln</sub>, (<italic>n</italic>=12; <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), and it is inhibited by 72±6% by the addition of 10 mM MeAIB to the bath (<italic>n</italic>=4, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). <sc>d</sc>-proline induces a current that is much smaller (5±3%) than the <sc>l</sc>-proline current (<italic>n</italic>=5; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.001 are indicated by the asterisks over the appropriate bars.</p>

        <p>Two system A transporters, SAT1 and SAT2, are localized to the cell bodies of the principal neurons of the MNTB. Coronal sections were cut through the rat auditory brainstem and immunoperoxidase-stained using affinity-purified antibodies generated against SAT1 and SAT2. (A): Strong SAT1 immunoreactivity is detected in neuron-like cell bodies in the adult MNTB leaving the trapezoid body fibers unstained. (A′) This staining pattern is abolished upon preincubation of the antibodies with the immunizing GST fusion protein. (B) SAT2 immunoreactivity is also pronounced in the cell bodies of scattered neurons in between trapezoid body fibers in the adult MNTB. (B′) Only faint diffuse background staining remained in this nucleus upon preincubation of the SAT2 antibody with the GST fusion protein used to immunize the rabbits. C and D: Fluorescent immunocytochemical staining of SAT1 (C) and SAT2 (D) in 13–14 day old rats, showing strong labeling in MNTB principal cells bodies. The scale bar in all panels is 50 μm.</p>
